It is informative and innova- tive, without losing any of its hallmark coverage and readability.” Professor Robert Logie, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom “The best student’s handbook on cognitive psychology – an indispensable volume brought up-to-date in this latest edition. It explains everything from low-level vision to high-level consciousness, and it can serve as an introduc- tory text.” Professor Philip Johnson-Laird, Stuart Professor of Psychology, Emeritus, Princeton University, United States “I frst read Eysenck and Keane’s Cognitive Psychology: A Student’s Handbook in its third edition, during my own undergraduate studies. Over the course of its successive editions since then, the content – like the feld of cognition itself – has evolved and grown to encompass current trends, novel approaches and supporting learning resources. It remains, in my opinion, the gold standard for cognitive psychology textbooks.” Dr Richard Roche, Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychology, Maynooth University, Ireland “Eysenck and Keane have once again done an excellent job, not only in terms of keeping the textbook up-to-date with the latest studies, issues and debates; but also by making the content even more accessible and clear without compromising accuracy or underestimating the reader’s intelligence. After all these years, this book remains an essential tool for students of cog- nitive psychology, covering the topic in the appropriate breadth and depth.” Dr Gerasimos Markopoulos, Senior Lecturer, School of Science, Bath Spa University, United Kingdom “Eysenck and Keane’s popular textbook ofers comprehensive coverage of what psychology students need to know about human cognition. The text- book introduces the core topics of cognitive psychology that serve as the fundamental building blocks to our understanding of human behaviour. The authors integrate contemporary developments in the feld and provide an accessible entry to neighboring disciplines such as cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.” Dr Motonori Yamaguchi, Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychology, University of Essex, United Kingdom Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:20:04.","evidence":["Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:17:53.","“This edition of Eysenck and Keane has further enhanced the status of Cognitive Psychology: A Student’s Handbook, as a high benchmark that other textbooks on this topic fail to achieve."]}

What are the main reasons for the rapid rate of progress within cognitive psychology since the seventh edition of this textbook? Below we identify two factors that have been especially important. First, the overarching assumption that the optimal way to enhance our understanding of cognition is by combining data and insights from several diferent approaches remains exceptionally fruitful. These approaches include traditional cognitive psychology; cognitive neuropsychology (study of brain-damaged patients); computational cognitive science (development of computational models of human cognition); and cognitive neuroscience (combining information from behaviour and from brain activity). Note that we use the term “cognitive psychology” in a broad or general sense to cover all these approaches. The above approaches all continue to make extremely valuable con- tributions. However, cognitive neuroscience deserves to be singled out – it has increasingly been used with great success to resolve theoretical controversies and to provide novel empirical data that foster theoretical developments. Second, there has been a steady increase in cognitive research of direct relevance to real life. This is refected in a substantial increase in the number of boxes labelled “in the real world” in this edition com- pared to the previous one. Examples include eyewitness confdence, mis- hearing of song lyrics, multi-tasking, airport security checks and causes of plane crashes. What is noteworthy is the increased quality of real-world research (e.g., more sophisticated experimental designs; enhanced theoret- ical relevance). With every successive edition of this textbook, the authors have had to work harder and harder to keep with huge increase in the number of research publications in cognitive psychology. For example, the frst author wrote parts of the book in far-fung places including Botswana, New Zealand, Malaysia and Cambodia. His only regret is that book writing has sometimes had to take precedence over sightseeing!

This interest is refected in the substantial upsurge of scientifc research within cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. In addition, the cognitive approach has become increasingly infuential within clinical psychology. In that area, it is recognised that cognitive processes (especially cognitive biases) play a major role in the development (and successful treatment) of mental disorders (see Chapter 15). In similar fashion, social psychologists increasingly focus on social cognition. This focuses on the role of cognitive processes in infuencing individuals’ behaviour in social situations. For example, suppose other people respond with laughter when you tell them a joke. This laughter is often ambiguous – they may be laughing with you or at you (Walsh et al., 2015). Your subsequent behaviour is likely to be infuenced by your cognitive interpretation of their laughter. What is cognitive psychology? It is concerned with the internal pro- cesses involved in making sense of the environment and deciding on appropriate action. These processes include attention, perception, learn- ing, memory, language, problem solving, reasoning and thinking. We can defne cognitive psychology as aiming to understand human cognition by observing the behaviour of people performing various cognitive tasks. However, the term “cognitive psychology” can also be used more broadly to include brain activity and structure as relevant information for under- standing human cognition. It is in this broader sense that it is used in the title of this book. Here is a simple example of cognitive psychology in action. Frederick (2005) developed a test (the Cognitive Refection Test) that included the following item: A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? ___ cents Chapter 1 KEY TERMS Social cognition An approach within social psychology in which the emphasis is on the cognitive processing of information about other people and social situations.

(2015) found in a review of fndings from 41,004 individuals that 68% produced the wrong answer (typically 10 cents) and only 32% gave the right answer (5 cents). Even providing fnancial incentives to produce the correct answer failed to improve performance. The above fndings suggest most people will rapidly produce an incor- rect answer (i.e., 10 cents) that is easily accessible and are unwilling to devote extra time to checking that they have the right answer. However, Gangemi et al. (2015) found many individuals producing the wrong answer had a feeling of error suggesting they experienced cognitive uneas- iness about their answer. In sum, the intriguing fndings on the Cognitive Refection Test indicate that we can fail to think efectively even on rela- tively simple problems. Subsequent research has clarifed the reasons for these defciencies in our thinking (see Chapter 12). The aims of cognitive neuroscientists overlap with those of cognitive psychologists. However, there is one major diference between cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology in the narrow sense. Cognitive neu- roscientists argue convincingly we need to study the brain as well as behav- iour while people engage in cognitive tasks. After all, the internal processes involved in human cognition occur in the brain. Cognitive neuroscience uses information about behaviour and the brain to understand human cog- nition. Thus, the distinction between cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology in the broader sense is blurred. Cognitive neuroscientists explore human cognition in several ways. First, there are brain-imaging techniques of which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is probably the best-known. Second, there are electrophysiological techniques involving the recording of electrical signals generated by the brain. Third, many cognitive neuroscientists study the efects of brain damage on cognition. It is assumed the patterns of cog- nitive impairment shown by brain-damaged patients can inform us about normal cognitive functioning and the brain areas responsible for various cognitive processes. The huge increase in scientifc interest in the workings of the brain is mirrored in the popular media – numerous books, flms and television programmes communicate the more accessible and dramatic aspects of cognitive neuroscience. Increasingly, media coverage includes coloured pic- tures of the brain indicating the areas most activated when people perform various tasks. Four main approaches We can identify four main approaches to human cognition (see Table 1.1). Note, however, there has been a substantial increase in research combin- ing two (or even more) of these approaches. We will shortly discuss each approach in turn and you will probably fnd it useful to refer back to this chapter when reading the rest of the book. Hopefully, you will fnd Table 1.3 (towards the end of this chapter) especially useful because it sum- marises the strengths and limitation of all four approaches.

Behaviourism was the dominant approach to psychology throughout the frst half of the twentieth century. The American psychologist John Watson (1878–1958) is often regarded as the founder of behaviourism. He argued that psychologists should focus on stimuli (aspects of the immediate situation) and responses (behaviour produced by the par- ticipants in an experiment). This approach appears “scientifc” because it focuses on stimuli and responses, both of which are observable. Behaviourists argued that internal mental processes (e.g., attention) cannot be verifed by reference to observable behaviour and so should be ignored. According to Watson (1913, p. 165), behaviourism should “never use the terms consciousness, mental states, mind, content, introspectively verifable and the like”. In stark contrast, as we have already seen, cogni- tive psychologists argue it is of crucial importance to study such internal mental processes. Hopefully, you will be convinced that cognitive psycholo- gists are correct when you read how the concepts of attention (Chapter 5) and consciousness (Chapter 16) have been used fruitfully to enhance our understanding of human cognition. It is often claimed that behaviourism was overthrown by the “cog- nitive revolution”. However, the reality was less dramatic (Hobbs & Burman, 2009). For example, Tolman (1948) was a behaviourist but he did not believe internal processes should be ignored. He carried out studies in which rats learned to run through a maze to a goal box containing food. When Tolman blocked of the path the rats had learned to use, they rapidly learned to follow other paths leading in the right general direction. Tolman concluded the rats had acquired an internal cognitive map indicating the maze’s approximate layout. It is almost as pointless to ask “When did cognitive psychology start?”, as to enquire “How long is a piece of string?”. However, 1956 was crucially TABLE 1.1 APPROACHES TO HUMAN COGNITION 1. Cognitive psychology: this approach involves using behavioural evidence to enhance our understanding of human cognition. Since behavioural data are also of great importance within cognitive neuroscience and cognitive neuropsychology, cognitive psychology’s infuence is enormous. 2. Cognitive neuropsychology: this approach involves studying brain-damaged patients to understand normal human cognition. It was originally closely linked to cognitive psychology but has recently also become linked to cognitive neuroscience. 3. Cognitive neuroscience: this approach involves using evidence from behaviour and the brain to understand human cognition. 4. Computational cognitive science: this approach involves developing computational models to further our understanding of human cognition; such models increasingly incorporate knowledge of behaviour and the brain. A computational model takes the form of an algorithm, which consists of a precise and detailed specifcation of the steps involved in performing a task. Computational models are designed to simulate or imitate human processing on a given task.

At a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Noam Chomsky presented his theory of language, George Miller discussed the magic number seven in short-term memory (Miller, 1956) and Alan Newell and Herbert Simon discussed the General Problem Solver (see Gobet and Lane, 2015). In addition, there was the frst systematic attempt to study concept formation from the cognitive perspective (Bruner et al., 1956). The history of cognitive psychology from the perspective of its classic studies is discussed in Eysenck and Groome (2015a). Several decades ago, most cognitive psychologists subscribed to the information-processing approach based loosely on an analogy between the mind and the computer (see Figure 1.1). A stimulus (e.g., a problem or task) is presented, which causes various internal processes to occur, leading eventually to the desired response or answer. Processing directly afected by the stimulus input is often described as bottom-up processing. It was typically assumed only one process occurs at a time: this is serial processing, meaning the current process is completed before the onset of the next one. The above approach is drastically over- simplifed. Task processing typically also involves top-down processing, which is pro- cessing infuenced by the individual’s expec- tations and knowledge rather than simply by the stimulus itself. Read what it says in the triangle (Figure 1.2). Unless you know the trick, you probably read it as “Paris in the spring”. If so, look again: the word “the” is repeated. Your expectation it was a well- known phrase (i.e., top-down processing) dominated the information available from the stimulus (i.e., bottom-up processing). The traditional approach was also over- simplifed in assuming processing is typically serial. In fact, more than one process typi- cally occurs at the same time – this is parallel processing. We are much more likely to use parallel processing when performing a highly practised task than a new one (see Chapter 5). For example, someone taking their frst driving lesson fnds it very hard to control the car’s speed, steer accurately and pay attention to other road users at the same time. In con- trast, an experienced driver fnds it easy. There is also cascade processing: a form of parallel processing involving an overlap of diferent processing stages when someone performs a task. More specifcally, later stages of processing are initiated before one or more earlier stages have fnished. For example, suppose you are trying to work out the meaning of a visually presented word. Figure 1.1 An early version of the information processing approach. Figure 1.2 Diagram to demonstrate top–down processing. KEY TERMS Bottom-up processing Processing directly infuenced by environmental stimuli; see top-down processing. Serial processing Processing in which one process is completed before the next one starts; see parallel processing.

In fact, people often engage in cascade processing – they form hypotheses as to the word that has been presented before identifying all the letters (McClelland, 1979). An important issue for cognitive psychologists is the task-impurity problem – most cognitive tasks require several processes thus making it hard to interpret the fndings. One approach to this problem is to con- sider various tasks all requiring the same process. For example, Miyake et al. (2000) used three tasks requiring deliberate inhibition of a dominant response: (1) The Stroop task: name the colour in which colour words are pre- sented (e.g., RED printed in green) and avoid saying the colour word (which has to be inhibited). You can see for yourself how hard this task is by naming the colours of the words shown in Figure 1.3. (2) The anti-cascade task: inhibit the natural tendency to look at a visual cue and instead look in the opposite direction. People typically take longer to perform this task than the control task of simply looking at the visual cue. (3) The stop-signal task: respond rapidly to indicate whether each of a series of words is an animal or non-animal; on key trials, there was a computer-emitted tone indicating that the response should be inhibited. Miyake et al. (2000) found all three tasks involved similar processes. They used complex statistical techniques (latent variable analysis) to extract what KEY TERMS Parallel processing Processing in which two or more cognitive processes occur at the same time. Cascade processing Later processing stages start before earlier processing stages have been completed when performing a task. Figure 1.3 Test yourself by naming the colours in each column. You should name the colours rapidly in the frst three columns because there is no colour-word confict. In contrast, colour naming should be slower (and more prone to error) when naming colours in the fourth and ffth columns.

Throughout this book, we will discuss many ingenious strategies used by cognitive psychologists to identify the processes used in numerous tasks. Strengths Cognitive psychology was for many years the engine room of progress in understanding human cognition and the other three approaches listed in Table 1.1 have beneftted from it. For example, cognitive neuropsychology became important 25 years after cognitive psychology. It was only when cognitive psychologists had developed reasonable accounts of healthy human cognition that the performance of brain-damaged patients could be understood fully. Before that, it was hard to decide which patterns of cognitive impairment were theoretically important. In a similar fashion, the computational modelling activities of com- putational cognitive scientists are typically heavily infuenced by pre- computational psychological theories. Finally, the great majority of theories driving research in cognitive neuroscience originated within cognitive psychology. Cognitive psychology has not only had a massive infuence on theoris- ing across all four major approaches to human cognition. It has also had a predominant infuence on the development of cognitive tasks and on task analysis (how a task is accomplished). Limitations In spite of cognitive psychology’s enormous contributions, it has several limitations. First, our behaviour in the laboratory may difer from our behaviour in everyday life. Thus, laboratory research sometimes lacks ecological validity – the extent to which laboratory fndings are applicable to everyday life. For example, our everyday behaviour is often designed to change a situation or to infuence others’ behaviour. In contrast, the sequence of events in most laboratory research is based on the experiment- er’s predetermined plan and is uninfuenced by participants’ behaviour. Wachtel (1973) used the term implacable experimenter to describe this state of afairs. We must not exaggerate problems associated with lack of ecological validity. As we will see in this book, there has been a dramatic increase in applied cognitive psychology in which the emphasis is on investigat- ing topics of general importance. Such research often has good ecological validity. Note that it is far better to carry out well-controlled experiments under laboratory conditions than poorly controlled experiments under naturalistic conditions. It is precisely because it is considerably easier for researchers to exercise experimental control in the laboratory that so much research is laboratory-based. Second, theories in cognitive psychology are often expressed only in verbal terms (although this is becoming less common). Such theories are vague, making it hard to know precisely what predictions follow from them and thus to falsify them. These limitations can largely be overcome by KEY TERMS Ecological validity The applicability (or otherwise) of the fndings of laboratory studies to everyday settings.

Third, difculties in falsifying theories have led to a proliferation of diferent theories on any given topic. For example, there are at least 12 diferent theories of working memory (see Chapter 6). Another reason for the proliferation of rather similar theories is the “toothbrush problem” (Mischel, 2008): no self-respecting cognitive psychologist wants to use anyone else’s theory. Fourth, the fndings obtained using any given task or paradigm are sometimes specifc to that paradigm and do not generalise to other (appar- ently similar) tasks. This is paradigm specifcity. It means some fndings are narrow in scope and applicability (Meiser, 2011). This problem can be minimised by developing theories accounting for performance across several tasks or paradigms. For example, Anderson et al. (2004; discussed later in this chapter) developed a comprehensive theoretical architecture or frame- work known as the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model. Fifth, cognitive psychologists typically obtain measures of performance speed and accuracy. These measures are very useful but provide only indi- rect evidence about internal cognitive processes. Most tasks are “impure” in that they involve several processes, and it is hard to identify the number and nature of processes involved on the basis of speed and accuracy measures. COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY Cognitive neuropsychology focuses on the patterns of cognitive perfor- mance (intact and impaired) of brain-damaged patients having a lesion (structural damage to the brain caused by injury or disease). According to cognitive neuropsychologists, studying brain-damaged patients can tell us much about cognition in healthy individuals. The above idea does not sound very promising, does it? In fact, however, cognitive neuropsychology has contributed substantially to our understanding of healthy human cognition. For example, in the 1960s, most memory researchers thought the storage of information in long- term memory depended on previous processing in short-term memory (see Chapter 6). However, Shallice and Warrington (1970) reported the case of a brain-damaged man, KF. His short-term memory was severely impaired but his long-term memory was intact. These fndings played an important role in changing theories of healthy human memory. Since cognitive neuropsychologists study brain-damaged patients, we might imagine they would be interested in the workings of the brain. In fact, many cognitive neuropsychologists pay little attention to the brain itself. According to Coltheart (2015, p. 198), for example, “Even though cognitive neuropsychologists typically study people with brain damage, . . . cognitive neuropsychology is not about the brain: it is about information-processing models of cognition.” An increasing number of cognitive neuropsychologists disagree with Coltheart. They believe we should consider the brain, using techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging to identify the brain areas damaged in any given patient. They are also increasingly willing to study the impact of brain damage on brain processes using various neuroimaging techniques.

Here we will discuss these assumptions and briefy consider rele- vant evidence. One key assumption is modularity, meaning the cognitive system consists of numerous modules or processors operating fairly independently or separately of each other. It is assumed these modules exhibit domain specifcity (they respond to only one given class of stimuli). For example, there may be a face-recognition module that responds only when a face is presented. Modular systems typically involve serial processing with processing within one module being completed before processing starts in the next module. As a result, there is very limited interaction among modules. There is some support for modularity from the evolutionary approach. Species with larger brains generally have more special- ised brain regions that could be involved in modular processing. However, the notion that human cognition is heavily modular is hard to reconcile with neuroimaging evi- dence. The human brain possesses a moder- ately high level of connectivity (Bullmore & Sporns, 2012; see p. 14), suggesting there is more parallel processing than assumed by most cognitive neuropsychologists. The second major assumption is that of anatomical modularity. According to this assumption, each module is located in a specifc brain area. Why is this assumption important? Cognitive neuropsychologists are most likely to make progress when studying brain patients with brain damage limited to a single module. Such patients may not exist if there is no anatomical modularity. Suppose all modules were distributed across large brain areas. If so, the great majority of brain-damaged patients would sufer damage to most modules, making it impossible to work out the number and nature of their modules. There is evidence of anatomical modularity in the visual processing system (see Chapter 2). However, there is less support for anatomical modularity with most complex tasks. For example, consider the fndings of Yarkoni et al. (2011). Across over 3,000 neuroimaging studies, some brain areas (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; anterior cingulate cortex) were activated in 20% of them despite the great diversity of tasks involved. The third major assumption (the “universality assumption”) is that “Individuals . . . share a similar or an equivalent organisation of their cog- nitive functions, and presumably have the same underlying brain anatomy” Max Coltheart.

KEY TERM Modularity The assumption that the cognitive system consists of many fairly independent or separate modules or processors, each specialised for a given type of processing.

If this assumption (also common within cognitive neuroscience) is false, we could not readily use the fnd- ings from individual patients to draw conclusions about the organisation of other people’s cognitive systems or functional architecture. There is accumulating evidence against the universality assumption. Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2004) discovered substantial diferences between individuals in the location of brain networks involved in speech and lan- guage. Finn et al. (2015) found clear-cut diferences between individuals in functional connectivity across the brain, concluding that “An individual’s functional brain connectivity profle is both unique and reliable, similarly to a fngerprint” (p. 1669). Dufau (2017) reviewed interesting research conducted on patients during surgery for epilepsy or a tumour. Direct electrical stimulation, which causes “a genuine virtual transient lesion” (p. 305) is applied inva- sively to the cortex. The patient is awakened and given various cognitive tasks while receiving stimulation. Impaired performance when direct elec- trical stimulation is applied to a given area indicates that area is involved in the cognitive functions assessed by the current task. Findings obtained using direct electrical stimulation and other tech- niques (e.g., fMRI) led Dufau (2017) to propose a two-level model. At the cortical level, there is high variability across individuals in structure and function of any given brain areas. At the subcortical level (e.g., in pre- motor cortex), in contrast, there is very little variability across individuals. The fndings at the cortical level seem inconsistent with the universality assumption. The fourth assumption is subtractivity. The basic idea is that brain damage impairs one or more processing modules but does not change or add anything. The ffth assumption (related to subtractivity) is trans- parency (Shallice, 2015). According to the transparency assumption, the performance of a brain-damaged patient refects the operation of a theory designed to explain the performance of healthy individuals minus the impact of their lesion. Why are the subtractivity and transparency assumptions impor- tant? Suppose they are incorrect and brain-damaged patients develop new modules to compensate for their cognitive impairments. That would greatly complicate the task of learning about the intact cognitive system by studying brain-damaged patients. Consider pure alexia, a condition in which brain-damaged patients have severe reading problems but otherwise intact language abilities. These patients generally have a direct relationship between word length and reading speed due to letter-by-letter processing (Bormann et al., 2015). This indicates the use of a compensatory strategy difering markedly from the reading processes used by healthy adults. Research in cognitive neuropsychology How do cognitive neuropsychologists set about understanding the cognitive system? Of major importance is the search for dissociations, which occur when a patient has normal performance on one task (task X) but is impaired on a second one (task Y). For example, amnesic patients perform almost normally on short-term memory tasks but are greatly impaired on many KEY TERM Pure alexia Severe problems with reading but not other language skills; caused by damage to brain areas involved in visual processing.

It is tempting (but dangerous!) to conclude that the two tasks involve diferent processing modules and that the module(s) needed on long-term memory tasks have been damaged by brain injury. Why must we avoid drawing sweeping conclusions from dissociations? Patients may perform well on one task but poorly on a second one simply because the second task is more complex. Thus, dissociations may refect diferences in task complexity rather than the use of diferent modules. One apparent solution to the above problem is to fnd double disso- ciations. A double dissociation between two tasks (X and Y) is obtained when one patient performs normally on task X and is impaired on task Y but another patient shows the opposite pattern. We cannot explain double dissociations by arguing that one task is harder. For example, consider the double dissociation that amnesic patients have impaired long-term memory but intact short-term memory whereas other patients (e.g., KF discussed above) have the opposite pattern. This double dissociation strongly sug- gests there is an important distinction between short-term and long-term memory and that they involve diferent brain regions. The approach based on double dissociations has various limitations. First, it is generally based on the assumption that separate modules exist (which may be misguided). Second, double dissociations can often be explained in various ways and so provide only indirect evidence for sepa- rate modules underlying each task (Davies, 2010). For example, a double dissociation between tasks X and Y implies the cognitive system used on X is not identical to the one used on Y. Strictly speaking, the most we can generally conclude is that “Each of the two systems has at least one sub-system that the other doesn’t have” (Bergeron, 2016, p. 818). Third, it is hard to decide which of the very numerous double dissociations that have been discovered are theoretically important. Finally, we consider associations. An association occurs when a patient is impaired on tasks X and Y. Associations are sometimes taken as evidence for a syndrome (sets of symptoms or impairments often found together). However, there is a serious faw in the syndrome-based approach. An association may be found between tasks X and Y because the mechanisms on which they depend are adjacent anatomically in the brain rather than because they depend on the same underlying mechanism. Thus, the interpretation of associations is fraught with difculty. Single case studies vs case series For many years after the rise of cognitive neuropsychology in the 1970s, most cognitive neuropsychologists made extensive use of single-case studies. There were two main reasons. First, researchers can often gain access to only one patient having a given pattern of cognitive impair- ment. Second, it was often assumed every patient has a somewhat diferent pattern of cognitive impairment and so is unique. As a result, it would be misleading and uninformative to average the performance of several patients. In recent years, there has been a move towards the case-series study. Several patients with similar cognitive impairments are tested. After that, KEY TERMS Double dissociation The fnding that some brain-damaged individuals have intact performance on one task but poor performance on another task whereas other individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. Association The fnding that certain symptoms or performance impairments are consistently found together in numerous brain-damaged patients. Syndrome The notion that symptoms that often co-occur have a common origin.

The case-series approach is generally preferable to the single-case approach for various reasons (Lambon Ralph et al., 2011; Bartolomeo et al., 2017). First, it provides much richer data. With a case series, we can assess the extent of variation between patients rather than simply being concerned about the impairment (as in the single-case approach). Second, with a case series, we can identify (and then de-emphasise) the fndings from patients who are “outliers”. With the single-case approach, in con- trast, we do not know whether the one and only patient is representative of patients with that condition or is an outlier. Strengths Cognitive neuropsychology has several strengths. First, it has the advan- tage that it allows us to draw causal inferences about the relationship between brain areas and cognitive processes and behaviour. In other words, we can conclude (with moderate but not total confdence) that a given brain area is crucially involved in performing certain cognitive tasks (Genon et al., 2018). Second, as Shallice (2015, pp. 387–388) pointed out, “A key intel- lectual strength of neuropsychology . . . is its ability to provide evidence falsifying plausible cognitive theories.” Consider patients reading visually presented words and non-words aloud. We might imagine patients with damage to language areas would have problems in reading all words and non-words. However, some patients perform reasonably well when reading regular words (with predictable pronunciations) or non-words, but poorly when reading irregular words (words with unpredictable pro- nunciations). Other patients can read regular words but have problems with unfamiliar words and non-words. These fascinating patterns of impairment have transformed theories of reading (Coltheart, 2015; see Chapter 9). Third, cognitive neuropsychology “produces large-magnitude phenom- ena which can be initially theoretically highly counterintuitive” (Shallice, 2015, p. 405). For example, amnesic patients typically have severely impaired long-term memory for personal events and experiences but an essentially intact ability to acquire and retain motor skills (Chapter 7). These strong efects played a major role in memory researchers abandon- ing the notion of a single long-term memory system and replacing it with more complex theories. Fourth, in recent years, cognitive neuropsychology has increasingly been combined fruitfully with cognitive neuroscience. For example, cog- nitive neuroscience has revealed that a given brain injury or lesion often has widespread efects within the brain. This phenomenon is known as diaschisis: “the distant neurophysiological changes directly caused by a focal injury . . . these changes should correlate with behaviour” (Carrera & Tononi, 2014, p. 2410). Discovering the true extent of the brain areas adversely afected by a lesion facilitates the task of relating brain function- ing to cognitive processing and task performance.

First, the crucial assumption that the cognitive system is fundamentally modular is reasonable but too strong. There is less evidence for modularity among higher-level cognitive processes (e.g., consciousness; focused atten- tion) than among lower-level processes (e.g., colour processing; motion processing). If the modularity assumption is incorrect, this has implica- tions for the whole enterprise of cognitive neuropsychology (Patterson & Plaut, 2009). Second, other theoretical assumptions also seem too extreme. For example, evidence discussed earlier casts considerable doubts on the assumption of anatomical modularity and the universality assumption. Third, the common assumption that the task performance of patients provides relatively direct evidence concerning the impact of brain damage on previously intact cognitive systems is problematic. Brain-damaged patients often make use of compensatory strategies to reduce or eliminate the negative efects of brain damage on cognitive performance. We saw an example of such compensatory strategies earlier – patients with pure alexia manage to read words by using a letter-by-letter strategy rarely used by healthy individuals. Hartwigsen (2018) proposed a model to predict when compensatory processes will and will not be successful. According to this model, general processes (e.g., attention; cognitive control; error monitoring) can be used to compensate for the disruption of specifc processes (e.g., phonological processing) by brain injury. However, specifc processes cannot be used to compensate for the disruption of general processes. Hartwigsen discussed evidence supporting his model. Fourth, lesions can alter the organisation of the brain in several ways. Dramatic evidence for brain plasticity is discussed in Chapter 16. Patients whose entire left brain hemisphere was removed at an early age (known as hemispherectomy) often develop good language skills even though lan- guage is typically centred in the left hemisphere (Blackmon, 2016). There is the additional problem that a brain lesion can lead to changes in the functional connectivity between the area of the lesion and distant, intact brain areas (Bartolomeo et al., 2017). Thus, impaired cognitive per- formance following brain damage may refect widespread reduced brain connectivity as well as direct damage to a specifc brain area. This com- plicates the task of interpreting the fndings obtained from brain-damaged patients. COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE: THE BRAIN IN ACTION Cognitive neuroscience involves the intensive study of brain activity as well as behaviour. Alas, the brain is extremely complicated (to put it mildly!). It consists of 100 billion neurons connected in very complex ways. We must consider how the brain is organised and how the diferent areas are described to understand research involving functional neuroimaging. Below we discuss various ways of describing specifc brain areas. KEY TERMS Sulcus A groove or furrow in the surface of the brain. Gyrus Prominent elevated area or ridge on the brain’s surface; “gyri” is the plural. Dorsal Towards the top. Ventral Towards the bottom. Rostral Towards the front of the brain. Posterior Towards the back of the brain. Lateral Situated at the side of the brain. Medial Situated in the middle of the brain.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:24:37.\n\nApproaches to human cognition 13 First, the cerebral cortex is divided into four main divisions or lobes (see Figure 1.4). There are four lobes in each brain hemisphere: frontal; parietal; temporal; and occipital. The frontal lobes are divided from the parietal lobes by the central sulcus (sulcus means furrow or groove), and the lateral fssure sep- arates the temporal lobes from the parietal and frontal lobes. In addition, the parieto- occipital sulcus and pre-occipital notch divide the occipital lobes from the parietal and tem- poral lobes. The main gyri (or ridges; gyrus is the singular) within the cerebral cortex are shown in Figure 1.4. Researchers use various terms to describe accurately the brain area(s) activated during task performance: ● dorsal (or superior): towards the top ● ventral (or inferior): towards the bottom ● anterior (or rostral): towards the front ● posterior: towards the back ● lateral: situated at the side ● medial: situated in the middle. The German neurologist Korbinian Brodmann (1868–1918) produced a brain map based on diferences in the distributions of cell types across cortical layers (see Figure 1.5).

We will often refer to areas, for example, as BA17, which means Brodmann Area 17, rather than Brain Area 17! Within cognitive neuroscience, brain areas are often described with ref- erence to their main functions. For example, Brodmann Area 17 (BA17) is commonly called the primary visual cortex because it is strongly associated with the early processing of visual stimuli. Brain organisation In recent years, there has been considerable progress in identifying the connectome: this is a “wiring diagram” providing a complete map of the brain’s neural connections. Why is it important to identify the connectome? First, as we will see, it advances our understanding of how the brain is organised. Second, identifying the brain’s structural connections facilitates the task of understanding how it functions. More specifcally, the brain’s functioning is strongly constrained by its structural connections. Third, as we will see, we can understand some individual diferences in cognitive functioning with reference to individual diferences in the connectome. Bullmore and Sporns (2012) used information about the connectome to address issues about brain organisation. They argued two major prin- ciples might determine its organisation. First, there is the principle of cost control: costs (e.g., use of energy and space) would be minimised if the brain consisted of limited, short-distance connections (see Figure 1.6). Second, there is the principle of efciency (efciency is the ability to integrate infor- mation across the brain). This can be achieved by having very numerous connections, many of which are long-distance (see Figure 1.6). These two principles are in confict – you cannot have high efciency at low cost. You might imagine it would be best if our brains were organised pri- marily on the basis of efciency. However, this would be incredibly costly – if all 100 billion brain neurons were interconnected, the brain would need to be 12½ miles wide (Ward, 2015)! In fact, neurons mostly connect with nearby neurons and no neuron is connected to more than about 10,000 other neurons. As a result, the human brain has a near-optimal trade-of between cost and efciency (see Figure 1.6). Thus, our brains are reasona- bly efcient while incurring a manageable cost. Figure 1.6 The left panel shows a brain network low in cost effciency; the right panel shows a brain network high in cost effciency; the middle panel shows the actual human brain in which there is moderate effciency at moderate cost. Nodes are shown as orange circles. From Bullmore and Sporns (2012). Reprinted with permission of Nature Reviews.

This is an efcient organisation as can be seen by analogy to the world’s airports – the needs of passengers are best met by having numerous local airports (modules) and relatively few major hubs (e.g., Heathrow in London; Changi in Singapore; Los Angeles International Airport). Collin et al. (2014) argued the brain’s hubs are strongly interconnected and used the term “rich club” to refer to this state of afairs. The organ- isation of the rich club is shown in Figure 1.7: it includes the precuneus, the superior frontal cortex, insular cortex and superior parietal cortex. The fgure also shows connections between rich club nodes, connections between non-rich club nodes (local connections), and connections between rich club and non-rich club nodes (feeder connections). What light does a focus on brain network organisation shed on indi- vidual diferences in cognitive ability? Hilger et al. (2017) distinguished between global efciency (i.e., efciency of the overall brain network) and nodal efciency (i.e., efciency of specifc hubs or nodes). Intelligence was unrelated to global efciency. However, it was positively associated with the efciency of two hubs or nodes: the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The anterior insula is involved in the detection of task- relevant stimuli whereas the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is involved in performance monitoring. Techniques for studying brain activity: introduction Technological advances mean we have numerous exciting ways of obtaining detailed information about the brain’s functioning and structure. In princi- ple, we can work out where and when specifc cognitive processes occur in the brain. This allows us to determine the order in which diferent brain areas become active when someone performs a task. It also allows us to dis- cover the extent to which two tasks involve the same brain areas. Information concerning the main techniques for studying brain activity is contained in Table 1.2. Which technique is the best? There is no single (or simple) answer. Each technique has its own strengths and limitations, Figure 1.7 The organisation of the “rich club”. It includes the precuneus, the superior frontal cortex, insular cortex, and superior parietal cortex. The fgure also shows connections between rich club nodes, connections between non-rich club nodes (local connections), and connections between rich club and non-rich club nodes (feeder connections). фnorm rich club superior frontal insula superior parietal precuneus k <6 >14 non-rich club rich club feeder local 1.15 1.10 1.05 1.00 0.95 Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:24:37.","evidence":["nectome A comprehensive wiring diagram of neural connections within the brain.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:24:37."]}

Of key importance, these techniques vary in the precision with which they identify the brain areas active when a task is performed (spatial resolution) and the time course of such activation (temporal resolution). Thus, they difer in their ability to provide precise information concerning where and when brain activity occurs. TABLE 1.2 MAJOR TECHNIQUES USED TO STUDY THE BRAIN • Single-unit recording: This technique (also known as single-cell recording) involves inserting a micro-electrode 1/10,000th of a millimetre in diameter into the brain to study activity in single neurons. It is very sensitive: electrical charges of as little as one-millionth of a volt can be detected. • Event-related potentials (ERPs): The same stimulus (or very similar ones) are presented repeatedly, and the pattern of electrical brain activity recorded by several scalp electrodes is averaged to produce a single waveform. This technique allows us to work out the timing of various cognitive processes very precisely but its spatial resolution is poor. • Positron emission tomography (PET): This technique involves the detection of positrons (atomic particles emitted from some radioactive substances). PET has reasonable spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution and measures neural activity only indirectly. • Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): This technique involves imaging blood oxygenation using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine (described on p. 19). fMRI has superior spatial and temporal resolution to PET, but also provides an indirect measure of neural activity. • Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (efMRI): This “involves separating the elements of an experiment into discrete points in time, so that the cognitive processes (and associated brain responses) associated with each element can be analysed independently” (Huettel, 2012, p. 1152). Event-related fMRI is generally very informative and has become more popular recently. • Magneto-encephalography (MEG): This technique involves measuring the magnetic felds produced by electrical brain activity. It provides fairly detailed information at the millisecond level about the time course of cognitive processes, and its spatial resolution is reasonably good. • Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): This is a technique in which a coil is placed close to the participant’s head and a very brief pulse of current is run through it. This produces a short-lived magnetic feld that generally (but not always) inhibits processing in the brain area affected. When the pulse is repeated several times in rapid succession, we have repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is used very widely. It has often been argued that TMS or rTMS causes a very brief “lesion”. This technique has (jokingly!) been compared to hitting someone’s brain with a hammer. More accurately, TMS often causes interference because the brain area to which it is applied is involved in task processing as well as the activity resulting from the TMS stimulation. • Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): A weak electric current is passed through a given brain area for some time. The electric charge fows from a positive site (an anode) to a negative one (a cathode). Anodal tDCS increases cortical excitability and generally enhances performance. In contrast, cathodal tDCS decreases cortical excitability and mostly impairs performance.

From Ward (2006), adapted from Churchland & Sejnowski (1988). Techniques for studying the brain: detailed analysis We have introduced the main techniques for studying the brain. In what follows, we consider them in more detail. Single-unit recording The single-unit (or cell) recording technique is more fne-grain than any other technique (see Chapter 2). However, it is invasive and so rarely used with humans. An interesting exception is a study by Quiroga et al. (2005) on epileptic patients with implanted electrodes to identify the focus of seizure onset (see Chapter 3). A neuron in the medial temporal lobe responded strongly to pictures of Jennifer Aniston (the actor from Friends) but not to pictures of other famous people. We need to interpret this fnding care- fully. Only a tiny fraction of the neurons in that brain area were studied and it is highly improbable that none of the others would have responded to Jennifer Aniston. Event-related potentials Electroencephalography (EEG) is based on recordings of electrical brain activity measured at several locations on the surface of the scalp. Very small changes in electrical activity within the brain are picked up by scalp electrodes and can be seen on a computer screen. However, spontaneous or background brain activity can obscure the impact of stimulus processing on the EEG recording. The answer to the above problem is to present the same stimulus (or very similar stimuli) many times. After that, the segment of the EEG fol- lowing each stimulus is extracted and lined up with respect to the time of stimulus onset. These EEG segments are then averaged together to KEY TERMS Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) A technique in which magnetic pulses briefy disrupt the functioning of a given brain area. It is often claimed that it creates a short- lived “lesion”. More accurately, TMS causes interference when the brain area to which it is applied is involved in task processing as well as activity produced by the applied stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) A technique in which a very weak electrical current is passed through an area of the brain (often for several minutes); anodal tDCS often enhances performance, whereas cathodal tDCS often impairs it.

Juice Images/Alamy Stock Photo. produce a single waveform. This method produces event-related potentials from EEG recordings and allows us to distinguish the genuine efects of stimulation from background brain activity. ERPs have excellent temporal resolution, often indicating when a given process occurred to within a few milliseconds. The ERP waveform consists of a series of positive (P) and negative (N) peaks, each described with reference to the time in milliseconds after stimulus onset. Thus, for example, N400 is a negative wave peaking at about 400 ms. Behavioural measures (e.g., reaction times) typically provide only a single measure of time on each trial, whereas ERPs provide a continuous measure. However, ERPs do not indicate with precision which brain regions are most involved in processing, in part because skull and brain tissue distort the brain’s electrical felds. In addition, ERPs are mainly of value when stimuli are simple and the task involves basic processes (e.g., target detection) triggered by task stimuli. Finally, we cannot study the most complex forms of cognition (e.g., problem solving) with ERPs because the processes by participants would typically change with increased practice. Positron emission tomography (PET) Positron emission tomography (PET) is based on the detection of positrons – atomic particles emitted by some radioactive substances. Radioactively labelled water (the tracer) is injected into the body and rapidly gathers in the brain’s blood vessels. When part of the cortex becomes active, the labelled water moves there rapidly. A scanning device measures the positrons emitted from the radioactive water which leads to pictures of the activity levels in diferent brain regions. PET has reasonable spatial resolution in that any active brain area can be located to within 5–10 mm. However, it has very poor temporal resolution – PET scans indicate the amount of activity in any given brain region over approximately 30 seconds. As a consequence, PET has now largely been superseded by fMRI (see p. 19).

A strong magnetic feld causes an alignment of protons (subatomic particles) in the brain. A brief radio-frequency pulse is applied, which causes the aligned protons to spin and then regain their original orientations giving up a small amount of energy as they do so. The brightest regions in the MRI are those emitting the greatest energy. MRI scans can be obtained from numerous angles but tell us only about brain structure rather than its functions. Happily, MRI can also be used to provide functional information in the form of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Oxyhaemoglobin is converted into deoxyhaemoglobin when neurons consume oxygen, and deoxyhaemoglobin produces distortions in the local magnetic feld (sorry this is so complex!). This distortion is assessed by fMRI and provides a measure of the concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin in the blood. Technically, what is measured in fMRI is known as BOLD (blood oxygen-level-dependent contrast). Changes in the BOLD signal produced by increased neural activity take time, so the temporal resolution of fMRI is 2 or 3 seconds. However, its spatial resolution is very good (approxi- mately 1 mm). Thus, fMRI has superior temporal and spatial resolution to PET. Suppose we want to understand why people remember some items but not others. We can use event-related fMRI (efMRI), in which we consider KEY TERMS BOLD Blood oxygen-level- dependent contrast; this is the signal measured by fMRI. Neural decoding Using computer-based analyses of patterns of brain activity to work out which stimulus an individual is processing. CAN COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENTISTS READ OUR BRAINS/MINDS? There is much current interest in neural decoding – “determining what stimuli or mental states are represented by an observed pattern of neural activity” (Tong & Pratte, 2012, p. 483). This decoding involves complex computer-based analysis of individuals’ patterns of brain activity and has sometimes been described as “brain reading” or “mind reading”. Kay et al. (2008) obtained impressive fndings using neural decoding techniques. Two participants viewed 1,750 natural images and brain-activation patterns were obtained using fMRI. Computer- based approaches then analysed these patterns. After that, the participants were presented with 120 previously unseen natural images and fMRI data were collected. These fMRI data permitted correct identifcation of the image being viewed on 92% of the trials for one participant and 72% for the other. This is remarkable since chance performance was only 0.8%! Huth et al. (2016) used more complex stimuli. They presented observers with clips taken from several movies including Star Trek and Pink Panther 2 while using fMRI. Decoding accuracy was reasonably successful in identifying general object categories (e.g., animal), specifc object catego- ries (e.g., canine) and various actions (e.g., talk; run) presented in the movie clips. Research on neural decoding can enhance our understanding of human visual perception. However, successful decoding of an object using the pattern of brain activation in a given brain region does not necessarily mean that region is causally involved in observers’ identifcation of that object. Several reasons why we need to be cautious when interpreting fndings from neural decoding studies are discussed by Popov et al. (2018). For example, some aspects of brain activ- ity in response to visual stimuli are irrelevant to the observer’s perceptual representation. In an experiment, computer analysis of brain activity in macaques successfully classifed various stimuli presented to them that the macaques themselves could not distinguish (Hung et al., 2005).

(1998) recorded fMRI while participants learned a list of words. There was more brain activity during learning for words subsequently recognised than those subsequently forgotten. These fndings suggest forgotten words were processed less thoroughly than remembered words during learning. Evaluation fMRI is the dominant technique within cognitive neuroscience. Its value has increased over the years with the introduction of more powerful MRI scanners. Initially, most scanners had a feld strength of 1.5 T but recently scanners with feld strengths of up to 7 T have become availa- ble. As a result, submillimetre spatial resolution is now possible (Turner, 2016). What are fMRI’s limitations? The main ones are as follows: (1) It has relatively poor temporal resolution. As a result, it is unin- formative about the order in which diferent brain regions (and cog- nitive processes) are used during performance of a task. However, other techniques within cognitive neuroscience can be used in con- junction with fMRI in order to achieve good spatial and temporal resolution. (2) It provides an indirect measure of underlying neural activity. “The BOLD signal primarily measures the input and processing of neural information . . . but not the output signal transmitted to other brain regions” (Shiferman, 2015, p. 60). (3) Various complex processes are used by researchers to take account of the fact that all brains difer. This involves researchers changing the raw fMRI data and poses the danger that “BOLD-fMRI neuroimages represent mathematical constructs rather than physiological reality” (Shiferman, 2015). (4) There are important constraints on the visual stimuli that can be presented to participants when lying in the scanner and on the types of responses they can make. There can be particular problems with auditory stimuli because the scanner is noisy. Magneto-encephalography The electric currents that the brain generates are associated with a magnetic feld. This magnetic feld is assessed by magneto-encephalography (MEG) involving at least 200 devices on the scalp. This technique has very good spatial and temporal resolution. However, it is extremely expensive and this has limited its use. Transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique in which a coil (often in the shape of a fgure of eight) is placed close to the participant’s head.

This creates a short-lived magnetic feld generally leading to inhibited processing in the directly afected area (about 1 cc in extent). More specifcally, the magnetic feld created leads to electrical stimula- tion in the brain. In practice, several magnetic pulses are typically given in rapid succession – this is repet- itive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Most research has used rTMS but we will often simply use the more general term TMS. What is an appropriate control condition against which to compare the efects of TMS or rTMS? We could compare task performance with and without TMS. However, TMS creates a loud noise and muscle twitching at the side of the forehead and these efects might lead to impaired performance. Applying TMS to a non-critical brain area (irrelevant for task perfor- mance) often provides a suitable control condition. It is typically predicted task performance will be worse when TMS is applied to a critical area rather than a non-critical one because it produces a temporary “lesion” or interference to the area targeted. Evaluation What are TMS’s strengths? First, it permits causal inferences – if TMS applied to a particular brain area impairs task performance, we can infer that brain area is necessary for task performance. Conversely, if TMS has no efects on task performance, we can conclude the brain area afected by it is irrelevant. In that respect, it resembles cognitive neuropsychology. Second, TMS research is more fexible than cognitive neuropsychology. For example, we can compare any given individual’s performance with and without a “lesion” with TMS. This is rarely possible with brain-damaged patients. Third, TMS research is also more fexible than cognitive neuropsychol- ogy because the researcher controls the brain area(s) afected. In addition, the temporary “lesions” created by TMS typically cover a smaller brain area than patients’ lesions. This is important because the smaller the brain afected, the easier it generally is to interpret task-performance fndings. Fourth, with TMS research, we can ascertain when a brain area is most activated. For example, the presentation of a visual stimulus leads to processing proceeding rapidly to higher visual levels (feedforward pro- cessing). According to Lamme (2010), conscious visual perception typically requires subsequent recurrent processing proceeding in the opposite direc- tion from higher levels to lower ones. Koivisto et al. (2011) used TMS to disrupt recurrent processing. As predicted, this impaired conscious visual perception. What are the limitations of TMS research? First, the efects of TMS are complex and not fully understood. When TMS was frst introduced, it was assumed it would disrupt performance. That is, the most common fnding. However, Luber and Lisanby (2014) reviewed 61 studies in which performance speed and/or accuracy was enhanced! Transcranial magnetic stimulation coil.

It sometimes increases neural activity in areas adjacent to the one stimulated and so increases their pro- cessing efciency (Luber & Lisanby, 2014). There is also much evidence for compensatory fexibility (Hartwigsen, 2018) – disruption to cognitive processing within a given brain area caused by TMS is compensated for by the recruitment of other brain areas. Second, it is hard to establish the precise brain areas afected by TMS. For example, adverse efects of TMS on performance might occur because it interferes with communication between two brain areas at some dis- tance from the stimulation point. This issue can be addressed by combin- ing TMS with neuroimaging techniques to clarify its efects (Valero-Cabré et al., 2017). Third, TMS can only be applied to brain areas lying beneath the skull but with overlying muscle. That limits its overall usefulness. Fourth, there are safety issues with TMS. It has very occasionally caused seizures in participants despite stringent rules designed to ensure their safety. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) As mentioned earlier, anodal tDCS increases cortical excitability whereas cathodal tDCS decreases cortical excitability. The temporal and spatial res- olution of tDCS is less than TMS (Stagg & Nitsche, 2011). However, anodal tDCS has a signifcant advantage over TMS in that it often facilitates or enhances cognitive functioning. As a result, anodal tDCS is increasingly used to reduce adverse efects of brain damage on cognitive functioning (Stagg et al., 2018). Some of these benefcial efects on cognition are rela- tively long-lasting. Another advantage of tDCS is that it typically causes little or no discomfort. Much progress has been made in understanding the complex mecha- nisms associated with tDCS. However, “Knowledge about the physiologi- cal efects of tDCS is still not complete” (Stagg et al., 2018, p. 144). Overall strengths Cognitive neuroscience has contributed substantially to our understand- ing of human cognition. We discuss supporting evidence for that statement throughout the book in areas that include perception, attention, learning, memory, language comprehension, language production, problem solving, reasoning, decision-making and consciousness. Here we identify its major strengths. First, cognitive neuroscience has helped to resolve theoretical con- troversies and issues that had proved intractable with purely behavioural studies (Mather et al., 2013). The main reason is that cognitive neuroscience adds considerably to the information available to researchers (Poldrack & Yarkoni, 2016). Below we briefy consider two examples: (1) Listeners hearing degraded speech fnd it much more intelligible when it is accompanied by visually presented words matching (rather than not matching) the auditory input.

There has been much theoretical Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:24:37.\n\nApproaches to human cognition 23 controversy concerning when this visually presented information infu- ences speech perception (see Chapter 9). Does it occur early and so directly infuence basic auditory processes or does it occur late (after basic auditory processing has fnished)? Wild et al. (2012) found there was more activity in brain areas involved in early auditory processing when the visual input matched the auditory input. This strongly sug- gests visual information directly infuences basic auditory processes. (2) There has been much theoretical controversy as to whether visual imagery resembles visual perception (see Chapter 3). Behavioural evi- dence has proved inconclusive. However, neuroimaging has shown two-thirds of the brain areas activated during visual perception are also activated during visual imagery (Kosslyn, 2005). Even brain areas involved in the early stages of visual perception are often acti- vated during visual imagery tasks (Kosslyn & Thompson, 2003). Thus, there are important similarities. Functional neuroimaging has also revealed important diferences between the processes involved in visual perception and imagery (Dijkstra et al., 2017b). Second, the incredible richness of neuroimaging data means cognitive neu- roscientists can (at least in principle) construct theoretical models accurately mimicking the complexities of brain functioning. In contrast, cognitive neuropsychology, for example, is less fexible and more committed to the notion of a modular brain organisation. Third, over 10,000 fMRI studies within cognitive neuroscience have been published. Many meta-analyses based on these studies have been carried out to understand brain-cognition relationships (Poldrack & Yarkoni, 2016). Such meta-analyses “provide highly robust estimates of the neural correlates of relatively specifc cognitive tasks” (p. 592). At present, this approach is limited because we do not know the pattern of activation associated with any given cognitive process – data are coded with respect to particular tasks rather than underlying cognitive processes. Fourth, neuroimaging data can often be re-analysed based on the- oretical developments. For example, early neuroimaging research on face processing suggested it occurs mostly within the fusiform face area (see Chapter 3). However, the assumption that face processing involves a network of brain regions provides a more accurate account (Grill-Spector et al., 2017). Thus, cognitive neuroscience can be self- correcting. More generally, cognitive neuroscience has shown the assumption of functional specialisation (each brain area is specialised for a diferent func- tion) is oversimplifed. We can contrast the notions of functional special- isation and functional integration (positive correlations of various brain areas within a network). For example, conscious perception depends on coordinated activity across several brain regions and so involves functional integration (see Chapter 16). Overall limitations We turn now to general issues raised by cognitive neuroscience. We empha- sise fMRI research because that technique has been used most often. KEY TERM Functional specialisation The assumption that each brain area or region is specialised for a specifc function (e.g., colour processing; face processing).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:24:37.\n\n24 Approaches to human cognition First, many cognitive neuroscientists over-interpret their fndings by assum- ing one-to-one links between cognitive processes and brain areas. For example, activation in a particular small brain region (a “blob”) is inter- preted as being the “love area” and another small region was interpreted as being the “face processing area”. This approach has been described (unfat- teringly) as “blobology”. Blobology is in decline. However, there is still undue reliance on reverse inference – the involvement of a given cognitive process is inferred from activation within a given brain region. For example, face recognition is typically associated with activation within the fusiform face area, which led many researchers to identify that area as specifcally involved in face processing. This is incorrect in two ways (see Chapter 3): (1) the fusiform face area is activated in response to many diferent kinds of objects as well as faces (Downing et al., 2006); and (2) several other brain areas (e.g., occipital face area) are also activated during face processing. Second, cognitive neuroscience is rarely used to test cognitive theo- ries. For example, Tressoldi et al. (2012) reviewed 199 studies published in 8 journals. They found 89% of these studies focused on localising the brain areas associated with brain processes and only 11% tested a theory of cognition. There is some validity to Tressoldi et al.’s (2012) argument. However, it has become less persuasive because of the rapidly increasing emphasis within cognitive neuroscience on theory testing. Third, it is hard to bridge the divide between psychological processes and concepts and patterns of brain activation. As Harley (2012) pointed out, we may never fnd brain patterns corresponding closely to psycholog- ical processes such as “attention” or “planning”. Harley (2012, p. 1372) concluded as follows: “Our language and thought may not divide up in the way in which the brain implements these processes.” Fourth, it is sometimes hard to replicate fndings within cognitive neu- roscience. For example, Uttal (2012) compared the fndings from diferent brain-imaging meta-analyses on a given cognitive function. More specif- ically, he identifed the Brodmann areas associated with a given cogni- tive function in two meta-analyses. Uttal then worked out the Brodmann areas activated in both meta-analyses and divided this by the total number of Brodmann areas identifed in at least one meta-analysis. If the two meta-analyses were in total agreement, the resultant fgure would be 100%. The actual fgure varied between 14% and 51%! Uttal’s (2012) fndings seem devastating – after all, we might expect meta-analyses based on numerous studies to provide very reliable evi- dence. However, many apparent discrepancies occurred mainly because one meta-analysis reported activation in fewer brain areas than the other. This often happened because of stricter criteria for deciding a given brain area was activated (Klein, 2014). Fifth, false-positive fndings (i.e., mistakenly concluding that random activity in a given brain area is task-relevant) are common (Yarkoni et al., 2010; see discussion later on p. 25). There are several reasons for this. For example, researchers have numerous options when deciding precisely how to analyse their fMRI data (Poldrack et al., 2017). In addition, most neuroimaging studies produce huge amounts of data and researchers KEY TERM Reverse inference As applied to functional neuroimaging, it involves arguing backwards from a pattern of brain activation to the presence of a given cognitive process.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:24:37.\n\nApproaches to human cognition 25 sometimes fail to adjust required signifcance levels appropriately. Bennett et al. (2009) provided an example of a false-positive fnding. They asked their participant to determine the emotions shown in photographs. When they did not adjust required signifcance levels, there was signif- icant evidence of brain activation (see Figure 1.9). Amusingly, the participant was a dead salmon so we can be certain the “fnding” was a false positive. Sixth, most brain-imaging techniques reveal only associations between patterns of brain activation and behaviour. Such asso- ciations are purely correlational and do not establish the brain regions activated are nec- essary for task performance. For example, brain activation might also be caused by participants engaging in unnec- essary monitoring of their performance or attending to non-task stimuli. Seventh, many cognitive neuroscientists previously assumed most brain activity is driven by environmental or task demands. As a result, we might expect relatively large increases in brain activity in response to such demands. That is not the case. The increased brain activity when someone performs a cognitive task typically adds less than 5% to resting brain activ- ity. Surprisingly several brain areas exhibit decreased activity when a cog- nitive task is performed. Of importance here is the default mode network (Raichle, 2015). It consists of an interconnected set of brain regions (includ- ing the ventral medial and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, and the poste- rior cingulate cortex) more active during rest than during performance of a task. Its functions include mind wandering, worrying and daydreaming. The key point is that patterns of brain activity in response to any given cognitive task refect increased activity associated with task processing and decreased activity associated with reduced activity within the default mode network. Such complexities complicate the interpretation of neuroimaging data. Eighth, cognitive neuroscience shares with cognitive psychology problems of ecological validity (applicability to everyday life) and para- digm specifcity (fndings not generalising across paradigms). Indeed, the problem of ecological validity may be greater in cognitive neuroscience. For example, participants in fMRI studies lie on their backs in claustro- phobic and noisy conditions and have very restricted movement – not much like everyday life! Gutchess and Park (2006) found recognition memory was signifcantly worse in an MRI scanner than in an ordi- nary laboratory. Presumably the scanner provided a more distracting or anxiety-creating environment. Ninth, we must avoid what Ali et al. (2014) termed “neuroenchantment” – exaggerating the importance of neuroimaging to our understanding of cog- nition. Ali et al. provided a striking example of neuroenchantment. College students were exposed to a crudely built mock brain scanner (including a discarded hair dryer!) (see Figure 1.10). They were asked to think about Figure 1.9 Areas showing greater activation in a dead salmon when presented with photographs of people than when at rest. From Bennett et al. (2009).

COMPUTATIONAL COGNITIVE SCIENCE There is an important distinction between computational modelling and artifcial intelligence. Computational modelling involves programming computers to model or mimic human cognitive functioning. Thus, cogni- tive modellers “have the goal of understanding the human mind through computer simulation” (Taatgen et al., 2016, p. 1). In contrast, artifcial intelligence involves constructing computer systems producing intelligent outcomes but typically in ways diferent from humans. Consider Deep Blue, the IBM computer that defeated the world chess champion Garry Kasparov on 11 May 1997. Deep Blue processed up to 200 million positions per second, which is vastly more than human chess players (see Chapter 12). The IBM computer Watson also shows the power of artifcial intel- ligence. This computer competed on the American quiz show Jeopardy against two of the most successful human contestants ever on that show: Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. The competition took place between 14 and 16 February 2011, and Watson won the $1 million frst prize. Watson had the advantage over Rutter and Jennings of having access to 10 million documents (200 million pages of content). However, Watson had the disadvantage of being less sensitive to subtleties contained in the questions. In the past (and even nowadays), many experimental cognitive psycholo- gists expressed their theories in vague verbal statements (e.g., “Information KEY TERMS Computational modelling This involves constructing computer programs that simulate or mimic human cognitive processes.

This made it hard to provide precise predictions from the theory and to decide whether the evidence ftted the theory. As Murphy (2011) pointed out, verbal theories provided theorists with undesirable “wiggle room”. In con- trast, a computational model “requires the researchers to be explicit about a theory in a way that a verbal theory does not” (Murphy, 2011, p. 300). Implementing a theory as a program is a good way to check it contains no hidden assumptions or imprecise terms. This often reveals that the theory makes predictions the theorist had not realised! There are issues concerning the relationship between the performance of a computer program and human performance (Costello & Keane, 2000). For example, a program’s speed doing a simulated task can be afected by psychologically irrelevant features (e.g., the power of the computer). Nevertheless, the various materials presented to the program should result in diferences in program operation time correlating closely with diferences in participants’ reaction times with the same materials. Types of models Most computational models focus on specifc aspects of human cognition. For example, there are successful computational models providing accounts of reading words and non-words aloud (Coltheart et al., 2001; Perry et al., 2007, 2014; Plaut et al., 1996) (see Chapter 9). More ambitious computational models provide cognitive archi tectures – “models of the fxed structure of the mind” (Rosenbloom et al., 2017, p. 2). Approximately 300 cognitive architectures have been proposed over the years (Kotseruba & Tsotsos, 2018). Note that a cognitive architecture typically has to be supplemented with the knowledge required to perform a given task to produce a fully fedged computational model (Byrne, 2012). Anderson et al.

Nodes The basic units within a neural network model. Back-propagation A learning mechanism in connectionist models based on comparing actual responses to correct ones. especially infuential cognitive architecture in their Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) (discussed on p. 30). Connectionism Connectionist models (also called neural network models) typically consist of interconnected networks of simple units (or nodes) that exhibit learning. Connectionist or neural network models use elementary units or nodes connected together in structures or layers (see Figure 1.11). First, a layer of input nodes codes the input. Second, activation caused by input coding spreads to a layer of hidden nodes. Third, activation spreads to a layer of output nodes. Of major importance, the basic model shown in Figure 1.11 can learn simple additions. If input node 1 is active, output node 1 will also become active. If input nodes 1 and 2 are active, output node 3 will become active. If all input nodes are active, output node 10 will become active and so on. The model compares the actual output against the correct output. If there is a discrepancy, the model learns to adjust the weights of the connections between the nodes to produce the correct output. This is known as back- ward propagation of errors or back-propagation, and it allows the model to learn the appropriate responses without being explicitly programmed to do so. Numerous connectionist models have been constructed using the basic architecture shown in Figure 1.11. Recent connectionist models often have several hidden layers (they are called deep neural networks). Connectionist models involve distributed representations whereas other computational models involve localist representations (Bowers, 2017a). In the former case, each node or unit responds to multiple stimulus categories and so a given word or object is represented by the pattern of activation across many nodes or units. In the latter case, each node or unit responds most actively to a single meaningful stimulus category (e.g., a given word or object). Interest in the connectionist approach was triggered initially by Rumelhart et al. (1986) and McClelland et al. (1986) with their parallel distributed processing models. These models (like most models based on distributed representations) exhibit learning. Other infuential connectionist models are Plaut et al.’s (1996) reading model (Chapter 9) and McClelland & Elma’s (1986) TRACE model of spoken word recognition (Chapter 9). In contrast, computational models based on localist representations often do not exhibit learning because the representations contain all the required information. Examples of such models in this book include Coltheart et al.’s (2001) reading model (Chapter 9) and the speech production models of Dell (1986) and Levelt et al. (1999; see Chapter 11). It has often been assumed localist models are biologically implausible because they seem to imply a single neuron responds to stimuli Figure 1.11 Architecture of a basic three-layer connectionist network.

However, many neurons show considerable selec- tivity because they respond to only a very small fraction of stimuli. For example, consider a study by Quiroga et al. (2005) mentioned earlier. They presented epileptic patients with 100 images including famous individuals and landmark buildings. On average, responsive neurons responded to only approximately 3% of the images. The issues are complex. However, it is not clear localist models are less biologically plausible than distributed models (Bowers, 2017b). Evaluation There are many successful connectionist or neural network models (some are mentioned above). Such models (discussed at various points in this book) have provided valuable insights into human cognition and the models have become increasingly sophisticated over time. A general strength of neural networks is that they “exhibit robust fexibility in the face of the challenges posed by the real world” (Garson, 2016, p. 3). That is one reason why neural networks can perform numerous diferent kinds of cognitive tasks. Finally, there are intriguing similarities between the brain, with its numerous units (neurons) and synaptic connections, and neural networks, with their units (nodes) and connections. What are the limitations of connectionist models? First, there is an issue with the common assumption that connectionist models are distrib- uted. If two words are presented at the same time, this can lead to super- imposing two patterns over the same units or nodes making it hard (or impossible) to decide which activated units or nodes belong to which word. This causes superposition catastrophe (Bowers, 2017a). Second, there are many examples of neural networks that can make associations and match patterns. However, it has proved much harder to develop neural networks that can learn general rules (Garson, 2016). Third, the analogy between neural networks and the brain is very limited. In essence, the latter is hugely more complex than the former. Fourth, back-propagation implies learning will be slow, whereas humans sometimes exhibit one-trial learning (Garson, 2016). Furthermore, there is little or no evidence of back-propagation in the human brain (Mayor et al., 2014). Production systems Production systems consist of numerous “IF . . . THEN” production rules. Production rules can take many forms. However, an everyday example is: “If the green man is lit up, then cross the road.” There is also a working memory (i.e., a system holding information currently being processed). If information from the environment that “green man is lit up” reaches working memory, it will match the IF part of the rule in long-term memory and trigger the THEN part of the rule (i.e., cross the road). Production systems vary but generally have the following characteristics: ● numerous IF . . . THEN rules; ● a working memory containing information; KEY TERMS Production systems These consist of very large numbers of “IF . . . THEN” production rules and a working memory containing information. Production rules “IF . . .

Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) and beyond As mentioned earlier, Anderson et al. (2004) proposed ACT-R, which was subsequently developed (e.g., Anderson et al., 2008). ACT-R assumes the cognitive system consists of several modules (relatively independent subsys- tems). It combines computational cognitive science with cognitive neuro- science by identifying the brain regions associated with each module (see Figure 1.12). Four modules are of special importance: (1) Retrieval module: it maintains the retrieval cues needed to access information; its proposed location is the inferior ventrolateral pre- frontal cortex. (2) Imaginal module: it transforms problem representations to assist in problem solving; it is located in the posterior parietal cortex. (3) Goal module: it keeps tracks of an individual’s intentions and con- trols information processing; it is located in the anterior cingulate cortex. (4) Procedural module: it uses production (IF . . . THEN) rules to deter- mine what action will be taken next; it is located at the head of the caudate nucleus within the basal ganglia. Each module has a bufer associated with it containing a limited amount of important information. How is information from these bufers integrated? According to Anderson et al. (2004, p. 1058): “A central production system can detect patterns in these bufers and take co-ordinated action.” Figure 1.12 The main modules of the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) cognitive architecture with their locations within the brain.

ACT-R represents an impressive attempt to provide a theoretical framework for understanding information processing and performance on numerous cognitive tasks. It is also impressive in seeking to integrate com- putational cognitive science with cognitive neuroscience. What are ACT-R’s limitations? First, it is very hard to test such a wide-ranging theory. Second, areas of prefrontal cortex (e.g., dorsolat- eral prefrontal cortex) generally assumed to be of major importance in cognition are de-emphasised. Third, as discussed earlier, research within cognitive neuroscience increasingly reveals the importance to cognitive pro- cessing of brain networks rather than specifc regions. Fourth, in common with most other cognitive architectures, ACT-R has a knowledge base that is substantially smaller than that possessed by humans (Lieto et al., 2018). This reduces the applicability of ACT-R to human cognitive performance. Standard model of the mind Dozens of cognitive architectures have been proposed and it is difcult to compare them. Laird et al. (2017; see also Rosenbloom et al., 2017) recently proposed a standard model emphasising commonalities among major cogni- tive architectures including ACT-R (see Figure 1.13). Figure 1.13 may look unimpressive because it represents the model at a very general level. However, the model contains numerous additional assumptions (Laird et al., 2017). First, procedural memory has special importance because it has access to the whole of working memory; in con- trast, the other modules have access only to specifc aspects of working memory.

What happens is that: “Procedural memory induces the selection of a single deliberate act per cycle, which can modify working memory, initiate the retrieval of knowledge from long-term declar- ative memory, initiate motor actions . . ., and provide top-down infuence to perception” (Laird et al., 2017, p. 3). The cognitive cycle involves serial processing but parallel processing can occur within any module as well as between them. The standard model is useful but incomplete. For example, it does not distinguish between diferent types of declarative memory (e.g., episodic and semantic memory; see Chapter 7). In addition, it does not account for emotional infuences on cognitive processing. Links with other approaches ACT-R represents an impressive attempt to apply computational models to cognitive neuroscience. There has also been interest in applying such models to data from brain-damaged patients. Typically, the starting point is to develop a computational model accounting for the performance of healthy individuals on some task. After that, aspects of the computational model or program are altered to simulate “lesions”, and the efects on task perfor- mance are assessed. Finally, the lesioned model’s performance is compared against that of brain-damaged patients (Dell & Caramazza, 2008). Overall strengths Computational cognitive science has several strengths. First, the develop- ment of cognitive architectures can provide an overarching framework for understanding the cognitive system. This would be a valuable achievement given that much research in cognitive psychology is limited in scope and sufers from paradigm specifcity. Laird et al.’s (2017) standard model rep- resents an important step on the way to that achievement. Second, the scope of computational cognitive science has increased. Initially, it was applied mainly to behavioural data. More recently, however, it has been applied to functional neuroimaging data (e.g., Anderson et al., 2004) and EEG data (Anderson et al., 2016a). Why is this important? As Taatgen et al. (2016, p. 3) pointed out: “The link to neuroimaging is critical in establishing that the hypothesised processing steps in cognitive models have plausibility in reality.” Third, rigorous thinking is required to develop computational models because computer programs must contain detailed information about the processes involved in performing any given task. In contrast, many theo- ries within traditional cognitive psychology are vaguely expressed and the predictions following from their assumptions are unclear. Fourth, progress is increasingly made by using nested incremental mod- elling. In essence, a new model builds on the strengths of previous related models while eliminating (or reducing) their weaknesses and accounting for additional data. For example, Perry et al. (2007; Chapter 9) put forward a connectionist dual-process model (CDP+) of reading aloud that improved on the model on which it was based.

First, there is Bonini’s paradox: as models become more accu- rate and complete, they can become as hard to understand as the complex phenomena they are designed to explain. Conversely, models easy to under- stand are typically inaccurate and incomplete. Many computational mod- ellers have responded to this paradox by focusing on the essence of the phenomena and ignoring the minor details (Milkowski, 2016, p. 1459). Second, many computational models are hard to falsify. The ingenuity of computational modellers means many models can account for numerous behavioural fndings (Taatgen et al., 2016). This issue can be addressed by requiring computational models to explain neuroimaging fndings as well as behavioural ones. Third, some computational models are less successful than they appear. One reason is overftting in which a model accounts for noise in the data as well as genuine efects (Ziegler et al., 2010). Overftting often means a model seems to account very well for a given data set but is poor at pre- dicting new data (Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017). Fourth, most computational models ignore motivational and emo- tional factors. Norman (1980) distinguished between a cognitive system (the Pure Cognitive System) and a biological system (the Regulatory System). Computational cognitive science typically de-emphasises the Regulatory System even though it often strongly infuences the Pure Cognitive System. This issue can be addressed by developing computa- tional models indicating how emotions modulate cognitive processes (Rodriguez et al., 2016). Fifth, many computational models are very hard to understand (Taatgen et al., 2016). Why is this so? Addyman and French (2012, p. 332) identifed several reasons: Everyone still programs in [their] own favourite programming lan- guage, source code is rarely made available, . . . even for other mod- ellers, the profusion of source code in a multitude of programming languages, writing without programming guidelines, makes it almost impossible to access, check, explore, re-use or continue to develop [models]. Computational modellers often fail to share their source codes and models because they have perceived ownership over their own research and are concerned about losing control over it (Fecher et al., 2015). COMPARISONS OF MAJOR APPROACHES We have discussed the major approaches to human cognition at length and you may wonder which is the most useful and informative. However, that is not the best way of thinking about the issues for various reasons: (1) An increasing amount of research involves two or more diferent approaches.

Replication The ability to repeat a previous experiment and obtain the same (or similar) fndings. (2) Each approach makes its own distinctive contribution and so all are required. By analogy, it would be pointless asking whether a driver is more or less useful than a putter for a golfer – both are essential. (3) Each approach has its own limitations as well as strengths (see Table 1.2). The optimal solution in such circumstances is to use converging operations – several diferent research methods are used to address a given theoretical issue with the strengths of one method balancing out the limitations of other methods. If diferent methods produce the same answer, that provides stronger evidence than could be obtained using a single method. If diferent methods produce diferent answers, further research is required to clarify matters. Note that using conver- gent operations is more difcult and demanding than using a single approach (Brase, 2014). In writing this book, our coverage of each topic emphasises research most enhancing our understanding. As a result, any given approach (e.g., cogni- tive neuroscience; cognitive neuropsychology) is strongly represented when we discuss some topics but is much less well represented with other topics. IS THERE A REPLICATION CRISIS? Replication (the ability to repeat the fndings of previous research using the same or similar experimental methods) is of central importance to psychol- ogy (including cognitive psychology). In recent years, however, there have been concerns about the extent to which fndings can be replicated, leading Shrout and Rodgers (2018, p. 487) to refer to “the replication crisis” in psychology. An important trigger for these concerns was an infuential article in which the replicability of 100 studies published in leading psychology journals was assessed (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Only 36% of the fndings reported in these studies were replicated. Within cognitive psychology, only 21 out of 42 fndings (50%) were replicated. Only 50% of fndings were reproduced! This is perhaps less problem- atical than it sounds. The complexities of research mean individual studies can provide only an estimate of the “true” state of afairs rather than defnitive evidence (Stanley & Spence, 2014). Why are there problems with replicating fndings in cognitive psychol- ogy (and psychology generally)? A major reason is the sheer complexity of human cognition – cognitive processing and performance are infuenced by numerous factors (many of which are not controlled or manipulated). As a result, even replicated fndings often difer considerably in terms of the size of the efects obtained (Stanley et al., 2018). Another reason is that experimenters sometimes use questionable research practices exaggerating the true statistical signifcance of their data. One example is p-hacking (selective reporting), in which “Researchers conduct many analyses on the same data set and just report those that are statistically signifcant” (Simmons et al., 2018, p. 255). Another example involves researchers proposing hypotheses after research results are known rather than before as should be the case (Shrout & Rodgers, 2018).

One answer to problems with replicability is to use meta-analysis, in which fndings from many studies are combined and integrated using various statistical techniques. This approach has the advantage of not exaggerating the importance of any single study, but has various potential problems (Sharpe, 1997): (1) The “apples and oranges” problem: very diferent studies are often included within a meta-analysis. (2) The “fle drawer” problem: it is hard for researchers to publish non-signifcant fndings. Since meta-analyses often ignore unpublished fndings, the studies included may be unrepresentative. (3) The “garbage in – garbage out” problem: poorly designed and con- ducted studies are often included along with high-quality ones. The above problems can be addressed. Precise criteria for studies to be included can reduce the frst and third problems. The second problem can be reduced by asking researchers to provide relevant unpublished data. Watt and Kennedy (2017) identifed a more important problem: many researchers use somewhat subjective criteria for inclusion of studies in meta-analyses, favouring those supporting their theoretical position and rejecting those that do not. This creates confrmation bias (see Chapter 14). The good news is that experimental psychologists (including cogni- tive psychologists) have responded very positively to the above problems. More specifcally, there has been a large increase in disclosure and pre- registration. Disclosure means that researchers “disclose all of their meas- ures, manipulations, and exclusions” (Nelson et al., 2018, p. 518). In the case of meta-analyses, it means researchers making available all the fnd- ings initially considered for inclusion. That would allow other research- ers to conduct their own meta-analyses and check whether the outcome remains the same. Pre-registration involves researchers making publicly available all decisions about sample size, hypotheses, statistical analyses and so on before an experimental study is carried out. With respect to meta-analyses, pre- registration involves making public the inclusion criteria for a meta- analysis, the methods of analysis and so on, before the fndings of included studies are known (Hamlin, 2017). In sum, there are some genuine issues concerning the replicability of fndings within cognitive psychology. However, there are various reasons why there is no “replication crisis”. First, numerous important fndings in cognitive psychology have been replicated dozens or even hundreds of times as is clear from a very large number of meta-analytic reviews. Second, as Nelson et al. (2018, p. 511) pointed out: “The scientifc practices of experimental psychologists have improved dramatically.” OUTLINE OF THIS BOOK One problem with writing a textbook of cognitive psychology is that vir- tually all the processes and systems in the cognitive system are interde- pendent.

Visual perception is involved in the intake of information from the printed page, and there is attention to the content of the book. In order for the student to beneft from the book, they must possess considerable language skill, and must have extensive relevant knowledge stored in long-term memory. There may be an element of problem solving in the student’s attempts to relate the book’s content to the possibly con- ficting information they have learned elsewhere. Decision-making may also be involved when the student decides how much time to devote to each chapter. In addition, what the student learns depends on their emotional state. Finally, the acid test of whether the student’s learning has been efective comes during the examination itself, when the material from the book must be retrieved and consciously evaluated to decide its relevance to the examination question. The words italicised in the previous three paragraphs indicate major aspects of human cognition and form the basis of our coverage. In view of the interdependence of all aspects of the cognitive system, we empha- sise how each process (e.g., perception) depends on other processes and structures (e.g., attention, long-term memory). This should aid the task of understanding the complexities of human cognition. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. Cognitive psychology used to be unifed by an approach based on an analogy between the mind and the computer. This information-processing approach viewed the mind as a general-purpose, symbol-processing system of limited capacity. Today there are four main approaches to human cognition: experimental cognitive psychology; cognitive neuroscience; cognitive neuropsychology; and computational cognitive science. These four approaches are increasingly combined to provide an enriched understanding of human cognition. • Cognitive psychology. Cognitive psychology focuses on internal mental processes whereas behaviourism focused mostly on observable stimuli and responses. Cognitive psychologists assume top-down and bottom-up processes are both involved in the performance of cognitive tasks. These processes can be serial or parallel. Various methods (e.g., latent-variable analysis) have been used to address the task impurity problem and to identify the processes within cognitive tasks. Cognitive psychology has massively infuenced theorising and the tasks used across all major approaches to human cognition. In spite of its enormous contributions, cognitive psychology sometimes lacks ecological validity, suffers from paradigm specifcity and is theoretically vague. • Cognitive neuropsychology.

Double dissociations provide reasonable (limited) evidence for separate modules or systems. The case-study approach is more informative than the single-case approach. Cognitive neuropsychology is limited for several reasons: its assumptions are mostly too strong; patients can develop compensatory strategies, there is brain plasticity; brain damage can cause widespread reduced connectivity within the brain; and it underestimates the extent of integrated brain functioning. • Cognitive neuroscience: the brain in action. Cognitive neuroscientists study the brain as well as behaviour using techniques varying in spatial and temporal resolution. Functional neuroimaging techniques provide basically correlational evidence, but transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can indicate a given brain area is necessarily involved in a given cognitive function. The richness of the data obtained from neuroimaging studies permits the assessment of functional specialisation and brain integration. Cognitive neuroscience is a fexible and potentially self-correcting approach. However, correlational fndings are sometimes over- interpreted, underpowered studies make replication diffcult, and relatively few studies in cognitive neuroscience generate (or even test) cognitive theories. • Computational cognitive science. Computational cognitive scientists develop computational models to understand human cognition. Connectionist networks use elementary units or nodes connected together. They can learn using rules such as backward propagation. Production systems consist of production or “IF . . . THEN” rules. ACT-R is a highly developed model based on production systems. Computational models have increased in scope to provide detailed theoretical accounts of fndings from cognitive neuroscience and cognitive neuropsychology. They have shown progress via the use of nested incremental modelling. Computational models are often hard to falsify, de-emphasise motivational and emotional factors, and often lack biological plausibility. • Comparisons of different approaches. The major approaches are increasingly used in combination. Each approach has its own strengths and limitations, which makes it useful to use converging operations. When two approaches produce the same fndings, this is stronger evidence than can be obtained from a single approach on its own. If two approaches produce different fndings, this indicates further research is needed to clarify what is happening. • Is there a replication crisis? There is increasing evidence that many fndings in psychology (including cognitive psychology) are hard to replicate.

Basic processes in visual perception INTRODUCTION Considerable progress has been made in understanding visual percep- tion in recent years. Much of this progress is due to cognitive neuroscien- tists, thanks to whom we now have a good knowledge of the visual brain. Initially, we consider the main brain areas involved in vision and their func- tions. Then we discuss theories of brain systems in vision, followed by a detailed analysis of basic aspects of visual perception (e.g., colour percep- tion; depth perception). Finally, we consider whether perception can occur without conscious awareness. The specific processes we use in visual perception depend on what we are looking at and on our perceptual goals (i.e., what we are looking for) (Hegdé, 2008).

Observers saw pho- tographs containing (or not containing) an animal for only 20 ms. Event- related potentials (ERPs: see Glossary) indicated the presence of an animal was detected within about 150 ms. On the other hand, look at the photo- graph in Figure 2.1 and decide how many animals are present. It probably took you several seconds to perform this task. Bear in mind the diversity of visual perception as you read this and the following two chapters. VISION AND THE BRAIN In this section we consider the brain systems involved in visual perception. Visual processing occurs in at least 30 distinct brain areas (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). The visual cortex consists of the entire occipital cortex at the back of the brain and also extends well into the temporal and parietal lobes. To understand visual processing in the brain fully, however, we first need to consider briefly what happens between the eye and the cortex. From eye to cortex There are two types of visual receptor cells in the retina: cones and rods. Cones are used for colour vision and sharpness of vision (see section on colour vision, pp. 64–71). Patients with rod monochromatism have no detectable cone function resulting in total colour blindness (Tsano & Sharma, 2018). There are 125 million rods concentrated in the outer regions of the retina. Rods are specialised for vision in dim light. Many differences between cones and rods stem from the fact that a retinal ganglion cell receives input from only a few cones but from hundreds of rods. Thus, only rods produce much activity in retinal ganglion cells in poor lighting conditions. The main pathway between the eye and the cortex is the retina- geniculate-striate pathway. It transmits information from the retina to V1 and then V2 (both discussed shortly) via the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs) of the thalamus. The entire retina-geniculate-striate system is organised similarly to the retinal system. For example, two stimuli adja- cent to each other in the retinal image will also be adjacent at higher levels within that system. The technical term is retinopy: retinal receptor cells are mapped to points on the surface of the visual cortex. Each eye has its own optic nerve and the two optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm. At this point the axons from the outer halves of each retina proceed to the hemisphere on the brain hemisphere on the same side, whereas those from the inner halves cross over and go to the other hemisphere. As a result, each side of visual space is represented within the opposite brain hemisphere. Signals then proceed along two optic tracts within the brain. One tract contains signals from the left half of each eye and the other signals from the right half (see Figure 2.2). After the optic chiasm, the optic radiation proceeds to the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is part of the thalamus. Nerve impulses finally reach V1 in primary visual cortex within the occipital lobe at the back of the head before spreading out to nearby visual cortical areas such as V2. KEY TERMS Retinal ganglion cells Retinal cells providing the output signal from the retina. Retinopy The notion that there is mapping between receptor cells in the retina and points on the surface of the visual cortex.

(2) The magnocellular (or M) pathway: it is most sensitive to movement information; most of its input comes from rods. As stated above, these two pathways are only relatively independent. In fact, there are numerous interconnections between them and the entire visual system is extremely complex. For example, there is clear intermin- gling of the two pathways in V1 (Leopold, 2012). Ryu et al. (2018, p. 707) studied brain activity in V1 when random-dot images were presented: “The local V1 sites receiving those parallel inputs [from the P and M pathways] are densely linked with one another via horizontal connections [which] are organised in complicated yet systematic ways to subserve the multitude of representational functions of V1.” Finally, there is also a Koniocellular pathway. However, its functions are still not well understood. Early visual processing: V1 and V2 We start with three general points. First, to understand visual process- ing in the primary visual cortex (V1 or BA17) and the secondary visual cortex (V2 or BA18), we must consider the notion of a receptive field. The receptive field for any given neuron is the retinal region where light affects its activity. The receptive field can also refer to visual space because it is mapped in a one-to-one manner onto the retinal surface. Figure 2.2 Route of visual signals. Note that signals reaching the left visual cortex come from the left sides of the two retinas, and signals reaching the right visual cortex come from the right sides of the two retinas. KEY TERM Receptive field The region of the retina in which light influences the activity of a particular neuron.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.\n\n46 Visual perception and attention Second, neurons often influence each other. For example, there is lateral inhibition, where reduced activity in one neuron is caused by activ- ity in a neighbouring neuron. Lateral inhibition increases the contrast at the edges of objects, making it easier to identify the dividing line between objects. The phenomenon of simultaneous contrast depends on lateral inhi- bition (see Figure 2.3). The two central squares are physically identical but the one on the left appears lighter. This differ- ence is due to simultaneous contrast produced because the left surround is much darker than the right surround. Third, early visual processing involves large areas within the primary visual cortex (V1) and secondary visual cortex (V2). For example, Hegdé and Van Essen (2000) found in macaques that one-third of V2 cells responded to complex shapes and differences in size and orientation. Two pathways As we have just seen, neurons from the P and M pathways mainly project to V1 (primary visual cortex). What happens after V1? The P pathway associates with the ventral pathway or stream that proceeds to the inferotemporal cortex. In contrast, the M pathway associates with the dorsal pathway or stream that proceeds to the posterior parietal cortex. Note the above assertions oversimplify a complex reality. We discuss the ventral and dorsal pathways in detail shortly. It is assumed the ventral or “what” pathway culminating in the inferotempo- ral cortex is mainly concerned with form and colour processing and with object recognition. In contrast, the dorsal or “how” pathway culminating in the parietal cortex is more concerned with motion processing. As we will see later, there are extensive interactions between the two pathways. The nature of such interactions was reviewed by Rossetti et al. (2017; see Figure 2.15 in this chapter). Galletti and Fattori (2018) argued that visual processing is more flexible than implied by the notion of two interacting pathways or streams. We should not conceive the cortical streams as fixed series of intercon- nected cortical areas in which each area belongs to one stream . . ., but [rather] as interconnected neuronal networks, often involving the same neurons, that are involved in a number of functional processes and whose activation changes dynamically according to the context. (p. 203) Organisation of the visual brain A more detailed picture of the brain areas involved in visual process- ing is given in Figure 2.4. V3 is generally assumed to be involved in form KEY TERM Lateral inhibition Reduction of activity in one neuron caused by activity in a neighbouring neuron.

The ventral stream includes V1, V2, V3, V4 and the inferotemporal cortex, whereas the dorsal stream proceeds from V1 via V3 and MT (medial temporal cortex) to MST (medial superior tem- poral cortex). Figure 2.4 reveals three important points. First, there are complex interconnections among visual cortical areas. Second, the brain areas within the ventral pathway are more than twice as large as those within the dorsal pathway. Third, cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus respond fastest when a visual stimulus is presented followed by activation of cells in V1. However, cells are activated in several other areas (V3/V3A; MT; MST) very shortly thereafter. Figure 2.4 shows the traditional hierarchical view of the major brain areas involved in visual processing. It is supported by anatomical evi- dence (see proportions of fibres projecting up the hierarchy in the figure). Nevertheless, this view is oversimplified. Here we consider three of its main limitations. Figure 2.4 Some distinctive features of the largest visual cortical areas. The relative size of the boxes reflects the relative area of different regions. The arrows labelled with percentages show the proportion of fibres in each projection pathway. The vertical position of each box represents the response latency of cells in each area, as measured in single-unit recording studies.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.\n\n48 Visual perception and attention First, Kravitz et al. (2013) disagreed with the traditional view that the ventral pathway or stream involves a serial hierarchy pro- ceeding from simple to complex. Instead, he argued it consists of several overlapping recurrent networks (see Figure 2.5). There are connections in both directions between the components within these networks. As Hegdé (2018, p. 902) argued, “Various regions of the visual system process information not in a strict hierarchical manner but as parts of various dynamic brain-wide networks.” Second, there is an initial “feedfor- ward sweep” proceeding through the visual areas starting with V1 and then V2 (shown by the directional arrows in Figure 2.4). This is followed by recurrent or top-down processing proceeding in the opposite direc- tion (not shown in Figure 2.4). Several the- orists (e.g., Lamme, 2018; see Chapter 16) assume recurrent processing is of major importance for conscious visual perception because it integrates information across different visual areas. Note that visual imagery depends on several top-down processes resembling those used in visual perception (see Chapter 3). Hurme et al. (2017) obtained support for the above assumptions. They applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) to V1 at 60 ms to suppress feedforward processing and at 90 ms to suppress recurrent processing. As predicted, early V1 activity was necessary for conscious and unconscious vision but late V1 activity was necessary only for conscious vision. Third, Zeki (2016) distinguished three hierarchical models of the visual brain (see Figure 2.6). Model (a) was proposed first and model (c), the one favoured by Zeki, was proposed most recently. His central argument is that, “Parallel processing . . . is much more ubiquitous than commonly supposed” (p. 2515). Thus, models such as the one shown in Figure 2.4 are inadequate because they de-emphasise parallel processing. Functional specialisation Zeki (1993, 2001) proposed a functional specialisation theory where differ- ent cortical areas are specialised for different visual functions. The visual system resembles workers each working alone to solve part of a complex problem, and it is consistent with Zeki’s (2016) emphasis on parallel pro- cessing within the visual brain. The results of their labours are then com- bined to produce coherent visual perception. What are the advantages of functional specialisation? First, object attributes can occur in unpredictable combinations (Zeki, 2005). For example, a green object may be a car, a sheet of paper or a leaf, and a car can be red, black or green. Thus, we often need to process all of an Figure 2.5 Connectivity within the ventral pathway on the lateral surface of the macaque brain. Brain areas involved include V1, V2, V3 and V4, the middle temporal (MT)/medial superior temporal (MST) complex, the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the inferior temporal cortex (TE).

Second, the required processing differs considerably across attributes (Zeki, 2005). For example, motion processing involves integrating information across time whereas form or shape processing involves considering the spatial relationship of elements at a given moment. Here are the main functions Zeki ascribed to the brain areas shown in Figure 2.3: ● V1 and V2: They are involved at an early stage of visual processing. They contain different groups of cells responsive to colour and form. ● V3 and V3A: Cells in these areas respond to form (especially the shapes of objects in motion) but not colour. ● V4: The majority of cells in this area respond to colour; many are also responsive to line orientation.

In studies with macaque monkeys, Zeki found all the cells in this area responded to motion but not colour. In humans, the areas specialised for visual motion are referred to as MT and MST. Zeki assumed colour, motion and form are processed in anatomically sepa- rate visual areas. The relevant evidence is discussed below. Form processing Brain areas involved in form processing in humans include V1, V2, V3 and V4, culminating in the inferotemporal cortex (Kourtzi & Connor, 2011). Neurons in the inferotemporal cortex respond to specific semantic catego- ries (e.g., animals; body parts; see Chapter 3). Neurons in the inferotempo- ral cortex are also involved in form processing. Baldassi et al. (2013) found in monkeys that many neurons within the anterior inferotemporal cortex responded on the basis of form or shape (e.g., round; star-like; horizontally thin) rather than object category. Pavan et al. (2017) investigated the role of early visual areas in form processing using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; see Glossary) to disrupt processing. With static stimuli, rTMS delivered to early visual areas (V1/V2) disrupted form processing whereas rTMS deliv- ered to V5/MT did not. If form processing occurs in different brain areas from colour and motion processing, we might anticipate some patients would have severely impaired form processing but intact colour and motion processing. Some support was reported by Gilaie-Dotan (2016a). She studied LG, a man with visual form agnosia (see Glossary). LG had deficient functioning within V2 and V3 (although no obvious brain damage) associated with impaired form processing and object recognition, but relatively intact perception of colour and biological motion. However, such cases are very rare. As Zeki (1993) pointed out, brain damage sufficient to almost eliminate form per- ception would typically be so widespread that the patient would be blind. Colour processing The assumption that V4 (located within the ventral visual pathway) is spe- cialised for colour processing has been tested in several ways. These include studying brain-damaged patients, using brain-imaging techniques, and using transcranial magnetic stimulation to produce a temporary “lesion” (see pp. 20–22). If V4 is specialised for colour processing, patients with damage to that area should exhibit minimal colour perception with fairly intact form and motion perception and ability to see fine detail. This is approx- imately the case in achromatopsia (also known as cerebral achromatop- sia) although cases involving total achromatopsia are very rare (Zihl & Heywood, 2016). Bouvier and Engel (2006) found in a meta-analysis that a small brain area within the ventral (bottom) occipital cortex in (or close to) area V4 was damaged in nearly all cases of achromatopsia.

Lafer-Sousa et al. (2016) identified three brain areas in the ventral visual pathway responding more strongly to video clips of various objects presented in colour than in black-and-white. Of importance, different brain areas were associated with colour and shape processing: colour areas responded comparably to intact and scrambled objects. Bannert and Bartels (2018) studied brain activity in several brain areas (including V1, V2, V3 and V4) while participants viewed abstract colour stimuli or formed visual images of colour objects (e.g., tomato; banana). The colour of visually presented stimuli could be worked out from brain activity in every brain area studied, whereas the colour of imagined stimuli could only be worked out from brain activity in V4. These findings suggest that a network including several brain areas is involved in colour process- ing, but V4 is of special importance within that network. Finally, note that V4 is a relatively large area. As such, it is involved in the processing of texture, form and surfaces as well as colour (Winawer & Witthoft, 2015). Motion processing Area V5 (also known as motion processing area MT) is heavily involved in motion processing. Functional neuroimaging studies indicate that motion processing is associated with activity in V5/MT (Zeki, 2015). However, such studies cannot show V5 (or MT) is necessary for motion perception. More direct evidence was reported by McKeefry et al. (2008) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (see Glossary) to disrupt motion perception. TMS, applied to V5/MT, produced a subjective slowing of stimulus speed and impaired observers’ ability to discriminate between different speeds. Further evidence of the causal role of V5 in motion perception was obtained by Vetter et al. (2015). Observers could not predict the motion of a moving target when TMS was applied to V5. Additional evidence that the area V5/MT is important in motion pro- cessing comes from research on patients with akinetopsia. Akinetopsia is an exceptionally rare condition where stationary objects are perceived fairly normally but motion perception is grossly deficient (Ardila, 2016). Zihl et al. (1983) studied LM, a woman with akinetopsia who had suffered bilateral damage to the motion area (V5/MT). She could locate stationary objects by sight, had good colour discrimination and her binocular vision was normal. However, her motion perception was grossly deficient: She had difficulty . . . in pouring tea or coffee into a cup because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier. . . . In a room where more than two people were walking, . . . “people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving”. Zihl and Heywood (2015) discussed additional findings relating to LM. Even though her motion perception was extremely poor, she still retained limited ability to distinguish between moving and stationary stimuli. Heutink et al.

V5 (MT) is not the only brain area involved in motion processing. There is also the area MST just above V5/MT. Vaina (1998) studied two patients with damage to MST. Both patients had various problems relating to motion perception. One patient (RR) “frequently bumped into people, corners and things in his way, particularly into moving targets (e.g., people walking)” (Vaina, 1998, p. 498). These findings suggest MST is involved in the visual guidance of walking. Chaplin et al. (2018) found that the direc- tion of motion of a stimulus in healthy individuals could be inferred by taking account of activation within both MT and MST. The notions that motion perception depends almost exclusively on V5/MT and MST and that those areas only process information relating to motion are both oversimplifications for various reasons. First, several areas outside V5/MT and MST are involved in motion perception. For example, consider biological motion perception (see Chapter 4). Such per- ception involves several additional areas including the superior temporal sulcus, superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (Thompson & Parasuraman, 2012; Pavlova et al., 2017). Second, Heywood and Cowey (1999; see Figure 2.7) found that approx- imately 60% of cells within V5/MT respond to binocular disparity (differ- ence between the retinal images in the left and right eyes; see Glossary) and 50% of cells within V5/MT respond to stimulus orientation. However, V5/MT is especially important with respect to direction of motion with approximately 90% of cells responding. Third, we should distinguish between different types of motion percep- tion (e.g., first-order and second-order motion perception). With first-order Figure 2.7 The percentage of cells in six different visual cortical areas responding selectively to orientation, direction of motion, disparity and colour.

For example, the shape might be dark whereas the background is light. With second-order displays, there is no difference in luminance between the moving shape and the background. In everyday life, we encounter second-order displays infrequently (e.g., movement of grass in a field caused by the wind). Some patients have intact first-order motion perception but impaired second-order motion perception whereas others exhibit the opposite pattern (Gilaie- Dotan, 2016a). Thus, all forms of motion perception do not involve similar underlying processes. Gilaie-Dotan (2016b) studied motion processing within the brain (see Figure 2.8). In essence, information about visual motion inputs bypasses several visual areas (e.g., V2, V4) and rapidly reaches MT/V5. It then con- tinues rapidly to MST, after which information is transferred to several other areas. Gilaie-Dotan (2016b, p. 379) pointed out that visual motion perception “has been continually associated with and considered part of the dorsal pathway”. For example, Milner and Goodale’s (1995, 2008) perce ption- action model emphasises close links between visual motion processing and perception and the dorsal (“how” pathway; see pp. 56–57). Gilaie- Dotan accepted the dorsal pathway is of major importance. However, she argued persuasively that the ventral (“what”) pathway is also involved in motion perception. For example, efficient detection of visual motion Figure 2.8 Visual motion inputs proceed rapidly from subcortical areas and V1 directly to MT/V5 and from there to MST; information is then transferred to several other brain regions.

Binding problem Zeki’s theoretical approach poses the obvious problem of how informa- tion about an object’s motion, colour and form is combined and integrated to produce coherent perception. This is the binding problem: “How the brain brings together what it has processed . . . in its different hierarchically organised parallel processing systems . . . to give us our unitary experience of the visual world” (Zeki, 2016, p. 3521). One aspect of this problem is that object-related processing in different visual areas ends at different times, thus making it harder to integrate these outputs in visual perception. There may be continuous integration of information starting during early stages of visual processing. Seymour et al. (2009) presented observ- ers with red or green dots rotating clockwise or counterclockwise. Colour- motion conjunctions were processed in several brain areas including V1, V2, V3, V3A/B, V4 and V5/MT+. Seymour et al. (2016) found that binding of information about object form and colour occurred as early as V2. These findings contradict the traditional assumption that “The visual system initially extracts borders between objects and their background and then ‘fills in’ colour” (Seymour et al., 2016, p. 1997). Ghose and Ts’o (2017) reviewed research indicating progressively more integration of different kinds of information (and thus less functional spe- cialisation) during visual processing. They concluded: In V2, we see an increase in the overlap of cortical generated selectiv- ities such as orientation and colour . . . in V4 we see extensive overlap among colour, size, and form, and the existence of . . . a combination of colour and orientation . . . not present in earlier areas. (p. 17) So far we have focused on increases in integration of information as pro- cessing proceeds from early to late visual areas ( feedforward process- ing). However, conscious visual perception generally depends crucially on recurrent processing (feedback from higher to lower visual brain areas). Observers’ expectations influence recurrent processing and it is arguable that expectations (e.g., bananas will be yellow) facilitate the binding or inte- gration of different kinds of visual information. The binding-by-synchrony hypothesis (e.g., Singer & Gray, 1995) pro- vides an influential solution to the binding problem. According to this hypothesis, detectors responding to features of a single object fire in syn- chrony. Of relevance, widespread synchronisation of neural activity is asso- ciated with conscious visual awareness (e.g., Gaillard et al., 2009; Melloni et al., 2007; see Chapter 16). The synchrony hypothesis is oversimplified. There is the largely unre- solved issue of explaining why and how synchronised activity occurs across visual areas. The fact that visual object processing occurs in widely distrib- uted areas of the brain makes it implausible that precise synchrony could be achieved.

As Feldman (2013) pointed out, one problem is how visual features are bound together. Another problem is how we bind together information over successive eye movements to perceive a stable visual world. Within the above broader context, it is clear several lines of research are relevant. For example, observers must decide which parts of the visual information available at any given time belong to the same object. The gestaltists put forward several laws describing how this happens (see Chapter 3). Research on visual search (detecting target stimuli among dis- tractors) is also relevant (see Chapter 5). This research shows the important role of selective attention in combining features close together in time and space. Evaluation Zeki’s functional specialisation theory is an ambitious and influential attempt to provide a coherent theoretical framework. As discussed later, Zeki’s assumption that motion processing typically proceeds somewhat independently of other types of visual process has reasonable empirical support. What are the limitations with Zeki’s theoretical approach? First, the brain areas involved in visual processing are less specialised than implied theoretically. As mentioned earlier on p. 52, Heywood and Cowey (1999) considered the percentage of cells in each visual cortical area respond- ing selectively to various stimulus characteristics (see Figure 2.7). Cells in several areas responded to orientation, disparity and colour. Specialisation was found only with respect to responsiveness to direction of stimulus motion in MT. Second, the visual brain is substantially more complex than assumed by Zeki. There are far more brain areas devoted to visual processing than shown in Figure 2.3, and each brain area has connections to numerous other areas (Baker et al., 2018). For example, V1 is connected to at least 50 other areas! What is also de-emphasised in Zeki’s approach is the impor- tance of brain networks and the key role played by recurrent processing. Third, the binding problem (or problems) has not been solved. However, integrated visual perception undoubtedly depends on both bottom-up (feedforward) processes and top-down (recurrent) processes (see Chapter 3). TWO VISUAL SYSTEMS: PERCEPTION-ACTION MODEL What are the major functions of the visual system? Historically, the most popular answer was that it provides us with an internal (and conscious) rep- resentation of the external world. In contrast, Goodale and Milner (1992) and Milner and Goodale (1995, 2008) argued in their perception-action model, there are two visual systems each fulfilling a different function or purpose. First, there is the vision-for-perception (or “what”) system based on the ventral stream or pathway. It is used when we decide whether an object is a cat or a buffalo or when admiring a magnificent landscape. Thus, it is used to identify objects. KEY TERM Ventral stream The part of the visual processing system involved in object perception and recognition and the formation of perceptual representations.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.\n\n56 Visual perception and attention Second, there is the vision-for-action (or “how”) system based on the dorsal stream or pathway (see Figure 2.9) used for visually guided action. It is used when running to return a ball at tennis or when grasping an object. When we grasp an object, we must calculate its orientation and position with respect to ourselves. Since observers and objects often move relative to each other, orientation and position need to be worked out immediately prior to initiating a movement. Milner (2017, p. 1297) summarised key differences between the two systems: The ventral stream . . . mediates the transformations of the contents of the visual signal into the mental furniture that guides memory, rec- ognition and conscious perception. In contrast, the dorsal stream . . . mediates the visual guidance of action, primarily in real time. Schenk and McIntosh (2010) identified four major differences between the two processing streams: (1) The ventral stream underlies vision for perception whereas the dorsal stream underlies vision for action. (2) There is allocentric coding (object-centred; coding the locations of objects relative to each other) in the ventral stream but egocentric coding (body-centred; coding relative to the observer’s own body) in the dorsal stream. (3) Representations in the ventral stream are sustained over time whereas those in the dorsal stream are short-lasting. (4) Processing in the ventral stream generally (but not always) leads to conscious awareness, whereas processing in the dorsal stream does not. Two other differences have been suggested. First, processing in the dorsal stream is faster. Second, ventral stream processing depends more on input from the fovea (the central part of the retina used for detecting detail). Milner and Goodale originally implied that the dorsal and ventral streams were largely independent of each other. However, they have Figure 2.9 Goodale and Milner’s (1992) perception-action model showing the dorsal and ventral streams.

For example, Milner argued the influence of the ventral stream on dorsal stream process- ing “seems to carry visual and semantic complexity, thereby allowing us to bring meaning to our actions” (Milner, 2017, p. 1305). The key issue of the independence (or interdependence) of the two streams is discussed on pp. 62–63. Findings: brain-damaged patients We can test Milner and Goodale’s theory by studying brain-damaged patients. Patients with damage to the dorsal pathway should have reasona- bly intact vision for perception but severely impaired vision for action. The opposite pattern of intact vision for action but very poor vision for percep- tion should be found in patients having damage to the ventral pathway. Thus, there should be a double dissociation (see Glossary). Optic ataxia Patients with optic ataxia have damage to the posterior parietal cortex (forming part of the dorsal stream; see Figure 2.10). Some evidence suggests patients with optic ataxia are poor at making precise visually guided move- ments although their vision and ability to move their arms are reasonably intact. As predicted, Perenin and Vighetto (1988) found patients with optic ataxia had great difficulty in rotating their hands appropriately when reach- ing towards (and into) a large oriented slot. Patients with optic ataxia do not all conform to the simple picture described above. First, somewhat different regions of posterior parietal cortex are associated with reaching and grasping movements and some patients have greater problems with one type of movement than the other (Vesia & Crawford, 2012). Second, it is oversimplified to assume patients have intact visual per- ception but impaired visually guided action. Pisella et al. (2006) obtained much less evidence for impaired visually guided action in central compared to peripheral vision. This finding is consistent with evidence indicating many optic ataxics can drive effectively. Figure 2.10 Lesion overlap (purple = >40% overlap; orange = >60% overlap) in patients with optic ataxia.

Third, patients with optic ataxia have some impairment in vision for perception (especially in peripheral vision). Bartolo et al. (2018) found such patients had an impaired ability on the perceptual task of deciding whether a target was reachable and they also had problems on tasks requiring vision for action. Thus, patients with optic ataxia have difficulties in combining information from the dorsal and ventral streams. Fourth, Rossetti and Pisella (2018) concluded as follows from their review: “Optic ataxia is not a visuo-motor deficit and there is no dissoci- ation between perception and action capacities in optic ataxia” (p. 225). Visual form agnosia What about patients with damage only to the ventral stream? Of relevance are some patients with visual form agnosia, a condition involving severe problems with object recognition even though visual information reaches the visual cortex (see Chapter 3). The most-studied visual form agnosic is DF, whose brain damage is in the ventral stream (James et al., 2003). For example, her activation in that stream was no greater when presented with object drawings than with scrambled line drawings. However, she showed high levels of activation in the dorsal stream when grasping for objects. Goodale et al. (1994) found DF was very poor at a visual perception task that involved distinguishing between two shapes with irregular con- tours. However, she grasped these shapes firmly between her thumb and index finger. Goodale et al. concluded DF “had no difficulty in placing her fingers on appropriate opposition points during grasping” (p. 604). Himmelbach et al. (2012) re-analysed DF’s performance based on data in Goodale et al. (1994). DF’s performance was substantially inferior to that of healthy controls. Similar findings were obtained when DF’s perfor- mance on other grasping and reaching tasks was compared against con- trols. Thus, DF had greater difficulties with visually guided action than previously believed. Rossit et al. (2018) found DF had impaired peripheral (but not central) reaching, which is the pattern associated with optic ataxia. DF also had significant impairment in the fast control of reaching movements (also associated with optic ataxia). Rossit et al. (p. 15) concluded: “We can no longer assume that DF’s dorsal visual stream is intact and that she is spared in visuo-motor control tasks, as she also presents clear signs of optic ataxia.” Visual illusions There are numerous visual illusions, of which the Müller-Lyer (see Figure 2.11) is one of the most famous. The vertical line on the left looks longer than the one on the right although they are the same length. The Ebbinghaus illusion (see Figure 2.12) is also well known. The central circle surrounded by smaller circles looks smaller than a central circle of the same size surrounded by larger circles although the two central circles are the same size.

Milner and Goodale (1995) argued the vision-for-perception system processes visual illusions and provides visual judgements. In contrast, we mostly use the vision-for-action system when walking close to a precipice or dodging cars. These ideas led to a dramatic prediction: actions (e.g., pointing; grasping) using the vision-for-action system should be unaffected by most visual illusions. Findings Bruno et al. (2008) conducted a meta-analytic review of Müller-Lyer studies where observ- ers pointed rapidly at one figure (using the vision-for-action system). The mean illusion effect was 5.5%. In contrast, the mean illusion effect was 22.4% when observers provided verbal estimations of length (using the vision- for- perception system). The perception-action model is supported by this large difference. However, the model seems to predict there should have been no illusion effect at all with pointing. With the Ebbinghaus illusion, the illusion is often much stronger with visual judgements using the vision-for- perception system than with grasping movements using the vision-for-action system (Whitwell & Goodale, 2017). Knol et al. (2017) explored the Ebbinghaus illusion in more detail. As predicted theoretically, only visual judgements were influenced by the distance between the target and the context. Support for the perception-action model has been reported with the hollow-face illusion, a realistic hollow mask resembling a normal face (see Figure 2.13; visit the website: www.richardgregory.org/experiments). Króliczak et al. (2006) placed a target (a small magnet) on the face mask or a normal face. Here are two tasks they used: (1) Draw the target position (using the vision-for-perception system). (2) Make a fast, flicking finger movement to the target (using the vision- for-action system). There was a strong illusion effect when observers drew the target position, whereas their performance was very accurate (i.e., illusion-free) when they made a flicking movement. Both findings were as predicted theoretically. Króliczak et al. (2006) also had a third condition where observers made a slow pointing finger movement to the target and so the vision-for- action system was involved. However, there was a fairly strong illusory effect. Why was this? Actions may involve the vision-for-perception system Figure 2.12 The Ebbinghaus illusion.

Various problematical issues for the perception-action model have accumulated. First, the type of action is important. Franz and Gegenfurtner (2008) found the mean illusory effect with the Müller-Lyer was 11.2% with perceptual tasks, compared to 4.4% with full visual guidance of the hand movement. In contrast, grasping when observers could not monitor their hand movements was associated with an illusory effect of 9.4%, perhaps because action programming required the ventral stream. Second, illusion effects assessed by grasping movements often decrease with repeated practice (Kopiske et al., 2017). Kopiske et al. argued people use feedback from their inaccurate grasping movements on early trials to reduce illusion effects later on. Third, illusion effects are often greater when grasping or pointing move- ments are made following a delay (Hesse et al., 2016). The ventral stream (vision-for-perception) may be more likely to be involved after a delay. The various interpretive problems with previous research led Chen et al. (2018a) to use a different approach. In their key condition, observers had restricted vision (they viewed a sphere coated in luminescent paint in darkness through a pinhole). They estimated the sphere’s size by matching the distance between their thumb and forefinger to that size (perception) or they grasped the sphere (action). Their non-grasping hand was in their lap or directly below the sphere. In the latter condition, observers could make use of proprioception (awareness of the position of one’s body parts). Size judgements were very accurate in perception and action with full vision (see Figure 2.14). However, the key finding was that proprioceptive information about distance produced almost perfect performance when observers grasped the sphere but not when providing a perceptual estimate. These findings indicate a very clear difference in the processes underlying vision-for-perception and vision-for-action. In sum, there is some support for the predictions of the original vision-action model. However, illusory effects with visual judgements and with actions are more complex and depend on many more factors than KEY TERM Proprioception An individual’s awareness of the position and orientation of parts of their body.

Action planning + motor responses Milner and Goodale (2008) argued most tasks requiring observers to grasp an object involve some processing in the ventral stream in addition to the dorsal stream. They reviewed research showing that involvement of the ventral stream is especially likely in the fol- lowing circumstances: (1) Memory is required (e.g., there is a time lag between the offset of the stimulus and the start of the grasping movement). (2) Time is available to plan the forthcoming movement (e.g., Króliczak et al., 2006). (3) Planning which movement to make is necessary. (4) The action is unpractised or awkward. According to the perception-action model, actions are most likely to require the ventral stream when they involve conscious processes. Creem and Proffitt (2001) supported this notion. They started by distinguishing between effective and appropriate grasping. For example, we can grasp a toothbrush effectively by its bristles but appropriate grasping involves accessing stored knowledge about the object and so often requires the ventral stream. As predicted, appropriate grasping was much more adversely affected than effective grasping by disrupting participants’ ability to retrieve object knowledge. van Polanen and Davare (2015) reviewed research on factors con- trolling skilled grasping. They concluded: The ventral stream seems to be gradually more recruited as infor- mation about the object from pictorial cues or memory is needed to control the grasping movement, or if conceptual knowledge about more complex objects that are used every day or tools needs to be retrieved for allowing the most appropriate grasp. (p. 188) Dorsal stream: conscious awareness According to the two systems approach, ventral stream processing is gen- erally accessible to consciousness whereas dorsal stream processing is not. For example, it is assumed that the ventral stream (and conscious process- ing) are often involved in motor planning (Milner & Goodale, 2008). There is some support for these predictions from the model (Milner, 2012). As we will see, however, recent evidence mostly provides contrary evidence.

(2016) assessed the involvement of the dorsal and ventral streams in conscious visual perception using a different approach. The vis- ibility of visual targets presented to one eye was manipulated by varying the extent to which continuous flash suppression (rapidly changing stimuli presented to the other eye) impaired the processing of the targets. There were two main findings. First, there was a tight coupling between visual awareness of target stimuli and ventral stream processing. Second, there was a much looser coupling between target awareness and dorsal stream processing. The first finding is consistent with the two visual systems hypothesis. However, the second finding suggests dorsal process- ing is more relevant to conscious visual perception than assumed by that hypothesis. According to the perception-action model, manipulations (e.g., contin- uous flash suppression) preventing conscious perception should neverthe- less permit more processing in the dorsal than the ventral stream. However, neuroimaging studies have typically obtained no evidence that neural activ- ity in the dorsal stream is greater than in the ventral stream when observers lack conscious awareness of visual stimuli (Hesselmann et al., 2018). Two pathways: update The perception-action model was originally proposed before neuroimaging and other techniques had clearly indicated the great complexity of the brain networks involved in perception and action (de Haan et al., 2018). Recent research has led to developments of the perception-action model in two main ways. First, we now know much more about the various interactions between processing in the dorsal and ventral streams. Second, there are more than two visual processing streams. Rossetti et al. (2017) show how theoretical conceptualisations of the relationship between visual perception and action have become more complex (see Figure 2.15). We have seen that the ventral pathway is often involved in visually guided action. There is also increasing evidence the dorsal pathway is involved in visual object recognition (Freud et al., 2016). For example, patients with damage to the ventral pathway often retain some sensitivity to three-dimensional (3-D) structural object representations (Freud et al., 2017a). Zachariou et al. (2017) applied transcranial magnetic stimulation to posterior parietal cortex within the dorsal pathway to disrupt process- ing. TMS disrupted the holistic processing (see Glossary) of faces, suggest- ing the dorsal pathway is involved in face recognition. More supporting evidence was reported by Freud et al. (2016). They studied shape processing, which is of central importance in object recogni- tion and so should depend primarily on the ventral pathway. However, the ventral and dorsal pathways were both sensitive to shape. The observers’ ability to recognise objects correlated with the shape sensitivity of regions within the dorsal pathway. Thus, dorsal path activation was of direct rele- vance to shape and object processing. How many visual processing streams are there? There is evidence that actions towards objects depend on two partially separate dorsal streams (Sakreida et al., 2016; see Chapter 4). First, there is a dorso-dorsal stream (the “grasp” system) used to grasp objects rapidly. Second, there is a Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.","evidence":[") –0.4 Full Restricted Full Restricted noPro noPro withPro noPro noPro withPro Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.","62 Visual perception and attention Ludwig et al."]}

Haak and Beckmann (2018) investigated the connectivity patterns among 22 visual areas, discovering these areas “are organised into not two but three visual pathways: one dorsal, one lateral, and one ventral” (p. 82). Their findings thus provide some support for the emphasis within the perception-action model on dorsal and ventral streams.

It has received inconsistent support from research on patients with optic ataxia and visual agnosia. Earlier we dis- cussed achromatopsia (see Glossary) and akinetopsia (see Glossary). The former condition depends on damage to the ventral pathway and the latter condition on damage to the dorsal pathway (Haque et al., 2018). As pre- dicted theoretically, many visual illusions are much reduced in extent when observers engage in action-based performance (e.g., pointing; grasping). What are the model’s limitations? First, evidence from brain- damaged patients provides relatively weak support for it. In fact, “The idea of a double dissociation between optic ataxia and visual form agnosia, as cleanly separating visuo-motor from visual perceptual functions, is no longer tenable” (Rossetti et al., 2017, p. 130). Second, findings based on visual illusions provide only partial support for the model. The findings generally indicate that illusory effects are greater with perceptual judgements than actions but there are many exceptions. Third, the model exaggerates the independence of the two visual systems. For example, Janssen et al. (2018) reviewed research on 3-D object percep- tion and found strong effects of the dorsal stream on the ventral stream. As de Haan et al. indicated, The prevailing evidence suggests that cross-talk [interactions between visual systems] is the norm rather than the exception . . . [There is] a flexible and dynamic pattern of interaction between visual processing areas in which visually processing networks may be created on-the-fly in a highly task-specific manner. (de Haan et al., 2018, p. 6) Fourth, the notion there are only two visual processing streams is an over- simplification. Earlier on pp. 62–63 we discussed two attempts (Haak & Beckmann, 2018; Sakreida et al., 2016) to develop more complete accounts. COLOUR VISION Why do we have colour vision? After all, if you watch an old black-and- white movie on television you can easily understand the moving images. One reason is that colour often makes an object stand out from its sur- roundings making it easier to identify. Chameleons very sensibly change colour to blend in with the background, thus reducing their chances of being detected by predators. Colour perception also helps us to recognise and categorise objects. For example, it is useful when deciding whether a piece of fruit is under- or overripe. Predictive coding (processing primarily aspects of sensory input that violate the observer’s predictions) is also relevant (Huang & Rao, 2011). Colour vision allows observers to focus rapidly on any aspects of the incoming visual input (e.g., discolouring) discrepant with predictions based on ripe fruit. There are three main qualities associated with colour: (1) Hue: the colour itself and what distinguishes red from yellow or blue. (2) Brightness: the perceived intensity of light.

Trichromacy theory Retinal cones are specialised for colour vision. Cone receptors contain light-sensitive photopigment allowing them to respond to light. According to the trichromatic [three-coloured] theory, there are three kinds of receptors: (1) One type is especially sensitive to short-wavelength light and generally responds most strongly to stimuli perceived as blue. (2) A second type of cone receptor is most sensitive to medium-wavelength light and responds greatly to stimuli generally seen as yellow-green. (3) A third type of cone responds most to long-wavelength light such as that reflected from stimuli perceived as orange-red. How do we see other colours? According to the theory, most stimuli acti- vate two or all three cone types. The colour we perceive is determined by their relative stimulation levels. Evolution has equipped us with three types of cones because that produces a very efficient system – we can discriminate millions of colours even with so few cone types. Many forms of colour deficiency are consistent with trichromacy theory. Most individuals with colour deficiency have dichromacy, in which one cone class is missing. In red-green dichromacy (the most common form) there are abnormalities in the retinal pigments sensitive to medium or long wavelengths. Individuals with red-green dichromacy differ from intact observers in perceiving far fewer colours. However, their colour con- stancy (see Glossary) is almost at normal levels (Álvaro et al., 2017). The density of cones (the retinal cells responsible for colour vision) is far higher in the fovea (see Glossary) than the periphery. However, there are enough cones in the periphery to permit accurate peripheral colour judgements if colour patches are reasonably large (Rosenholtz, 2016). The crucial role of cones for colour vision explains the following common phenomenon: “The sunlit world appears in sparkling colour, but when night falls . . . we see the world in 50 shades of grey” (Kelber et al., 2017, p. 1). In dim light, the cones are not activated and our vision depends almost entirely on rods. Opponent-process theory Trichromacy theory does not explain what happens after activation of the cone receptors. It also fails to account for negative afterimages. If you stare at a square of a given colour for several seconds and then shift your gaze to a white surface, you see a negative afterimage in the complemen- tary colour (complementary colours produce white when combined). For example, a green square produces a red afterimage, whereas a blue square produces a yellow afterimage. Hering (1878) explained negative afterimages. He identified three types of opponent processes in the visual system. One opponent process (red- green channel) produces perception of green when responding one way and red when responding the opposite way. A second opponent process KEY TERMS Dichromacy A deficiency in colour vision in which one of the three cone classes is missing.

The third opponent process (achromatic channel) produces the per- ception of white at one extreme and black at the other. What is the value of these three opponent processes? The three dimen- sions associated with opponent processes provide maximally independent representations of colour information. As a result, opponent processes provide very efficient encoding of chromatic stimuli. Much research supports the notion of opponent processes. First, there is strong physiological evidence for the existence of opponent cells (Shevell & Martin, 2017). Second, the theory accounts for negative afterim- ages (discussed above). Third, the theory claims it is impossible to see blue and yellow together or red and green, but the other colour combinations can be seen. That is precisely what Abramov and Gordon (1994) found. Fourth, opponent processes explain some types of colour deficiency. Red- green deficiency occurs when the red-green channel cannot be used, and blue-yellow deficiency occurs when individuals cannot make effective use of the blue-yellow channel. Dual-process theory Hurvich and Jameson (1957) proposed a dual-process theory combining the ideas discussed so far. Signals from the three cones types identified by tri- chromacy theory are sent to the opponent cells (see Figure 2.16). There are three channels: (1) The achromatic [non-colour] channel combines the activity of the medium- and long-wavelength cones. (2) The blue-yellow channel represents the difference between the sum of the medium-and long-wavelength cones on the one hand and the short-wavelength cones on the other. The direction of difference determines whether blue or yellow is seen. Figure 2.16 Schematic diagram of the early stages of neural colour processing. Three cone classes (red = long; green = medium; blue = short) supply three “channels”. The achromatic (light-dark) channel receives non- spectrally opponent input from long- and medium- cone classes. The two chromatic channels receive spectrally opponent inputs to create the red-green and blue-yellow channels. 2009 George Mather. Reproduced with permission.

The direction of this dif- ference determines whether red or green is perceived. Overall evaluation Dual-process theory has much experimental support. However, it is oversimplified in several ways (Shevell & Martin, 2017). First, there are complex interactions between the channels. For example, short- wavelength cones are activated even in conditions where it would be expected that only the red-green channel (involving medium- and long-wavelength cones) would be active (Conway et al., 2018). Second, the proportions of different cone types vary considerably across individuals but this typically has surprisingly little effect on colour perception. Third, the arrangement of cone types in the eye is fairly random. This seems odd because it presumably makes it hard for colour-opponent processes to work effectively. More generally, much research has focused on colour perception and other research has focused on how nerve cells respond to light of different wavelengths. What has proved difficult is to relate these two sets of find- ings directly to each other. So far there is only limited convergence between psychological and physiological research (Shevell & Martin, 2017). Colour constancy Colour constancy is the tendency for a surface or object to be perceived as having the same colour when there are changes in the wave- lengths contained in the illuminant (the light source illuminating the surface or object). Colour constancy indicates colour vision does not depend solely on the wavelengths of the light reflected from objects. Learn more about colour constancy on YouTube: “This is Only Red by Vsauce”. Why is colour constancy important? If we lacked colour constancy, the apparent colour of familiar objects would change dramatically when the lighting conditions altered. This would make it very hard to recognise objects rapidly and accurately. Attaining reasonable levels of colour constancy is an impressive achievement. Look at the object in Figure 2.17. It is imme- diately recognisable as a blue mug even though several other colours can be per- ceived. The wavelengths of light depend on the mug itself, the illuminant and reflections from other objects onto the mug’s surface (mutual illumination).

(2009a) assessed colour constancy for six similarly coloured papers in various indoor and outdoor locations differing substantially in lighting con- ditions. They found 55% of the papers were identified correctly. This rep- resents good performance given the similarities among the papers and the large differences in lighting conditions. Reeves et al. (2008) distinguished between our subjective experience and our judgements about the world. For example, as you walk towards a fire, it feels increasingly hot subjectively. However, how hot you judge the fire to be is unlikely to change. Reeves et al. found colour constancy with non-naturalistic (artificial stimuli) was much greater when observers judged the objective similarity of two stimuli seen under different illumi- nants than when rating their subjective similarity. Radonjić and Brainard’s (2016) obtained similar findings with naturalistic stimuli. However, colour constancy was higher overall with naturalistic stimuli because such stimuli provided more cues to guide performance. Estimating scene illumination The wavelengths of light reflected from an object are greatly influenced by the illuminant (light source). High levels of colour constancy could be achieved if observers made accurate illuminant estimates. However, they often do not, especially when the illuminant’s characteristics are unclear (Foster, 2011). For example, there are substantial individual differences in the perceived illuminant (and perceived colour) of the famous dress dis- cussed in the Box. Colour constancy should be high when illuminant estimation is accu- rate (Brainard & Maloney, 2011). Bannert and Bartels (2017) tested this prediction. Observers were presented with visual scenes using three dif- ferent illuminants, and cues within the scenes were designed to facilitate colour constancy. Bannert and Bartels used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the neural encoding of each scene. What did Bannert and Bartels (2017) find? Their key finding was that, “The neural accuracy of encoding the illuminant of a scene [predicted] the behavioural accuracy of constant colour perception” (p. 357). Thus, colour constancy was high when the illuminant was processed accurately. Local colour contrast Land (1986) proposed retinex theory, according to which we perceive a surface’s colour by comparing its ability to reflect, short-, medium- and long-wavelength light against that of adjacent surfaces. Thus, we make use of local colour contrast. Kraft and Brainard (1999) studied colour con- stancy for complex visual scenes. Under full viewing conditions, colour constancy was 83% even with large changes in illumination. When local contrast could not be used, however, colour constancy dropped to 53%. Foster and Nascimento (1994) developed Land’s ideas into an influ- ential theory based on local contrast.

Suppose there are two illuminants and two surfaces. If surface 1 led to the long-wavelength or red cones respond- ing three times as much with illuminant 1 as illuminant 2, then the same threefold difference was also found with surface 2. Thus, the ratio of cone responses was essentially invariant across different illuminations. Thus, IN THE REAL WORLD: WHAT COLOUR IS “THE DRESS”? On 7 February 2015, Cecilia Bleasdale took a photograph of the dress she intended to wear at her daughter’s imminent wedding (see below) and posted it on the internet. It caused an almost immediate sensation because observers disagreed vehemently concerning the dress’s colour. What colour do you think the dress is (see Figure 2.18)? Wallisch (2017) found 59% of observers said the dress was white and gold and 27% said it was black and blue. How can we explain these individual differences? Wallisch argued the illumination of the dress is ambiguous: the upper part of the dress implies illumination by daylight whereas the lower part implies artificial illumination. Many theories predict the perceived colour of an object depends on its assumed illumination (dis- cussed on p. 62). If so, observers assuming the dress is illuminated by natural light should perceive it as white and gold. In contrast, those assuming artificial illumination should perceive it as black and blue. What did Wallisch (2017) find? As predicted, observers assuming the dress was illuminated by natural light were much more likely than those assuming artificial light to perceive the dress as white/gold (see Figure 2.19). Figure 2.18 “The Dress” made famous by its appearance on the internet. From Rabin et al. (2016).

Much evidence indicates cone-excitation ratios are important (Foster, 2011, 2018). For example, Nascimento et al. (2004) obtained evidence suggesting the level of colour constancy in different conditions could be predicted on the basis of cone-excitation ratios. Foster and Nascimento’s (1994) theory provides an elegant account of illuminant-independent colour constancy in simple visual environ- ments. However, it has limited value in complex visual environments. For example, colour constancy for a given object can become harder because of reflections from other objects (see Figure 2.17) or because multiple sources of illumination are present together. The theory is generally less applicable to natural scenes than artificial laboratory scenes. For example, the illuminant often changes more rapidly in natural scenes (e.g., clouds change shape, which influences the shadows they cast) (Nascimento et al., 2016). In addition, there are dramatic changes in the level and colour of natural illuminants over the course of the day. In sum, cone-excitation ratios are most likely to be almost invariant, “provided that sampling is from points close together in space or time . . ., or from points separated arbitrarily but undergoing even changes in illumination” (Nascimento et al., 2016, p. 44). Effects of familiarity Colour constancy is influenced by our knowledge of the familiar colours of objects (e.g., bananas are yellow). Hansen et al. (2006) asked observers to view photographs of fruits and to adjust their colour until they appeared grey. There was over-adjustment. For example, a banana still looked yel- lowish to observers when it was actually grey, leading them to adjust its colour to a slightly bluish hue. Such findings may reflect an influence of familiar size on subjective colour perception. Alternatively, familiar colour may primarily influence observers’ responses rather than their perception (e.g., our knowledge that bananas are yellow may bias us to report them as more yellow than they actually appear). Vandenbroucke et al. (2016) investigated the above issue. Observers viewed an ambiguous colour intermediate between red and green presented on typically red (e.g., tomato) or green (e.g., pine tree) objects. Familiar colour influenced colour perception. Of most importance, neural responses in various visual areas (e.g., V4, which is much involved in colour pro- cessing) were influenced by familiar colour. Neural responses corresponded more closely to those associated with red objects when the object was typi- cally red than when it was typically green and more closely to those found with green objects when it was typically green. Thus, familiar colour had a direct influence on perception early in visual processing. Chromatic adaptation One reason we have reasonable colour constancy is because of chromatic adaptation – an observer’s visual sensitivity to a given illuminant decreases over time.

However, this is not the case if you spend some time in a room illuminated by artificial light. Lee et al. (2012b) found some aspects of chromatic adaptation within six seconds. Such rapid adaptation increases colour constancy. Evaluation In view of the complexity of colour constancy, it is unsurprising the visual system adopts an “all hands on deck” approach in which several factors contribute to colour constancy. Of major importance are zone-excitation ratios that remain almost invariant across changes in illumination. In addition, top-down factors (e.g., our memory for the familiar colours of common objects) also play a role. What are the limitations of theory and research on colour constancy? First, we lack a comprehensive theory of how the various factors combine. Second, most research has focused on relatively simple artificial visual environments. In contrast, “The natural world is optically unconstrained. Surface properties may vary from one point to another, and reflected light may vary from one instant to the next” (Foster, 2018, p. B192). As a result, the processes involved in trying to achieve colour constancy in more complex environments are poorly understood. Third, more research is needed to understand why colour constancy depends greatly on the precise instructions given to observers. Fourth, as Webster (2016, p. 195) pointed out, “There are pronounced [individual] differences in almost all measures of colour appearance . . . the basis for these differences remains uncertain.” DEPTH PERCEPTION A major accomplishment of visual perception is the transformation of the two-dimensional retinal image into perception of a three-dimensional world seen in depth. The construction of 3-D representations is very important if we are to pick up objects, decide whether it is safe to cross the road and so on. Depth perception depends on numerous visual and other cues (dis- cussed below). All cues provide ambiguous information and so we would be ill-advised to place total reliance on any single cue. Moreover, different cues often provide conflicting information. When you watch a movie, some cues (e.g., stereo ones) indicate everything you see is at the same distance. In contrast, other cues (e.g., perspective; shading) indicate some objects are closer. In real life, depth cues are often provided by movement of the observer or objects in the visual environment and some cues are non-visual (e.g., object sounds). Here, however, the main focus will be on visual depth cues available when the observer and environmental objects are static. Cues to depth perception are monocular, binocular and oculomotor. Monocular cues require only one eye but can also be used with two eyes. The fact that the world still retains a sense of depth with one eye closed indicates clearly that monocular cues exist. Binocular cues involve both eyes used together. Finally, oculomotor cues depend on sensations of KEY TERMS Monocular cues Cues to depth that can be used by one eye but can also be used by both eyes together.

Monocular cues Monocular cues to depth are called pictorial cues because they are used by artists. Of particular importance is linear perspective, which artists use to create the impression of three-dimensional scenes on two-dimensional can- vases. Linear perspective (based on laws of optics and geometry) is based on various principles. For example, parallel lines pointing away from us converge (e.g., motorway edges) and objects reduce in size as they recede into the distance. Tyler (2015) argued that linear perspective is only really effective in creating a powerful 3-D effect when viewed from the point from which the artist constructed the perspective. This is typically very close to the picture as can be seen in a drawing by the Dutch artist Jan Vredeman de Vries (see Figure 2.20). Texture is another monocular cue. Most objects (e.g., carpets; cobble- stone roads) possess texture, and textured objects slanting away from us have a texture gradient (Gibson, 1979; see Figure 2.21). This is a gradient (rate of change) of texture density as you look from the front to the back of a slanting object with the gradient changing more rapidly for objects slanted steeply away from the observer. Sinai et al. (1998) found observers judged the distances of nearby objects better when the ground was uni- formly textured than when there was a gap (e.g., a ditch) in the texture pattern. Texture gradient is a limited cue because the perceived slant depends on the direction of the gradient. For reasons that are unclear, ground patterns are perceived as less slanted than equivalent ceiling or sidewall patterns (Higashiyama & Yamazaki, 2016).

The strength of this cue can be seen in Kanizsa’s (1976) illusory square (see Figure 2.22). There is a strong impression of a yellow square in front of four purple circles even though many of its contours are missing. This depends on pro- cesses that relatively “automatically” complete bound- aries using the available information (e.g., incomplete circles). Another useful cue is familiar size (discussed more fully later). If we know an object’s size, we can use its retinal image size to estimate its distance. However, we can be misled. Ittelson (1951) had observers view playing cards through a peephole restricting them to monocular vision. The perceived distance was determined almost entirely by familiar size. For example, playing cards double the usual size were perceived as being twice as far away from the observers than was actually the case. We turn now to blur. There is no blur at fixation point and it increases more rapidly at closer distances than ones further away. Held et al. (2012) found blur was an effective depth cue (especially at longer distances). However, observers may simply have learned to respond that the blurrier stimulus was further away. Langer and Siciliano (2015) provided minimal training and obtained little evidence blur was used as a depth cue. They argued blur provides ambiguous information: an object can appear blurred because it is in peripheral vision rather than because it is far away. Finally, there is motion parallax, which involves “transformations of the retinal image that are created . . . both when the observer moves (observer- produced parallax) and when objects move with respect to the observer (object-produced parallax)” (Rogers, 2016, p. 1267). For example, when you look out of the window of a moving train, nearby objects appear to move in the opposite direction but distant objects in the same direction. Rogers and Graham (1979) found motion parallax on its own can produce accurate depth judgements. Most research demonstrating the value of motion paral- lax as a depth cue has used very simple random-dot displays. However, Buckthought et al. (2017) found comparable effects in more complex and naturalistic conditions. Cues such as linear perspective, texture gradient and interposition allow observers to perceive depth even in two-dimensional displays. However, research with computer-generated two-dimensional displays has found depth is often underestimated (Domini et al., 2011). Such displays provide cues to flatness (e.g., binocular disparity, accommodation and vergence, all discussed on pp. 74–75) that may reduce the impact of cues suggesting depth.

It can also be achieved by binocular disparity, which is the slight dif- ference or disparity in the images projected on the retinas of the two eyes when you view a scene (Welchman, 2016). Binocular disparity produces stereopsis (the ability to perceive the world three-dimensionally). The great subjective advantage of binocular vision was described by Susan Barry (2009, pp. 94–132), a neuroscientist who recovered binocular vision in late adulthood: [I saw] palpable volume[s] of empty space . . . I could see, not just infer, the volume of space between tree limbs . . . the grape was rounder and more solid than any grape I had ever seen . . . Objects seemed more solid, vibrant, and real. Stereopsis is very powerful at short distances. However, the disparity or dis- crepancy in the retinal images of objects decreases by a factor of 100 as their distance from an observer increases from 2 to 20 metres. Thus, stere- opsis rapidly becomes less available at greater distances. While stereopsis provides valuable information at short distances, we must not exagger- ate its importance. Bülthoff et al. (1998) found observers’ recognition of familiar objects was not adversely affected when stereoscopic information was scrambled. Indeed, observers were unaware the depth information was scrambled! Stereopsis involves matching features in the inputs to the two eyes. This process is fallible. For example, consider an autostereogram (a two- dimensional image containing depth information so it appears three- dimensional when viewed appropriately; the Wikipedia entry for autostere- ogram provides examples). With autostereograms, the same repeating 2-D pattern is presented to each eye. If there is a dissociation of vergence and accommodation, two adjacent patterns will form an object apparently at a different depth from the background. Some individuals are better than others at perceiving 3-D objects in autostereograms because of individual differences in binocular disparity, vergence and accommodation (Gómez et al., 2012). The most common reason for impaired stereoscopic depth percep- tion is amblyopia (one eye exhibits poor visual acuity; also known as lazy eye). However, deficient stereoscopic depth perception can also result from damage to various cortical areas (Bridge, 2016). As Bridge concluded, intact stereoscopic depth perception requires the following: “(i) both eyes aligned and functional; (ii) control over the eye muscles and vergence to the images into alignment; (iii) initial matching of retinal images; and (iv) integration of disparity information” (p. 2). Oculomotor cues The pictorial cues discussed so far can all be used equally well by one- eyed individuals as by those with intact vision. Depth perception also depends on oculomotor cues based on perceiving muscle contractions KEY TERMS Binocular disparity A depth cue based on the slight disparity in the two retinal images when an observer views a scene; it is the basis for stereopsis.

One such cue is vergence (the eyes turn inwards to focus on very close objects than those further away). Another oculomotor cue is accommodation. It refers to the variation in optical power produced by the thickening of the eye’s lens when someone focuses on a close object. Vergence and accommodation are both very limited. First, they only provide information about the distance of a single object at any given time. Second, they are both of value only when judging the distance of close objects. Even then, the information they provide is not very accurate. Cue combination or integration So far we have considered depth cues one by one. In the real world, however, we typically have access to many depth cues. How do we use these cues? One possibility is additivity (combining or integrating information from all cues) and another possibility is selection (using information from only a single cue) (Bruno & Cutting, 1988). How could we maximise the accuracy of our depth perception? Jacobs (2002) argued we should assign more weight to reliable cues. Since cues reliable in one context may be less so in a different context, we should be flexible when assessing cue reliability. These considerations led Jacobs to propose two hypotheses: (1) Less ambiguous cues (i.e., those providing consistent information) are regarded as more reliable than more ambiguous ones. (2) A cue is regarded as reliable if inferences based on it are consistent with those based on other available cues. Other theoretical approaches resemble that of Jacobs (2002). For example, Rohde et al. (2016, p. 36) discuss Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which is “a rule used . . . to optimally combine redundant estimates of a varia- ble [e.g., object distance] by taking into consideration the reliability of each estimate and weighting them accordingly”. We can extend this approach to include prior knowledge (e.g., natural light typically comes from above; many familiar objects have a typical size). Finally, there are ideal-observer models (e.g., Landy et al., 2011; Jones, 2016). Many of these models are based on the Bayesian approach (see Chapter 13), in which initial probabilities are altered by new data or information (e.g., presentation of cues). Ideal-observer models involve making assumptions about the optimal way of combining the cue and other information available and comparing that against observers’ actual performance. As we will see, experimentation has benefitted from advances in virtual reality technologies. These advances permit researchers to control visual cues very precisely, thus permitting clear-cut tests of many hypotheses. Findings Evidence supporting Jacobs’ (2002) first hypothesis was reported by Triesch et al. (2002). Observers in a virtual reality situation tracked an object defined by colour, shape and size. On each trial, two attributes were unre- liable or inconsistent (their values changed frequently). Observers attached KEY TERMS Vergence A cue to depth based on the inward focus of the eyes with close objects.

Evidence supporting Jacobs’ (2002) second hypothesis was reported by Atkins et al. (2001). Observers in a virtual reality environment viewed and grasped elliptical cylinders. There were three cues to cylinder depth: texture, motion and haptic (relating to the sense of touch). When the haptic and texture cues indicated the same cylinder depth but the motion cue indicated a different depth, observers made increasing use of the texture cue and decreasing use of the motion cue. When the haptic and motion cues indicated the same cylinder depth but the texture cue did not, observers increasingly relied on the motion cue rather than the texture cue. Thus, whichever visual cue correlated with the haptic cue was preferred, and this preference increased with practice. Much research suggests observers integrate cue information according to the additivity notion: they take account of most (or all) cues but attach additional weight to more reliable ones (Landy et al., 2011). However, these conclusions are based primarily on studies involving only small conflicts in the information provided by each cue. What happens when two or more cues are in strong conflict? Observers typically rely heavily (or even exclusively) on only one cue, i.e., they use the selection strategy as defined by Bruno and Cutting (1988; see p. 75). This makes sense. Suppose one cue suggests an object is 10 metres away but another cue suggests it is 90 metres away. It is probably not sensible to split the difference and decide it is 50 metres away! We use the selection strategy at the movies – perspective and texture cues produce a 3-D effect, whereas we largely ignore cues (e.g., binocular disparity) indicating everything on the screen is the same distance from us. Relevant evidence was reported by Girshick and Banks (2009) in a study on slant perception. When there was a small conflict between the information provided by binocular disparity and texture gradient cues, observers used information from both. However, when there was a large conflict between these cues, perceived slant was determined exclusively by one cue (binocular disparity or texture gradient). Interestingly, the observers were not consciously aware of the large conflict between the cues. Do observers combine information from different cues to produce optimal performance (i.e., accurate depth perception)? Lovell et al. (2012) compared the effects of binocular disparity and shading on depth percep- tion. Overall, binocular disparity was the more informative cue to depth, but Lovell et al. tested the effects of making it less reliable. Information from the cues was combined optimally, with observers consistently attaching more weight to reliable cues. Many other studies have also reported that observers’ depth percep- tion is close to optimal. However, there are several studies where observers performed less impressively (Rahnev & Denison, 2018). For example, Chen and Tyler (2015) carried out a similar study to that of Lovell et al. (2012). Observers’ depth judgements were strongly influenced by shading but made very little use of binocular disparity information. KEY TERM Haptic Relating to the sense of touch.

Information from different depth cues is typically com- bined or integrated in studies assessing depth perception. There is also evi- dence that one cue often dominates the others when different cues conflict strongly. Overall, as Brenner and Smeets (2018, p. 385) concluded, “By com- bining the many sources of information in a clever manner people obtain quite reliable judgments that are not too sensitive to violations of the assumptions of the individual sources of depth information.” More spe- cifically, observers generally attach most weight to cues providing reliable information consistent with that provided by other cues. If a cue becomes more or less reliable over time, observers generally increase or decrease its weighting appropriately. Overall, depth perception often appears close to optimal. What are the limitations of theory and research on cue integration? First, we typically estimate distance in real-life settings where numerous cues are present and there are no large conflicts among them. In contrast, laboratory settings often provide only a few cues and these cues some- times provide very discrepant information. The unfamiliarity of laboratory settings may sometimes cause suboptimal performance by observers and reduce generalisation to everyday life (Landy et al., 2011). Second, the assumption that observers process several essentially independent cues before integrating all the information is dubious. It may apply when observers view a very limited and artificial visual display. However, natural environments typically provide observers with very rich information. In such environments, visual processing probably depends more on a global assessment of the overall structure of the environ- ment and less on processing of specific depth cues than usually assumed (Sedgwick & Gillam, 2017). There are also issues concerning the meaning of the word “cue”. For example, “Stereopsis is not a cue. It encompasses all the ways images of a scene differ in the two eyes” (Sedgwick & Gillam, 2017, p. 81). Third, ideal-observer models differ in the assumptions used to compute “ideal” performance and the meaning of “optimal” combining of cues in depth perception (Rahnev & Denison, 2018). Most models focus on the accuracy of depth-perception judgements. However, there are circum- stances (e.g., presence of a fierce wild animal) where rapid if somewhat inaccurate judgements are preferable. More generally, humans focus on “computational efficiency” – our goal is to maximise reward while min- imising the computational costs of visual processing (Summerfield & Li, 2018). Thus, optimality of depth-perception judgements does not depend solely on performance accuracy. Size constancy Size constancy is the tendency for any given object to appear the same size whether its size in the retinal image is large or small. For example, if KEY TERM Size constancy Objects are perceived to have a given size regardless of the size of the retinal image.

Why do we show size constancy? Many factors are involved. An object’s apparent distance is especially important when judging its size. For example, an object may be judged to be large even though its retinal image is very small provided it is far away. According to the size-distance invari- ance hypothesis (Kilpatrick & Ittelson, 1953), perceived size is proportional to perceived distance. Findings Haber and Levin (2001) argued that an object’s perceived size depends on memory of its familiar size as well as perceptual information concerning its distance. Initially, observers estimated the sizes of common objects with great accuracy from memory. Then they saw various objects at close (0–50 metres) or distant (50–100 metres) viewing range and made size judgements. Some familiar objects were almost invariant in size (e.g., bicycle) or of varying size (e.g., television set); there were also unfamiliar stimuli (e.g., ovals). What findings would we expect? If familiar size is important, size judge- ments should be more accurate for objects of invariant size than those of variable size, with size judgements least accurate for unfamiliar objects. If distance perception is all-important (and known to be more accurate for nearby objects), size judgements should be better for all object categories at close viewing range. Haber and Levin (2001) found that size judgements were much better with objects having an invariant size than those having a variable size (see Figure 2.23). In addition, the viewing distance had a minimal effect on size judgements. Both of these findings are contrary to predictions from the size-distance invariance hypothesis. If size judgements depend on perceived distance, size constancy should not be found when an object’s perceived distance differs considerably from Figure 2.23 Accuracy of size judgements as a function of object type (unfamiliar; familiar variable size; familiar invariant size) and viewing distance (0–50 metres vs 50–100 metres).

Nevertheless, the Ames room creates the same retinal image as a normal rectangular room when viewing monocularly through a peephole. The fact that one end of the rear wall is much further away from the viewer is disguised by making it much higher. The cues suggesting the rear wall is at right angles to observers are so strong they mistakenly assume two adults standing in the corners by the Figure 2.24 (a) A representation of the Ames room; (b) an actual Ames room showing the effect achieved with two adults.

They thus estimate the size of the nearer adult as much greater than that of the adult further away. See the Ames room on YouTube: “Ramachandran – Ames room illusion explained”. The illusion effect with the Ames room is so great someone walking backwards and forwards in front of the rear wall seems to grow and shrink as they move! Thus, perceived distance apparently determines perceived size. However, this effect is reduced when the person walking along the rear wall is a man and the observer is a female having a close emotional relationship with him. This is known as the Honi phenomenon because it was first experienced by a woman (whose nickname was Honi) when she saw her husband in the Ames room. Similarly dramatic findings were reported by Glennerster et al. (2006). Participants walked through a virtual-reality room as it expanded or con- tracted considerably. Even though they had detailed information from motion parallax and motion to indicate the room’s size was changing, no participants noticed the changes! There were large errors in participants’ judgements of the sizes of objects at longer distances because of their pow- erful expectation the size of the room would not alter. Some evidence discussed so far has been consistent with the assump- tion of the size-distance invariance hypothesis that perceived size depends on perceived distance. However, many other findings are inconsistent (Kim, 2017b). For example, Kim et al. (2016) obtained size and distance estimates from observers for objects placed in various tunnels. Size and distance were perceived independently (i.e., depended on different factors). In contrast, the size-distance invariance hypothesis predicts that perceived size and perceived distance should depend on each other and thus should not be independent. Kim (2018) obtained similar findings when observers viewed a virtual object presented stereoscopically. Their size judgements were more accu- rate than their distance judgements, with each judgement depending on its own information source. More evidence inconsistent with the size-distance invariance hypoth- esis was reported by Makovski (2017). Participants were presented with stimuli such as those shown in Figure 2.25 on a monitor. Even though per- ceived distance was the same for all stimuli, “open” objects (having missing boundaries) were perceived as much larger than “closed” objects (with all boundaries intact). This is the open-object illusion in which observers extend the missing boundaries. This may resemble our common perception that open windows make a room seem larger. Van der Hoort et al. (2011) found evidence for the body size effect, in which the size of a body mistakenly perceived to be one’s own influences the perceived sizes of objects. Participants equipped with head-mounted displays connected to CCTV cameras saw the environment from the perspective of a doll (see Figure 2.26). The doll was small or large. Van der Hoort et al. (2011) found objects were perceived as larger and further away when the doll was small than when it was large. These effects were greater when participants misperceived the body as their own (this was achieved by having the bodies of the participants and the doll KEY TERMS Honi phenomenon The typical apparent size changes when an individual walks along the rear wall of the Ames room are reduced when female observers view a man to whom they are very close emotionally.

Thus, size and distance perception depend partly on our lifelong experience of seeing everything from the perspective of our own body. Tajadura-Jiménez et al. (2018) ex- tended the above findings. Participants experienced having the body of a 4-year- old child or an adult with the body scaled down to match the height of the child’s body. Object size was overesti- mated more in the child-body condition, indicating that object size is influenced by higher-level cognitive processes (i.e., age perception). Evaluation Size perception and size constancy sometimes depend on perceived dis- tance. Some of the strongest evidence comes from research where misper- ceptions of distance (e.g., in the Ames room; in virtual environments) produce systematic distortions in perceived size. However, several other factors also influence size perception. These include familiar size, one’s perceived body size and whether objects do (or do not) contain missing boundaries. What are the limitations of research and theory on size perception? First, psychologists have discovered fewer sources of information account- ing for size perception than depth perception. In addition, as Kim (2017b, p. 2) pointed out, “The efficacy of the few information sources that have been identified for size perception is questionable.” Second, while the size-distance invariance hypothesis remains influential, there is a “vast lit- erature demonstrating independence of perceived size and distance” (Kim, 2018, p. 17). PERCEPTION WITHOUT AWARENESS: SUBLIMINAL PERCEPTION Can we perceive aspects of the visual world without any conscious aware- ness we are doing so? In other words, is there such a thing as subliminal perception (stimulus perception occurring even though the stimulus is below the threshold of conscious awareness)? Common sense suggests the answer is “No”. However, much research evidence suggests the answer is “Yes”. However, we must use terms carefully. A thermostat responds appropriately to temperature changes and so could be said to exhibit unconscious perception! Much important evidence has come from blindsight patients with damage to early visual cortex (V1), an area of crucial importance to Figure 2.25 Top: stimuli presented to participants; bottom: example of the stimulus display.

He was blind in the lower part of his left visual field as a result of surgery involving removal of part of his right primary visual cortex (BA17) to relieve his frequent severe migraine. DB was studied intensively by Larry Weiskrantz. DB is one of the most thoroughly studied blindsight patients (see Weiskrantz, 2010, for a his- torical review). He underwent surgical removal of the right occipital cortex, including most of the primary visual cortex, to relieve very severe migraine attacks. DB could detect the presence of an object and could indicate its approximate location by pointing. He could also discriminate between moving and stationary objects and could distinguish vertical from horizontal lines. However, DB’s abilities were limited – he could not distinguish between different-sized rectangles or between triangles having straight and curved sides. Such findings suggest DB processed only low-level fea- tures of visual stimuli and could not discriminate form. We have seen DB showed some ability to perform various visual tasks. However, he reported no conscious experience in his blind field. According to Weiskrantz et al. (1974, p. 721), “When he was shown a video film of his reaching and judging orientation of lines [by presenting it to his intact visual field], he was openly astonished.” Campion et al. (1983) pointed out that DB and other blindsight patients are only partially blind. They favoured the stray-light hypothesis, according to which patients respond to light reflected from the environment onto areas of the visual field still functioning. This hypothesis implies DB should have shown reasonable visual performance when objects were presented to his blind spot (the area where the optic nerve passes through the retina). However, DB could not detect objects presented to his blind spot. visual perception (discussed on pp. 45–46). Blindsight refers to patients’ ability to “detect, localise, and discriminate visual stimuli in their blind field, despite denying being able to see the stimuli” Mazzi et al. (2016, p. 1). In what follows, we initially consider blindsight patients. After that, we discuss evidence of subliminal perception in healthy individuals. Blindsight Many British soldiers in the First World War who had been blinded by gunshot wounds that destroyed their primary visual cortex (V1 or BA17) were treated by George Riddoch, a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. These soldiers responded to motion in those parts of the visual field in which they claimed to be blind. The apparently paradoxical nature of their condition was neatly captured by Weiskrantz et al. (1974), who coined the term “blindsight”. How is blindsight assessed? Various approaches have been taken but there are generally two measures. First, there is a forced-choice test in which patients guess (e.g., stimulus present or absent?) or point at stimuli they cannot see. Second, there are patients’ subjective reports that they cannot see stimuli presented to their blind region. Blindsight is typically defined by an absence of self-reported visual perception accompanied by above-chance performance on the forced-choice test.

Indeed, their visual abilities in their blind field are so poor that a seeing person with comparable impairment would be legally classified as blind. What do blindsight patients experience? It is surprisingly hard to decide exactly what blindsight patients experi- ence when presented with visual stimuli to their blind field. For example, the blindsight patient GY described his experiences as “similar to that of a normally sighted man who, with his eyes shut against sunlight, can perceive the direction of motion of a hand waved in front of him” (Beckers & Zeki, 1995, p. 56). On another occasion GY was asked about his qualia (sensory expe- riences). He said, “That [experience of qualia] only happens on very easy trials, when the stimulus is very bright. Actually, I’m not sure I really have qualia then” (Persaud & Lau, 2008, p. 1048). There is an important distinction between type-1 and type-2 blind- sight. Type-1 blindsight occurs when patients have no conscious awareness of visual stimuli presented to the blind field. In contrast, type-2 blind- sight occurs when patients have some residual awareness (although very different from that of healthy individuals). For example, a patient, EY, “sensed a definite pinpoint of light”, although “it looks like nothing at all” (Weiskrantz, 1980). Another patient, GY, said, “You don’t actually ever sense anything or see anything . . . it’s more an awareness but you don’t see it” (Weiskrantz, 1997). Many patients exhibit type-1 blindsight on some occasions but type-2 blindsight on others. Findings: evidence for blindsight Numerous studies have assessed the perceptual abilities of blindsight patients. Here we briefly consider three illustrative studies. As indicated already, blindsight patients often perform better when guessing an object’s direction of motion than its perceptual qualities (e.g., form; colour). For example, Chabanat et al. (2019) studied a blindsight patient, SA. He was correct 98% of the time when reporting an object’s direction of motion but performed at chance level when reporting its colour. GY (discussed earlier) is a much-studied blindsight patient. He has extensive damage to the primary visual cortex in the left hemisphere. In one study (Persaud & Cowey, 2008), GY was presented with a stimu- lus in the upper or lower part of his visual field. On inclusion trials, he was instructed to report the part of the visual field to which the stimu- lus had been presented. On exclusion trials, GY was instructed to report the opposite of its actual location (e.g., “up” when it was in the lower part). GY tended to respond with the real rather than the opposite loca- tion on exclusion and inclusion trials suggesting he had access to location information but lacked any conscious awareness of it (see Figure 2.27). In contrast, healthy individuals showed a large difference in performance on inclusion and exclusion trials indicating they had conscious access to location information.

However, GY indicated conscious awareness of far more stimuli in the intact field than the blind one (43% of trials vs 3%, respectively). GY had substantially more activa- tion in the prefrontal cortex and parietal areas to targets presented in the intact field suggesting those targets were processed much more thoroughly. Blindsight vs degraded conscious vision Some researchers argue blindsight patients exhibit degraded vision rather than a total absence of conscious awareness of “blind” field stimuli. For example, Overgaard et al. (2008) asked a blindsight patient, GR, to decide whether a triangle, circle or square had been presented to her blind field. In one experiment, GR simply responded “yes” or “no”. In another exper- iment, Overgaard et al. used a 4-point Perceptual Awareness Scale: “clear image”, “almost clear image”, “weak glimpse” and “not seen”. Using the yes/no measure, GR indicated she had not seen the stimu- lus on 79% of trials. However, she identified it correctly 46% of the time. These findings suggest the presence of type-1 blindsight. With the 4-point scale, in contrast, GR was correct 100% of the time when she had a clear image, 72% of the time when her image was almost clear, 25% when she had a weak glimpse and 0% when the stimulus was not seen. If the “clear image” and “almost clear image” data are combined, GR claimed aware- ness of the stimulus on 54% of trials, on 83% of which she was correct. Thus, the use of a sensitive method (the 4-point scale) suggested much of GR’s apparent blindsight reflected degraded conscious vision. Ko and Lau (2012) argued blindsight patients have more conscious visual experience than usually assumed. Their key assumption was as follows: “Blindsight patients may use an unusually conservative crite- rion for detection, which results in them saying ‘no’ nearly all the time to the question of ‘do you see something?’” (Ko & Lau, 2012, p. 1402). This excessive caution may occur in part because damage to the prefrontal cortex impairs their ability to set the criterion for visual detection appro- priately. Their excessive conservatism or caution may explain why the reported visual experience of blindsight patients is so discrepant from their forced-choice perceptual performance.

They also cited research supporting their assumption that blindsight patients often have prefrontal damage. Mazzi et al. (2016) carried out a study resembling that of Overgaard et al. (2008) on another blindsight patient, SL, showing no activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). SL decided which of two features (e.g., red or green colour) was present in a stimulus. When she indicated whether she had seen the stimulus or was merely guessing, her guessing performance was significantly above chance suggestive of type-1 blindsight. However, when she indicated her awareness using the 4-point Perceptual Awareness Scale, her visual performance was at chance level when she reported no awareness of the stimulus. These findings suggest an absence of blind- sight. The title of Mazzi et al.’s article provides the take-home message: “Different measures tell a different story” (p. 1). What can we conclude? Overgaard and Mogensen (2015, p. 37) argued that “rudimentarily analysed visual information is available in blindsight” but typically does not lead to conscious awareness. However, such infor- mation can produce conscious awareness if the patient uses much effort and top-down control. Two findings support this approach. First, blindsight patients gen- erally do not regard their experiences as “visual” because they differ so much from normal visual perception. Second, there is much evidence (Overgaard & Mogensen, 2015) that blindsight patients show enhanced visual performance (and sometimes subjective awareness) after training. This occurs because they make increasingly effective use of the rudimen- tary visual information available to them. Blindsight and the brain As indicated above, the main brain damage in blindsight patients is to V1 (the primary visual cortex). As we saw earlier on p. 47 in the chapter, visual processing typically proceeds from V1 (BA17) to other brain areas (e.g., V2, V3, V4; see Figure 2.4). Of importance, stimuli presented to the “blind” field often produce some activation in these other brain areas. However, this activation is not associated with visual awareness in blindsight patients. On p. 48 in the chapter we discussed research by Hurme et al. (2017) designed to clarify the role of V1 (the primary visual cortex) in the visual perception of healthy individuals. Transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the primary visual cortex to reduce its efficiency disrupted unconscious and conscious vision. In a similar study, Hurme et al. (2019) found TMS applied to V1 prevented conscious and unconscious motion perception in healthy individuals. In view of the above findings, how is it that many blindsight patients provide evidence of unconscious visual and motion processing? Part of the answer lies within the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, an inter- mediate relay station between the eye and V1 (see Figure 2.28). Ajina et al. (2015) divided patients with V1 damage into those with or without blind- sight. All those with blindsight had intact connections between LGN and Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.","evidence":["rinted from Persaud and Cowey (2008).","Reprinted with permission from Elsevier."]}

This finding is important given the crucial importance of MT/V5 for motion perception. Celeghin et al. (2019) reported a meta-analysis (see Glossary) providing a fuller account of the brain areas associated with patients’ visual process- ing. They identified 14 such areas. Some of these areas (e.g., the LGN; the pulvinar) are critical for non-conscious motion perception, whereas others (e.g., superior temporal gyrus; amygdala) are involved in non- conscious emotion processing. Overall, the meta-analysis strongly suggested that blindsight typically consists of several non-conscious visual abilities rather than one. Of interest, prefrontal areas (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) often associated with conscious visual perception (see Chapter 16) were not activated during visual processing by blindsight patients. These find- ings support the view that visual processing in these patients is typically unaccompanied by conscious experience. Finally, Celeghin et al. (2019) discussed evidence that there is substan- tial reorganisation of brain connectivity in many blindsight patients fol- lowing damage to V1 (primary visual cortex). For example, consider the blindsight patient, GY, whose left V1 was destroyed. He has nerve fibre connections between the undamaged right lateral geniculate nucleus and the contralesional (opposite side of the body) visual motion area MT/V5 (Bridge et al., 2008) – connections not present in healthy individuals. Such reorganisation helps to explain the visual abilities displayed by blindsight patients. Evaluation Much has been learned about the nature of blindsight. First, two main types of blindsight have been identified. Second, evidence for the existence Figure 2.28 The areas of most relevance to blindsight are the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and middle temporal visual area (MT/V5).

Third, brain connections important in blindsight (e.g., between the lateral geniculate nucleus and MT/V5) have been discovered. Fourth, the visual abilities of many blindsight patients probably depend on the reor- ganisation of connections within the brain following damage to the primary visual cortex. Fifth, the assumption that visual processing is rudimentary in blindsight patients explains many findings. Sixth, research on blindsight has shed light on the many visual pathways that bypass V1 but whose function- ing can be overshadowed by pathways involving V1 (Celeghin et al., 2019). What are the limitations of research in this area? First, there are con- siderable differences among blindsight patients with several apparently possessing some conscious visual awareness in their allegedly blind field. Second, many blindsight patients have more conscious visual experience in their “blind” field than appears from yes/no judgements about stimulus awareness. This probably happens because they are excessively cautious about claiming to have seen a stimulus (Mazzi et al., 2016; Overgaard et al., 2008). Third, the extent to which blindsight patients have degraded vision remains controversial. Fourth, the existence of reorganisation within the brain in blindsight patients (e.g., Bridge et al., 2008) may limit the applica- bility of findings from such patients to healthy individuals. Subliminal perception In research on subliminal perception in visually intact individuals, a perfor- mance measure of perception (e.g., enhanced speed or accuracy of respond- ing) is typically compared with an awareness measure. We can distinguish between subjective and objective measures of awareness: subjective meas- ures involve self-reports concerning observers’ awareness, whereas objective measures involve forced-choice responses (e.g., did the stimulus belong to category A or B?) (Hesselmann, 2013). As Shanks (2017, p. 752) argued, “Unconscious processing [subliminal perception] is inferred when above- chance performance is combined with null awareness.” For example, Naccache et al. (2002) had observers decide rapidly whether a visible target digit was smaller or larger than 5. Unknown to them, an invisible masked digit on the same side of 5 as the target (congru- ent) or the other side (incongruent) was presented immediately before the target. There were two main findings. First, responses to the target digits were faster on congruent than incongruent trials (performance measure). Second, no participants reported seeing any masked digits (subjective awareness measure) and their performance was at chance level when guess- ing whether masked digits were below or above 5 (objective awareness measure). These findings suggested the existence of subliminal perception. Findings Persaud and McLeod (2008) tested the notion that only information per- ceived with awareness can control our actions. They presented the letter “b” or “h” for 10 ms (short interval) or 15 ms (long interval). In the key condi- tion, participants were instructed to respond with the letter not presented.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.\n\n88 Visual perception and attention For example, if they were aware “b” had been presented, they would say “h”. The rationale was that only participants consciously aware of the letter could inhibit saying it. Persaud and McLeod (2008) found participants responded correctly with the non-presented letter on 83% of long-interval trials indicating rea- sonable conscious awareness. In contrast, participants responded correctly on only 43% of short-interval trials (significantly below chance) suggesting some stimulus processing but an absence of conscious awareness. An important issue is whether perceptual awareness is all-or-none (i.e., present or absent) or graded (i.e., varying in extent). Evidence suggesting it is graded was reported by Sandberg et al. (2010). One of four shapes was presented very briefly followed by masking. Observers made a behavioural response (deciding which shape had been presented) fol- lowed by one of three subjective measures: (1) clarity of perceptual expe- rience (the Perceptual Awareness Scale); (2) confidence in their decision; and (3) wagering variable amounts of money on having made the correct decision. What did Sandberg et al. (2010) find? First, above-chance task per- formance sometimes occurred without reported awareness with all three subjective measures. Second, the Perceptual Awareness Scale predicted per- formance better than the other measures, probably because it was the most sensitive measure of conscious experience. The partial awareness hypothesis (Kouider et al., 2010) potentially explains graded perceptual experience. According to this hypothesis, per- ceptual awareness can be limited to low-level features (e.g., colour) while excluding high-level features (e.g., face identity). Supportive evidence was reported by Gelbard-Sagiv et al. (2016) with faces coloured blue or green. They used continuous flash suppression (CFS): a stimulus presented to one eye cannot be seen consciously when rapidly changing patterns are pre- sented to the other eye. Observers often had conscious awareness of the colour of faces they could not identify. Koivisto and Grassini (2016) presented stimuli to one of four loca- tions. Observers then made a forced-choice responses concerning the stim- ulus location and rated their subjective visual awareness of the stimulus on a 3-point version of the Perceptual Awareness Scale (discussed above). Of central importance was the no-awareness category (i.e., “I did not see any stimulus”). The finding that observers were correct on 38% of trials associated with no awareness (chance performance = 25%) was apparent evidence for subliminal perception. However, there is an alternative explanation. According to Koivisto and Grassini (2016, p. 241), the above finding occurred mainly when “observers were very weakly aware of the stimulus, but behaved conservatively and claimed not having seen it”. This conservatism is known as response bias. Two findings supported this explanation. First, nearly all the observers showed response bias on no-awareness trials (see Figure 2.29). Second, Koivisto and Grassini (2016) used event-related potentials. The N200 (a negative wave 200 ms after stimulus presentation) is typi- cally substantially larger for stimuli associated with awareness.

In sum, Koivisto and Grassini (2016) provided a coherent explana- tion for the finding that visual performance was well above chance on no-awareness trials. Observers often had weak conscious awareness on correct no-awareness trials (indicated by the N200 findings). Such weak conscious awareness occurred most frequently among those most biased against claiming to have seen the stimulus. Neuroimaging research has consistently shown that stimuli of which the observers are unaware nevertheless produce activation in several brain areas. In one study (Rees, 2007), activation was assessed in brain areas associated with face processing and with object processing while invisible pictures of faces or houses were presented. The identity of the picture (face vs house) could be predicted with almost 90% accuracy from patterns of brain activation. Thus, subliminal stimuli can be processed reasonably thoroughly by the visual system. Research focusing on differences in brain activation between condi- tions where there is (or is not) conscious perceptual awareness is discussed thoroughly in Chapter 16. Here we will mention two major findings. First, there is much less integrated or synchronised brain activation when there is no conscious perceptual awareness (e.g., Godwin et al., 2015; Melloni et al., 2007). Second, activation of areas within the prefrontal cortex (involved in integrating brain activity) is much greater for consciously perceived visual stimuli than those not consciously perceived (e.g., Gaillard et al., 2009; Godwin et al., 2015). What do these findings mean? They strongly suggest processing is predominantly limited to low-level features (e.g., colour; motion) when stimuli are not consciously perceived, which is consistent with the partial awareness hypothesis (Kouider et al., 2010).

Some evidence is behavioural (e.g., Naccache et al., 2002; Persaud & McLeod, 2008) and some is based on pat- terns of brain activity (e.g., Melloni et al., 2007; Rees, 2007). The latter line of research suggests there can be considerable low-level processing of visual stimuli in the absence of conscious visual awareness. In spite of limitations of research in this area (see below), there is reasonably strong evidence for subliminal perception. What are the limitations of research on subliminal perception? First, measures of conscious awareness vary in sensitivity. As a consequence, it is relatively easy for researches to apparently demonstrate the existence of subliminal perception by using an insensitive measure (Rothkirch & Hesselmann, 2017). Second, many researchers focus on observers whose verbal reports show a lack of awareness. That would be appropriate if such reports were totally reliable. However, such reports are somewhat unreliable meaning that some of them would report awareness if they provided a second verbal report (Shanks, 2017). In addition, limitations of attention and memory may sometimes cause observers’ reports to omit some of their conscious experience from verbal reports (Lamme, 2010). Third, many claimed demonstrations of subliminal perception are flawed because of the typical failure to consider and/or control response bias (Peters et al., 2016). In essence, observers with response bias may claim to have no conscious awareness of visual stimuli when they actually have partial awareness (Koivisto and Grassini, 2016). Fourth, Breitmeyer (2015) identified 24 different methods used to make visual stimuli inaccessible to visual awareness. Neuroimaging and other techniques have been used to estimate the amount of unconscious process- ing associated with each method. Some methods (e.g., object-substitution masking: a visual stimulus is replaced by dots surrounding it) are associ- ated with much more unconscious processing than others (e.g., binocular rivalry, see Glossary). Of key relevance here, the likelihood of obtaining evidence for subliminal perception depends substantially on the method used to suppress visual awareness. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Vision and the brain. In the retina, there are cones (specialised for colour vision) and rods (specialised for motion detection). The retina-geniculate-striate pathway between the eye and cortex is divided into partially separate P and M pathways. The dorsal stream (associated with the M pathway) terminates in the parietal cortex and the ventral stream (associated with the P pathway) terminates in the inferotemporal cortex. There are numerous interactions between the two pathways and the two streams.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.\n\nBasic processes in visual perception 91 According to Zeki’s functional specialisation theory, different cortical areas are specialised for different visual functions (e.g., form; colour; motion). This is supported by findings from patients with selective visual deficits (e.g., achromatopsia; akinetopsia). However, much visual processing depends on large brain networks rather than specific areas and Zeki de-emphasised the importance of top-down (recurrent) processing. It remains unclear how we integrate the outputs of different visual processes (the binding problem). However, selective attention, synchronised neural activity and combining bottom-up (feedforward) processing and top-down (recurrent) processing all play a role. • Two visual systems: perception-action model. Milner and Goodale identified a vision-for-perception system based on the ventral stream and a vision-for-action system based on the dorsal stream. There is limited (and inconsistent) support for the predicted double dissociation between patients with optic ataxia (damage to the dorsal stream) and visual form agnosia (damage to the ventral stream). Illusory effects found when perceptual judgements are made (ventral stream) are often much reduced when grasping or pointing responses are used (dorsal stream). However, such findings are often hard to interpret, and visually guided action often relies more on the ventral stream than acknowledged theoretically. More generally, the two visual systems interact with each other much more than previously assumed and there are probably more than two visual pathways. • Colour vision. Colour vision helps us detect objects and make fine discriminations among them. According to dual-process theory, there are three types of cone receptors and three types of opponent processes (green-red; blue-yellow; white-black). This theory explains negative afterimages and colour deficiencies but is oversimplified. Colour constancy occurs when a surface’s perceived colour remains the same when the illuminant changes. Colour constancy is influenced by our ability to assess the illuminant accurately; local colour contrast; familiarity of object colour; chromatic adaptation; and cone-excitation ratios. Most theories are more applicable to colour vision with simple artificial stimuli than complex objects in the natural world. • Depth perception. There are numerous monocular cues to depth (e.g., linear perspective; texture; familiar size) plus oculomotor and binocular cues. Cues are sometimes combined additively in depth perception. However, more weight is generally given to reliable cues than unreliable ones with weightings changing if a cue’s reliability alters. However, one cue often dominates all others when different cues conflict strongly. It is often assumed that observers generally combine cues near-optimally, but it is hard to Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58.","evidence":["There are numerous interactions between the two pathways and the two streams.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:25:58."]}

The assumption that observers process several independent cues prior to integrating all the information is proba- bly wrong in natural environments providing rich information about overall environmental structure. Size perception is sometimes strongly influenced by perceived distance as predicted by the size-distance invariance hypothesis. However, the impact of familiar size on depth perception cannot be explained by that hypothesis. More generally, perceived size and perceived distance often depend on different factors. • Perception without awareness: subliminal perception. Patients with extensive damage to V1 sometimes suffer from blindsight. This is a condition involving some ability to respond to visual stimuli in the absence of normal conscious visual awareness (especially motion detection). There is no conscious awareness in type-1 blindsight but some residual awareness in type-2 blindsight. Blindsight patients are sometimes excessively cautious when reporting their conscious experience. The visual abilities of some blindsight patients probably depend on reorganisation of brain connections following brain damage. There is much behavioural and neuroimaging evidence for subliminal perception in visually intact individuals. However, there are problems of interpretation caused by insensitive (and unreliable) measures of self-reported awareness. Some observers may show apparent subliminal perception because they have a response bias leading them to claim no conscious awareness of visual stimuli of which they actually have limited awareness.

At this precise moment, you are looking at this book. If you raise your eyes, perhaps you can see a wall and windows. Object rec- ognition typically happens so effortlessly it is hard to believe it is actually a complex achievement. Evidence of its complexity comes from numerous unsuccessful attempts to program computers to “perceive” the environ- ment. However, computer programs that are reasonably effective at recog- nising complicated two-dimensional patterns have been developed. Why is visual perception so complex? First, objects often overlap and so we must decide where one object ends and the next one starts. Second, numerous objects (e.g., chairs; trees) vary enormously in their visual properties (e.g., colour; size; shape) and so it is hard to assign such diverse stimuli to the same category. Third, we recognise objects almost regardless of orientation (e.g., we can easily identify a plate that appears elliptical). We can go beyond simply identifying objects. For example, we can generally describe what an object would look like from different angles, and we also know its uses and functions. All in all, there is much more to object recognition than might be supposed (than meets the eye?). What is discussed in this chapter? The overarching theme is to unravel the mysteries associated with recognising three-dimensional objects. However, we initially discuss how two-dimensional patterns are recognised. Then the focus shifts to how we decide which parts of the visual world belong together and thus form separate objects. This is a crucial early stage in object recognition. After that, general theories of object recog- nition are evaluated against the available neuroimaging and behavioural evidence. Face recognition (vitally important in our everyday lives) differs in important ways from object recognition. Accordingly, we discuss face rec- ognition in a separate section. Finally, we consider whether the processes involved in visual imagery resemble those involved in visual perception.

PATTERN RECOGNITION We spend much of our time (e.g., when reading) engaged in pattern recognition – the identification or categorisation of two-dimensional patterns. Much research has considered how alphanumeric patterns (alpha- betical and numerical symbols) are recognised. A key issue is the flexibility of the human perceptual system (e.g., we can recognise the letter “A” rapidly and across wide variations in orientation, typeface, size and writing style). Patterns can be regarded as consisting of a set of specific features or attributes (Jain & Duin, 2004). For example, the key features of the letter “A” are two straight lines and a connecting cross-bar. An advantage of this feature-based approach is that visual stimuli varying greatly in size, orien- tation and minor details can be identified as instances of the same pattern. Many feature theories assume pattern recognition involves processing specific features followed by more global or general processing to inte- grate feature information. However, Navon (1977) argued global process- ing often precedes more specific processing. He presented observers with stimuli such as the one shown in Figure 3.1. On some trials, they decided whether the large letter was an “H” or an “S”; on others, they decided whether the small letters were Hs or Ss. Navon (1977) found performance speed with the small letters was greatly slowed when the large letter differed from the small letters. However, decision speed with the large letters was uninfluenced by the nature of the small letters. Navon concluded we often see the forest (global structure) before the trees (features). There are limitations with Navon’s (1977) research and conclusions. First, Dalrymple et al. (2009) found performance was faster at the level of the small letters than the large letter when the small letters were relatively large and spread out. Thus, attentional pro- cesses influence performance. Second, Navon failed to distinguish ade- quately between encoding (neuronal responses triggered by visual stimuli) and decoding (conscious perception of those stimuli) (Ding et al., 2017). Encoding typically progresses from lower-level representations of simple features to higher-level representations of more complex features (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). In contrast, Ding et al. (2017, p. E9115) found, “The brain prioritises de- coding of higher-level features because they are . . . more invariant and categorical, and thus easier to . . . maintain in noisy working memory.” Thus, Navon’s (1977) conclusions may be more applicable to visual decoding (conscious perception) than the preceding internal neuronal responses.

Hubel and Wiesel (1962) studied cells in parts of the occipital cortex involved in visual processing. Some cells responded in two different ways to a spot of light depending on which part of the cell was affected: (1) An “on” response with an increased rate of firing when the light was on. (2) An “off” response with the light causing a decreased rate of firing. Hubel and Wiesel (e.g., 1979) discovered two types of neuron in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells. Simple cells have “on” and “off” rectangular regions. These cells respond most to dark bars in a light field, light bars in a dark field, or straight edges between areas of light and dark. Any given cell responds strongly only to stimuli of a particular orien- tation and so its responses could be relevant to feature detection. Complex cells resemble simple cells in responding maximally to straight-line stimuli in a particular orientation. However, complex cells have large receptive fields and respond more to moving contours. Each complex cell is driven by several simple cells having the same orientation preference and closely overlapping receptive fields (Alonso & Martinez, 1998). There are also end-stopped cells. Their responsiveness depends on stimulus length and orientation. In sum, Hubel and Wiesel envisaged, “A hierarchically organised visual system in which more complex visual fea- tures are built (bottom-up) from more simple ones” (Ward, 2015, p. 111). Hubel and Wiesel’s account is limited in several ways: (1) The cells they identified provide ambiguous information because they respond comparably to different stimuli (e.g., a horizontal line moving rapidly and a nearly horizontal line moving slowly). Observers must combine information from numerous neurons to remove ambiguities. (2) Neurons differ in their responsiveness to different spatial frequencies and several phenomena in visual perception depend on this differen- tial responsiveness (discussed on pp. 104–105). (3) As Schulz et al. (2015, p. 1022) pointed out, “The responses of corti- cal neurons [in the primary visual cortex] to repeated presentations of a stimulus are highly variable.” This variability complicates pattern recognition. (4) Pattern recognition and object recognition depend on top-down processes triggered by expectations and context (e.g., Goolkasian & Woodberry, 2010; discussed on pp. 111–116) as well as on the bottom-up processes emphasised by Hubel and Wiesel.

Virtually everyone has received a substantial amount of spam (unwanted emails). Spammers use bots (robots running automated tasks over the internet) to send emails to thousands of individuals for various money-making purposes (e.g., fake sweepstake entries). A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is commonly used to discourage spammers. The intention is to ensure a website user is human by providing a test humans can solve but automated computer-based systems cannot. The CAPTCHA in Figure 3.2 is typical in consisting of distorted characters connected together horizontally. In principle, the study of CAPTCHAs can shed light on the strengths of human pattern recognition. Computer programs to solve CAPTCHAs generally involve a segmentation phase to locate the characters followed by a rec- ognition phase where each character is identified. Many computer programs can recognise individual characters even when very distorted but their performance is much worse at segmenting connected char- acters. Overall, the performance of most computer programs at solving CAPTCHAs was poor until fairly recently. Nachar et al. (2015) devised a computer program focusing on edge corners (an edge corner is the intersection of two straight edges). Such corners are relatively unaffected by the distortions and overlaps of characters found in CAPTCHAs. Nachar et al.’s approach proved successful, allowing them to solve 57% of CAPTCHAs resembling the one shown in Figure 3.2. There are two take-home messages. First, the difficulties encountered in devising computer pro- grams to solve CAPTCHAs indicate humans have excellent pattern-recognition abilities. Second, edge corners provide an especially valuable source of information in pattern recognition. Of rel- evance, successful camouflage in many species depends heavily on markings that break up an animal’s edges, making it less visible (Webster, 2015). KEY TERM CAPTCHA A Completely Automated Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart involving distorted characters connected together is often used to establish that the user of an internet website is human rather than an automated system. Figure 3.2 The CAPTCHA used by Yahoo. From Gao et al. (2012). IN THE REAL WORLD: FINGERPRINTING An important form of real-world pattern recognition involves experts matching a criminal’s finger- prints (latent print) against stored fingerprint records. Automatic fingerprint identification systems (AFISs) scan huge databases. This typically produces a small number of possible matches to the fingerprint obtained from the crime scene ranked by similarity to the criminal’s fingerprint. Experts then decide which database fingerprint (if any) matches the criminal’s. We might imagine experts are much better at fingerprint matching than novices because their analytic (slow, deliberate) processing is superior. However, Thompson and Tangen (2014) found experts greatly outperformed novices when pairs of fingerprints were presented for only 2 seconds, forcing them to rely heavily on non-analytic (fast and relatively “automatic”) processing. However, when fingerprint pairs were presented for 60 seconds, experts showed a greater performance Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.","evidence":["regation of visual objects.","How this is done was first studied systematically Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14."]}

Thus, experts have superior analytic and non-analytic processing. According to signal-detection theory, experts may surpass novices in their ability to discriminate between matching and non-matching prints. Alternatively, they may simply have a more lenient response bias than novices. If so, they would tend to respond “match” to every pair of prints. Good discrimination is associated with many “hits” (responding “match” on match trials) plus a low false-alarm rate (not responding “match” on non-match trials). In contrast, a lenient response criterion is associated with many false alarms. Thompson et al. (2014) found novices made false alarms on 57% of trials on which two prints were similar but did not match, whereas experts did so on only 1.65% of trials. Thus, experts have a much more conservative response criterion as well as much better discrimination between match- ing and non-matching prints. It is often assumed expert fingerprint identification is very accurate. However, experts listing the minutiae (features) on fingerprints on two occasions showed total agreement between their assess- ments only 16% of the time (Dror et al., 2012). Nevertheless, experts are much less likely than non-experts to decide incorrectly that two fingerprints from the same person are from different individuals (Champod, 2015). Fingerprint identification is often complex. As an example, try to decide whether the fingerprints in Figure 3.3 come from the same person. Four fingerprinting experts said the fingerprint on the right was from the same person as the one on the left (Ouhane Daoud, the bomber involved in the terrorist attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004). In fact, the one on the right came from Brandon Mayfield, an American lawyer who was falsely arrested. Experts’ mistakes are often due to the incompleteness of the fingerprints found at crime scenes. However, top-down processes also contribute. Experts’ errors often involve forensic confirmation bias: “an individual’s pre-existing beliefs, expectations, motives, and situational context influence the collection, perception, and interpretation of evidence” (Kassin et al., 2013, p. 45). Dror et al. (2006) found evidence of forensic confirmation bias. Experts were asked to judge whether two fingerprints matched having been told, incorrectly, that they were the ones mistakenly matched by the FBI as the Madrid bomber. In fact, these experts had judged these fingerprints to be a clear and definite match several years earlier. The misleading information provided led 60% of them to judge the prints to be definite non-matches! Thus, top-down processes triggered by contextual information can distort fingerprint identification. Langenburg et al. (2009) studied the effects of context (e.g., alleged conclusions of inter- nationally respected experts) on fingerprint identification. Experts and non-experts were both influenced by contextual information (and so showed confirmation bias). However, non-experts were influenced more. The above studies on confirmation bias manipulated context very directly and explic- itly. Searston et al. (2016) found a more subtle context effect based on familiarity. Novice par- ticipants were presented initially with a series of cases and fingerprint pairs and given feed- back as to whether the fingerprints matched or not. Then they were presented with cases very similar to those seen previously Figure 3.3 The FBI’s mistaken identification of the Madrid bomber. The fingerprint from the crime scene is on the left. The fingerprint of the innocent suspect (positively identified by various fingerprint experts) is on the right. From Dror et al. (2006). Reprinted with permission from Elsevier.

The participants exhibited response bias during the second part of the experiment: their decisions (i.e., match or no-match) tended to correspond to the correct decisions associated with similar (but not identical) cases encountered earlier. In sum, experts typically outperform novices at fingerprint matching because they have superior discrimination ability and a more conservative response criterion. However, even experts are influ- enced by irrelevant or misleading contextual information and often show evidence of confirmation bias. Worryingly, among forensic experts (including fingerprinting experts), only 52% regarded bias as a matter for concern and even fewer (26%) believed their own judgements were influenced by bias. by the gestaltists, German psychologists (including Koffka, Köhler and Wertheimer) who emigrated to the United States between the two World Wars. Their fundamental principle was the law of Prägnanz – we typically perceive the simplest possible organisation of the visual field. Most of the gestaltists’ other laws can be subsumed under the law of Prägnanz. Figure 3.4(a) illustrates the law of proximity (visual elements close in space tend to be grouped together). Figure 3.4b shows the law of similarity (similar elements tend to be grouped together). We see two crossing lines in Figure 3.4(c) because, according to the law of law continuation, we group together those elements requiring the fewest changes or interruptions in straight or smoothly curving lines. Finally, Figure 3.4(d) illustrates the law of closure: the missing parts of a figure are filled in to complete the figure (here a circle). We might dismiss these principles as “mere textbook curiosities” (Wagemans et al., 2012a, p. 1180). However, the various grouping prin- ciples “pervade virtually all perceptual experiences because they determine the objects and parts that people perceive in their environment” (Wagemans et al., 2012a, p. 1180). The gestaltists emphasised figure-ground segmentation in percep- tion. The figure is perceived as having a distinct form or shape whereas the ground lacks form. In addition, the figure is perceived as being in Figure 3.4 Examples of the Gestalt laws of perceptual organisation: (a) the law of proximity; (b) the law of similarity; (c) the law of good continuation; and (d) the law of closure.

Check these claims with the faces-goblet illusion (see Figure 3.5). When the goblet is perceived as the figure, it seems to be in front of a dark background. Faces are in front of a light background when forming the figure. What determines which region is identi- fied as the figure and which as the ground? Regions that are convex (curving outwards), small, surrounded and symmetrical are most likely to be perceived as figures (Wagemans et al., 2012a). For example, Fowlkes et al. (2007) found with images of natural scenes that regions identified by observers as figures were generally smaller and more convex than ground regions. Finally, the gestaltists argued percep- tual grouping and organisation are innate or intrinsic to the brain. As a result, they de- emphasised the importance of past experience. Findings The gestaltists’ approach was limited because they mostly used artificial figures, making it important to see whether their findings apply to more realistic stimuli. Geisler et al. (2001) used pictures to study the contours of flowers, rivers, trees and so on. They discovered object contours could be calculated accurately using two principles that were different from those emphasised by the gestaltists: (1) Adjacent segments of any contour typically have very similar orientations. (2) Segments of any contour that are further apart generally have some- what different orientations. Geisler et al. (2001) asked observers to decide which of two complex pat- terns presented together contained a winding contour. Task performance was well predicted by the two key principles described above. Elder and Goldberg (2002) analysed the statistics of natural contours and obtained findings largely consistent with Gestalt laws. Proximity was a very powerful cue when deciding which contours belonged to which objects. There was also a small contribution from similarity and good continuation. Numerous cues influence figure-ground segmentation and the percep- tion of object boundaries with natural scenes. Mély et al. (2016) found colour and luminance (see Glossary) strongly influenced the perception of object boundaries. There was more accurate perception of object bound- aries when several cues were combined than that found for any single cue in isolation.

However, figure-ground segmentation is more complex in natural scenes than most artificial figures, and so the Gestalt approach is oversimplified. The gestaltists failed to discover several principles of perceptual organ- isation. For example, Palmer and Rock (1994) proposed the principle of uniform connectedness. According to this principle, any connected region having uniform visual properties (e.g., colour; texture; lightness) tends to be organised as a single perceptual unit. Palmer and Rock found grouping by uniform connectedness dominated proximity and similarity when there was a conflict. Pinna et al. (2016) argued that the gestaltists de-emphasised the role of dissimilarity in perceptual organisation. Consider Figure 3.6. The per- ception of the empty circles as a rotated square or a diamond is strongly influenced by the location of the dissimilar element (i.e., the black circle). This illustrates the principle of accentuation: “Elements group in the same oriented direction of the dissimilar element placed . . . outside a whole set of continuous/homogeneous components” (Pinna et al., 2016, p. 21). Much processing involved in perceptual organisation occurs very rapidly. Williford and von der Heydt (2016) discovered signals from neurons in V2 (see Chapter 2) relating to figure-ground organisation emerged within 70 ms of stimulus presentation for complex natural scenes as well as for simple figures. This extremely rapid processing is consistent with the gestaltists’ assumption that perceptual organisation is due to innate factors but may also reflect massive experience in object recognition. The role of learning was discussed by Bhatt and Quinn (2011). Infants as young as 3 or 4 months show grouping by continuation, proximity and connectedness, which is apparently consistent with the Gestalt position. However, other grouping principles (e.g., closure) were used only later in infancy, and infants typically made increased use of grouping principles over time. Thus, learning is important. Figure 3.6 The dissimilar element (black circle) accentuates the tendency to perceive the array of empty circles as (A) a rotated square or (B) a diamond. From Pinna et al., 2016.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.\n\n102 Visual perception and attention According to the gestaltists, perceptual grouping occurs rapidly and should be uninfluenced by attentional processes. The evidence is mixed. Rashal et al. (2017) conducted several experiments. Attention was not required with grouping by proximity or similarity in colour. However, attention was required with grouping by similarity in shape. In general, attention was more likely to be required when the processes involved in per- ceptual grouping were relatively complex. Overall, the processes involved in perceptual grouping are much more complicated and variable than the gestaltists had assumed. The gestaltists also assumed figure-ground segmentation is innate and so not reliant on past experience or learning. Barense et al. (2012) reported contrary evidence. Amnesic patients (having severe memory problems) and healthy controls were presented with various stimuli, some containing parts of well-known objects (see Figure 3.7). In other stimuli, the object parts were rearranged. The task was to decide which region of each stim- ulus was the figure. The healthy controls identified the regions containing familiar objects as figures more often than those containing rearranged parts. In contrast, the amnesic patients showed no difference between the two types of stimuli because they experienced difficulty in identifying the objects presented. Thus, figure-ground segmentation can depend on past experience and memory (i.e., object familiarity). Several recent theories explain perceptual grouping and figure-ground segmentation. For example, consider Froyen et al.’s (2015) Bayesian hierarchical grouping model, accord- ing to which observers initially form “beliefs” concerning the objects to be expected in the current context. In addition, their visual system assumes the visual image consists of a mixture of objects. The information avail- able in the image is then used to change the subjective probabilities of different group- ing hypotheses to make optimal use of that information. Of key importance, observers use their learned knowledge of patterns and objects (e.g., visual elements close together generally belong to the same object). The above approach exemplifies theories based on Bayesian inference (see Glossary). Their central assumption is that the initial subjective probabilities associated with vari- ous hypotheses as to the organisation of objects within a visual image change on the basis of the information it provides. This approach is much more realistic than the gestaltists’ relatively cut-and-dried approach.

First, the gestaltists focused on key issues (e.g., figure-ground segmentation). Second, nearly all their grouping laws (and the notion of figure-ground segmentation) have stood the test of time and are applicable to natural scenes as well as arti- ficial figures. Third, the notion that observers perceive the simplest possi- ble organisation of the visual environment has proved very fruitful. Many recent theories are based on the assumption that striving for simplicity is central to visual perception (Jäkel et al., 2016). What are the approach’s limitations? First, the gestaltists de- emphasised the importance of past experience and learning. As Wagemans et al. (2012b, p. 1229) pointed out, the gestaltists “focused almost exclu- sively on processes intrinsic to the perceiving organism . . . The environ- ment itself did not interest [them]”. Second, the gestaltists produced descriptions of important perceptual phenomena but not adequate explanations. Recently, however, such expla- nations have been provided. Third, nearly all the evidence the gestaltists provided was based on two-dimensional drawings. The greater complexity of real-world scenes (e.g., important parts of objects hidden or occluded) means additional explanatory assumptions are required. Fourth, the gestaltists did not discover all the principles of percep- tual organisation. Among such undiscovered principles are uniform connectedness, the principle of accentuation and generalised common fate (e.g., when elements of a visual scene become brighter or darker together, they are grouped together). More generally, the gestaltists did not appreciate the sheer complexity of the processes involved in percep- tual grouping. Fifth, the gestaltists focused mostly on drawings involving only one Gestalt law. With natural scenes, several laws often operate simultaneously and interact in complex ways not predicted by the gestaltists (Jäkel et al., 2016). Sixth, the gestaltists’ approach was too inflexible. They did not realise perceptual grouping and figure-ground segregation depend on complex interactions between basic (and possibly innate) processes and past experi- ence (Rashal et al., 2017). APPROACHES TO OBJECT RECOGNITION Object recognition (identifying objects in the visual field) is enormously important if we are to interact effectively with the environment. We start with basic aspects of the human visual system followed by major theories of object recognition. Perception-action model Milner and Goodale’s (1995, 2008) perception-action model (discussed in Chapter 2) is relevant to understanding object perception. It is based on a distinction between ventral (or “what”) and dorsal (or “how”) streams (see Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.","evidence":["m Barense et al.","(2012)."]}

They argued object recognition and perception depend primarily on the ventral stream. This stream is hierarchically organised. Visual processing basically proceeds from the retina through several areas including the lateral geniculate nucleus, V1, V2 and V4, culminating in the inferotemporal cortex. The importance of the ventral stream is indicated by research showing object recognition can be reasonably intact after damage to the dorsal stream (Goodale & Milner, 2018). However, object recognition involves numerous interactions between the ventral and dorsal streams (Freud et al., 2017b). Spatial frequency Visual perception develops over time even though it seems instantaneous (Hegdé, 2008). The visual processing involved in object recognition typ- ically proceeds in a coarse-to-fine way with initial coarse or general pro- cessing followed by fine or detailed processing. As a result, we can perceive visual scenes at a very general level and/or at a fine-grained level. How does coarse-to-fine processing occur? Numerous cells in the primary visual cortex respond to high spatial frequencies and capture fine detail in the visual image. Numerous others respond to low spatial fre- quencies and capture coarse information in the visual image. Low spatial frequency information (often relating to motion and/ or spatial location) is transmitted rapidly to higher-order brain areas via the fast magnocellular system using the dorsal visual stream (discussed in Chapter 2). Awasthi et al. (2016) used red light to produce magnocellular suppression. As predicted, this interfered with the low spatial frequency components of face perception. In contrast, high spatial frequency information (often relating to colour, shape and other aspects of object recognition) is transmitted rel- atively slowly via the parvocellular system using the ventral visual stream (see Chapter 2). This speed difference explains why coarse processing typ- ically precedes fine processing, although conscious perception is typically based on integrated low and high spatial information. We can observe the effects of varying spatial frequency by comparing images con- sisting only of low or high spatial frequency (see Figure 3.8). You probably agree it is con- siderably easier to achieve object recognition with the high spatial frequency image. Findings Musel et al. (2012) presented participants with very brief (150 ms) scenes proceeding from coarse (low spatial frequency) to fine (high spatial frequency) or vice versa (sample videos can be viewed at DOI.10.1371/ journal.pone.003893).

These findings suggest the visual processing of natural scenes is predominantly coarse to fine. This sequence may be more effective because low spatial frequency information is used to generate plausible interpretations of the visual input. There is considerable evidence that global (general) processing often precedes local (specific) processing (discussed on p. 95). Much research has established an association between processing low spatial frequen- cies and global perception and between processing high spatial frequen- cies and local perception. However, use of low and high spatial frequency information in visual processing is often very flexible and is influenced by task demands. Flevaris and Robertson (2016, p. 192) reviewed research showing, “Attention to global and local aspects of a display biases the flex- ible selection of relatively lower and relatively higher SFs [spatial frequen- cies] during image processing.” Finally, we can explain the notoriously elusive smile of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa with reference to spatial frequencies. Livingston (2000) produced images of that painting with different spatial frequencies. Mona Lisa’s smile is much more obvious in the two low spatial frequency images (see Figure 3.9). Livingston pointed out that our central or foveal vision is dominated by higher spatial frequencies compared with our peripheral vision. As a result, “You can’t catch her smile by looking at her mouth. She smiles until you look at her mouth” (p. 1299). Historical background: Marr’s computational approach David Marr (1982) proposed a very influential theory. He argued object recognition involves various processing stages and is much more complex than had previously been thought. More specifically, Marr claimed observ- ers construct various representations (descriptions) providing increasingly detailed information about the visual environment: ● Primal sketch: this provides a two-dimensional description of the main light intensity changes in the visual input, including information about edges and contours.

It resembles the primal sketch in being viewer-centred or viewpoint-dependent (i.e., it is influenced by the angle from which the observer sees objects or the environment). ● 3-D model representation: this describes objects’ shapes and their rel- ative positions three-dimensionally; it is independent of the observer’s viewpoint and so is viewpoint-invariant. Why has Marr’s theoretical approach been so influential? First, he suc- cessfully combined ideas from neurophysiology, anatomy and computer vision (Mather, 2015). Second, he was among the first to realise the enor- mous complexity of object recognition. Third, his distinction between viewpoint-dependent and viewpoint-invariant representations triggered much subsequent research (discussed on pp. 109–111). What are the limitations of Marr’s approach? First, he focused exces- sively on bottom-up processes. Marr (1982, p. 101) admitted, “Top-down processing is sometimes used and necessary.” However, he de-emphasised the major role expectations and knowledge play in object recognition (discussed in detail on pp. 111–116). Second, Marr assumed that “Vision tells the truth about what is out there” (Mather, 2015, p. 44). In fact, there are numerous exceptions. For example, people observed from a tall building (e.g., the Eiffel Tower) seem very small. Another example is the vertical-horizontal illusion – observers typically overestimate the length of a vertical line when it is compared against a horizontal line of the same length (e.g., Gavilán et al., 2017). Third, many processes proposed by Marr are incredibly complex com- putationally. As Mather (2015, p. 44) pointed out, “The computations required to produce view-independent 3-D object models are now thought by many researchers to be too complex.” Biederman’s recognition-by-components theory Biederman’s (1987) recognition-by-components theory developed Marr’s theoretical approach. His central assumption was that objects consist of basic shapes or components known as “geons” (geometric ions); examples include blocks, cylinders, spheres, arcs and wedges. Biederman claimed there are approximately 36 different geons, which sounds suspiciously low to provide descriptions of all objects. However, geons can be combined in almost endless ways. For example, a cup is an arc connected to the side of a cylinder. A pail involves the same two geons but with the arc connected to the top of the cylinder. Figure 3.10 shows the key features of recognition-by-components theory. We have already considered the stage where the components or geons of an object are determined. When this information is available, it is matched with stored object representations or structural models consisting of information about the nature of the relevant geons, their orientations, sizes and so on. Whichever stored representation fits best with the geon- based information obtained from the visual object determines which object is identified by observers.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.\n\nObject and face recognition 107 As indicated in Figure 3.10, the first step in object recognition is edge extraction in which various aspects of the visual stimulus (e.g., luminance; texture; colour) are pro- cessed, leading to a description of the object resembling a line drawing. After that, deci- sions are made as to how the object should be segmented to establish its geons. Which edge information should observ- ers focus on? According to Biederman (1987), non-accidental image properties are crucial. These are aspects of the visual image that are invariant across different viewing angles. Examples include whether an edge is straight or curved and whether a contour is concave (hollow) or convex (bulging) with the former of particular importance. Biederman assumed objects’ geons of a visual object are constructed from various non-accidental or invariant properties. This part of the theory leads to the key prediction that object recognition is typi- cally viewpoint-invariant (i.e., objects can be recognised equally easily from nearly all viewing angles). The argument is that object recognition depends crucially on the identifi- cation of geons, which can be identified from numerous viewpoints. Thus, object recogni- tion is difficult only when one or more geons are hidden from view. How do we recognise objects in subop- timal viewing conditions (e.g., an intervening object obscures part of the target object)? First, non-accidental properties can still be detected even when only parts of edges are visible. Second, if the concavities of a contour are visible, there are mechanisms for restoring the missing parts of the contour. Third, we can recognise many objects when some geons are missing because there is much redun- dant information under optimal viewing conditions. Findings Non-accidental properties play a vital role in object recognition (Parker & Serre, 2015). For example, it is easier to distinguish between two objects differing in non- accidental prop- erties. In addition, neuroimaging studies Irving Biederman. University of Southern California.

Rolls and Mills (2018) developed a model of object recognition showing how non-accidental properties of objects can promote viewpoint-invariant object recognition. There is general agreement that an object’s contour or outline is important in object recognition. For example, camouflage in many animal species is achieved by markings breaking up and distorting contour infor- mation (Webster, 2015). There is also general agreement that concavities and convexities are especially informative regions of an object’s contour. However, the evidence relating to Biederman’s (1987) assumption that concavity is more important than convexity in object recognition is mixed (Schmidtmann et al., 2015). In their own study, Schmidtmann et al. (2015) focused specifically on shape recognition using unfamiliar shapes. Shape recognition depended more on information about convexities than concavities (although con- cavity information had some value). They argued convexity information is likely to be more important because convexities reveal an object’s outer boundary. According to the theory, object recognition depends on edge rather than surface information (e.g., colour). However, Sanocki et al. (1998) argued that edge-extraction processes are less likely to produce accurate object recognition when objects are presented in the context of other objects rather than on their own. This is because it can be hard to decide which edges belong to which objects when several objects are presented together. Sanocki et al. presented observers briefly with objects, with line drawings, or full-colour photographs of objects. As predicted, object recognition was much worse with the line drawings than the full-colour photographs when objects were presented in context. A key theoretical prediction is that object recognition is typically viewpoint-invariant. Biederman and Gerhardstein (1993) supported this prediction when familiar objects presented at different angles were named rapidly. However, numerous other studies have failed to obtain evidence for viewpoint-invariance. This is especially the case with unfamiliar objects differing from familiar objects in not having previously been viewed from multiple viewpoints (discussed in next section on pp. 109–111). Evaluation Biederman’s (1987) recognition-by-components theory has been very influ- ential. It indicates how we can identify objects despite substantial differ- ences among the members of most categories in shape, size and orientation. The assumption that non-accidental properties of stimuli and geons play a role in object recognition has received much support. What are the theory’s limitations? First, it focuses predominantly on bottom-up processes triggered directly by the stimulus input. As a result, it de-emphasises the impact on object recognition of top-down processes based on expectation (Trapp & Bar, 2015; discussed further on pp. 111–116). Second, the theory accounts only for fairly unsubtle percep- tual discriminations. It cannot explain how we decide whether an animal is, for example, a particular breed of dog or cat.

As Hayward and Tarr (2005, p. 67) pointed out, “You can take almost any object, put a working light-bulb on the top, and call it a lamp.” Does viewpoint influence object recognition? Form a visual image of a bicycle. Your image probably involved a side view with both wheels clearly visible. We can use this example to discuss a theo- retical controversy. Consider an experiment where some participants see a photograph of a bicycle in the typical (or canonical) view as in your visual image, whereas others see a photograph of the same bicycle viewed end-on or from above. Would those given the typical view identify the object as a bicycle fastest? We will address the above question shortly. Before that, we must discuss two key terms mentioned earlier. If object recognition is equally rapid and easy regardless of viewing angle, it is viewpoint-invariant. In con- trast, if object recognition is faster and easier when objects are seen from certain angles, it is viewer-centred or viewpoint-dependent. Another impor- tant distinction is between categorisation (e.g., is the object a dog?) and identification (e.g., is the object a poodle?), which requires within-category discriminations. Findings Milivojevic (2012) reviewed behavioural research in this area. Object rec- ognition is typically uninfluenced by an object’s orientation when cate- gorisation is required (i.e., it is viewpoint-invariant). In contrast, object recognition is significantly slower if an object’s orientation differs from its canonical or typical viewpoint when identification is required (i.e., it is viewer-centred). Hamm and McMullen (1998) reported supporting findings. Changes in viewpoint had no effect on speed of object recogni- tion when categorisation was required (e.g., deciding an object was a car). However, there were clear effects of changing viewpoint with identification (e.g., deciding whether an object was a taxi). Small (or non-significant) effects of object orientation on categorisa- tion time do not necessarily indicate orientation has not affected internal processing. Milivojevic et al. (2011) found stimulus orientation had only small effects on speed and accuracy of categorisation. However, early com- ponents of the event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) were larger when stimuli were not in the upright position. Thus, stimulus orientation had only modest effects on task performance but perceptual processing was less demanding with upright stimuli. Neuroimaging research has enhanced our understanding of object rec- ognition (Milivojevic, 2012). With categorisation tasks, brain activation is mostly very similar regardless of object orientation. However, orientation influences brain activity early in processing suggesting initial processing is viewpoint-dependent. With identification tasks, there is typically greater activation of areas within the inferior temporal cortex when objects are not in their typical or canonical orientation (Milivojevic, 2012).

Identification may require additional processing (e.g., more detailed processing of object features) for objects presented in unusual orientations. Learning influences the extent to which object recognition is viewpoint- dependent or viewpoint-invariant. Zimmermann and Eimer (2013) presented unfamiliar faces on 640 trials. Face recognition was viewpoint-dependent initially but became more viewpoint-invariant there- after. Learning caused more information about each face to be stored in long-term memory and this facilitated rapid access to visual face memory regardless of facial orientation. Etchells et al. (2017) also studied the effects of learning on face recog- nition. During learning, observers were repeatedly shown one or two views of unfamiliar faces. Subsequently they were shown a novel view of these faces. There was evidence of viewpoint-invariant face recognition when learning had been based on two different views but not when it had been based on only a single view. Related research was reported by Weibert et al. (2016). They found evidence of a viewpoint-invariant response in face-selective regions of the medial temporal lobe with familiar (but not unfamiliar) faces. Thus, viewpoint-invariant responses during object recognition are more fre- quent for faces for which observers have stored considerable relevant information. Evidence of viewpoint-dependent or viewpoint-invariant responses within the brain often depends on the precise brain areas studied. Erez et al. (2016) found viewpoint-dependent responses in several visual areas (e.g., fusiform face area) but viewpoint-invariant responses in the perirhinal cortex. There is more evidence for viewpoint-invariant brain responses late rather than early in visual processing. Why is that? As Erez et al. (p. 2271) argued, “Representations of low-level features are transformed into more complex and invariant representations as information flows through suc- cessive stages of [processing].” Most research is limited because object recognition is typically assessed in only one context, which may prompt either viewpoint- invariant or viewpoint-dependent recognition performance. Tarr and Hayward (2017) argued this approach can misleadingly suggest observers store only viewpoint-invariant or viewpoint-dependent information. Accordingly, they used various contexts. Observers originally learned the identities of novel objects that could be discriminated by viewpoint-invariant informa- tion. As predicted, they exhibited viewpoint-invariant object recognition when tested. When the testing context was changed to make it hard to continue to use that approach, observers shifted to exhibiting viewpoint- dependent behaviour. The central conclusion from the above findings is that: “Object rep- resentations are neither viewpoint-dependent nor viewpoint-invariant, but rather encode multiple kinds of information . . . deployed in a flex- ible manner appropriate to context and task” (Tarr & Hayward, 2017, p. 108). Thus, visual object representations contain richer and more var- iegated information than typically assumed on the basis of limited testing conditions.

Gauthier and Tarr (2016, p. 379) argued researchers should address the following question: “What is the nature of the features that com- prise high-level visual representations and lead to image-dependence or image-invariance?” Thus, we should focus more on why object recognition is viewpoint-invariant or viewpoint-dependent. As yet, “The exact and fine-grained features of object representations are still unknown and are not easily resolved” (Gauthier & Tarr, 2016, p. 379). OBJECT RECOGNITION: TOP-DOWN PROCESSES Historically, most theorists (e.g., Marr, 1982; Biederman, 1987) studying object recognition emphasised bottom-up processes. Apparent support can be found in the hierarchical nature of visual processing. As Yardley et al. (2012, p. 4) pointed out, Traditionally, visual object recognition has been taken as mediated by a hierarchical, bottom-up stream that processes an image by systematically analysing its individual elements and relaying this information to the next areas until the overall form and identity are determined. The above account, assuming a feedforward hierarchy of processing stages from visual cortex through to inferotemporal cortex, is oversimplified. There are as many backward projecting neurons (associated with top-down processing) as forward projecting ones throughout most of the visual system (Gilbert & Li, 2013). Up to 90% of the synapses from incoming neurons to primary visual cortex (involved in early visual processing) originate in the cortex and thus reflect top-down processes. Recurrent processing (a form of top-down processing) from higher to lower brain areas is often necessary for conscious visual perception (van Gaal & Lamme, 2012; see Chapter 16). Top-down processes should have their greatest impact on object rec- ognition when bottom-up processes are relatively uninformative (e.g., when observers are presented with degraded or briefly presented stimuli). Support for this prediction is discussed on p. 112. Findings Evidence for the involvement of top-down processes in visual percep- tion was reported by Goolkasian and Woodberry (2010). They presented observers with ambiguous figures immediately preceded by primes relevant to one interpretation (see Figure 3.11). The primes systematically biased the interpretation of the ambiguous figures via top-down processes.

(2008) obtained strong evidence that top-down pro- cesses within the prefrontal cortex influence object recognition. Observers viewed blurred or non-blurred photographs of living and non-living objects. On some trials, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; see Glossary) was applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to disrupt top- down processing. rTMS slowed object recognition time only with blurred photographs. Thus, top-down processes were directly involved in object recognition when the sensory information available to bottom-up processes was limited. Controversy Firestone and Scholl (2016) argued in a review, “There is . . . no evidence for top-down effects of cognition on visual perception.” They claimed that top-down processes often influence response bias, attention or memory rather than perception itself.

Black Americans are more than twice as likely as white Americans to be unarmed when killed by the police (Ross, 2015). For example, on 22 November 2014, a police officer in Cleveland, Ohio, shot dead a 12-year-old black male (Tamir Rice) playing with a replica pistol. Shooter bias may reflect top-down influences on visual perception. Payne (2006) presented a white or black face followed by the very brief presentation of a gun or tool. When participants made a rapid response, they indicated falsely they had seen a gun more often when the face was black. Shooter bias reflects top-down effects based on inaccurate racial stereotypes associating black individuals with threat (e.g., Azevedo et al., 2017). This bias might be due to direct top-down effects on perception: objects are more likely to be misperceived as guns if held by black indi- viduals. Alternatively, shooter bias may reflect response bias (the expectation someone has a gun is greater if that person is black rather than white): there is no effect on perception but shooters require less perceptual evidence to shoot a black individual. Azevedo et al. (2017) found a briefly presented weapon (a gun) was more accurately perceived when preceded by a black face than a white one. However, the opposite was the case when a tool was presented. These findings were due to response bias rather than perception. Moore-Berg et al. (2017) asked non-black participants to decide rapidly whether or not to shoot an armed or unarmed white or black person of high or low socio-economic status. There was shooter bias: participants were biased towards shooting if the individual was black, of low socio-economic status, or both. This shooter bias mostly reflected a response bias against shooting a white person of high socio-economic status (probably because of a low level of perceived danger). First, consider ambiguous or reversible figures (e.g., the faces-goblet illusion shown in Figure 3.5). Observers alternate between the two possible interpretations (e.g., faces vs goblet). The dominant one at any moment depends on their direction of attention but not necessarily on top-down processes (Long & Toppino, 2004). Second, Auckland et al. (2007) presented observers briefly with a target object (e.g., playing cards) surrounded by four context objects. When the context objects were semantically related to the target (e.g., dice; chess pieces; plastic chips; dominoes), the target was recognised more often than when they were semantically unrelated. This finding depended in part on response bias (i.e., guesses based on context) rather than perceptual infor- mation about the target. (More evidence of response bias is discussed in the Box). Firestone and Scholl’s (2016) article has provoked much controversy. Lupyan (2016, p. 40) attacked their tendency to attribute apparent top- down effects on perception to attention, memory and so on: “This ‘It’s not perception, it’s just X’ reasoning assumes that attention, memory, and so forth be cleanly split from perception proper.” In fact, all these pro- cesses interact dynamically and so attention, perception and memory are not clearly separate.

First, there are visual hallu- cinations which are found in schizophrenic patients. Hallucinations are experienced as actual perceptions even though the relevant object is not present and so they cannot depend on bottom-up processes. Second, there is visual imagery (discussed on pp. 130–137). Visual imagery involves several processes involved in visual perception. Like halluci- nations, visual imagery occurs in the absence of bottom-up processes because the relevant object is absent. Lupyan (2017) discussed numerous top- down effects on visual perception in studies avoiding the problems identified by Firestone and Scholl (2016). Look at Figure 3.12, which apparently shows an ordinary brick wall. If that is what you see, have another look. This time see whether you can spot the object mentioned at the end of the Conclusions section. Once you have spotted the object, it becomes impossible not to see it afterwards. Here we have powerful effects of top-down processing on perception based on knowledge of what is in the photograph. Conclusions As Firestone and Scholl (2016) argued, it is hard to demonstrate top-down processes directly influence perception rather than attention, memory or response bias. However, many studies have shown such a direct influence. As Yardley et al. (2012, p. 1) pointed out, “Perception relies on existing knowledge as much as it does on incoming information.” Note, however, the influence of top-down processes is generally greater when visual stimuli are degraded. By the way, the hard-to-spot object in the photograph is a cigar! Theories emphasising top-down processes Bar et al. (2006) found greater activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (part of the prefrontal cortex) when object recognition was hard than when it was easy. This activation occurred 50 ms before activation in recognition-related regions of the temporal cortex, and so seemed impor- tant for object recognition. In Bar et al.’s model, object recognition depends on top-down processes involving the orbitofrontal cortex and bottom-up processes involving the ventral visual stream (see Figure 3.13; and Chapter 2).

Subsequent top-down processes associated with the orbitofrontal cortex select relevant hypotheses and sup- press irrelevant ones. More specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex uses contextual infor- mation to generate hypotheses and resolve competition among hypotheses. Palmer (1975) showed the importance of context. He presented a picture of a scene (e.g., a kitchen) followed by the very brief presenta- tion of the picture of an object. The object was recognised more often when relevant to the context (e.g., a loaf) than when irrelevant (e.g., a drum). Interactive-iterative framework Baruch et al. (2018) argued that previous theo- rists had not appreciated the full complexities of interactions between bottom-up and top- down processes in object recognition. They rectified this situation with their interactive- iterative framework (see Figure 3.14). According to this framework, observers typically form hypotheses concerning object identity based on their goals, knowledge and the environmental context. Of importance, these hypotheses are often formed before the object is presented. Observers discriminate among competing hypotheses by attend- ing to a distinguishing feature of the object. For example, if your tentative hypothesis was elephant, you might allocate attention to the expected location of its trunk. If that failed to provide the necessary information because that area was partially hidden (see Figure 3.15), you might then attend to other features (e.g., size and shape of the leg; skin texture). In sum, Baruch et al. (2018) emphasised two related top-down processes strongly influ- encing object recognition. First, observers form hypotheses about the possible identity of an object prior to (or in interaction with) the visual input. Second, observers direct their attention to object parts likely to be maximally informative concerning its identity. Figure 3.13 In this modified version of Bar et al.’s (2006) theory, it is assumed that object recognition involves two different routes: (1) a top-down route in which information proceeds rapidly to the orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in generating predictions about the object’s identity; (2) a bottom-up route using the slower ventral visual stream.

Kok et al. (2017) obtained support for this predic- tion. Observers expecting a given stimulus produced a neural signal resembling that generated by the actual presentation of the stimulus shortly before it was presented. Baruch et al. (2018) tested various pre- dictions from their theoretical framework. In one experiment, participants decided which of two types of artificial fish (tass or grout) had been presented. The two fish types dif- fered with respect to distinguishing features associated with the tail and the mouth, with the tail being easier to discriminate. As pre- dicted, participants generally attended more to the tail than the mouth region from stimulus onset. When much of the tail region was hidden from view, participants redirected their attention to the mouth region. Summary Numerous theorists have argued that object recognition depends on top-down processes as well as bottom-up ones. Baruch et al.’s (2018) interactive-iterative framework extends such ideas by identifying how these two types of processes interact. Of central importance, top-down processes influence the allocation of attention, and the allocation of attention influ- ences subsequent bottom-up processing. FACE RECOGNITION There are two main reasons for devoting a section to face recognition. First, recognising faces is of enormous importance to us, since we gener- ally identify individuals from their faces. Form a visual image of someone important in your life – it probably contains detailed information about their face. Second, face recognition differs importantly from other forms of object recognition. As a result, we need theories specifically devoted to face recog- nition rather than simply relying on theories of object recognition. Face vs object recognition How does face recognition differ from object recognition? There is more holistic processing in face recognition. Holistic processing involves “inte- gration across the area of the face, or processing of the relationships between features as well as, or instead of, the features themselves” (Watson & Robbins, 2014, p. 1). Holistic processing is faster because facial features Figure 3.15 Recognising an elephant when a key feature (its trunk) is partially hidden. From Baruch et al. (2018).

(2014) found faces can be categorised as familiar or unfamiliar within approxi- mately 200 ms. Holistic processing is also more reliable than feature pro- cessing because individual facial features (e.g., mouth shape) are subject to change. Relevant evidence comes from the face inversion effect: faces are much harder to identify when presented inverted or upside-down rather than upright (Bruyer, 2011). This effect probably reflects difficulties in processing inverted faces holistically. There are surprisingly large effects of face inversion within the brain – Rosenthal et al. (2017, p. 4823) found face inversion “induces a dramatic functional reorganisation across related brain networks”. In contrast, adverse effects of inversion are often much smaller with non-face objects. For example, Klargaard et al. (2018) found there was a larger inversion effect for faces than for cars. However, it can be argued we possess expertise in face recognition and so we should consider individuals possessing expertise with non-face objects. The findings are mixed. Rossion and Curran (2010) found car experts had a much smaller inversion effect for cars than faces. However, those with the greatest expertise showed a greater inversion effect for cars. In contrast, Weiss et al. (2016) found horse experts had no inversion effect for horses. More evidence suggesting faces are special comes from the part-whole effect – it is easier to recognise a face part when presented within a whole face rather than in isolation. Farah (1994) studied this effect using drawings of faces and houses. Participants’ ability to recognise face parts was much better when whole faces were presented rather than only a single feature (i.e., the part-whole effect). In contrast, recognition per- formance for house features was very similar in whole and single-feature conditions. Richler et al. (2011) explored the hypothesis that faces are processed holistically by using composite faces. Composite faces consist of a top half and a bottom half that may or may not be from the same face. The task was to decide whether the top halves of two successive composite faces were the same or different. Performance was worse when the bottom halves of the two composite faces were different. This composite face effect sug- gests people find it hard to ignore the bottom halves and thus that face processing is holistic. Finally, accurate face recognition is so important to humans we might expect to find holistic processing of faces even in young children. As pre- dicted, children aged between 3 and 5 show holistic processing (McKone et al., 2012). In sum, face recognition (even in young children) involves holistic pro- cessing. However, it remains unclear whether the processing differences between faces and other objects occur because faces are special or because we have dramatically more expertise with faces than most other object cat- egories. Relevant evidence was reported by Ross et al. (2018). When par- ticipants were presented with car pictures, car experts formed more holistic representations within the brain than did car novices. The role played by expertise is discussed further shortly. KEY TERM Face inversion effect The finding that faces are much harder to recognise when presented upside down; the effect of inversion is less marked (or absent) with other objects. Part-whole effect The finding that a face part is recognised more easily when presented in the context of a whole face rather than on its own.

Such patients suffer from prosopagnosia (pros-uh-pag- NO-see-uh) coming from the Greek words for “face” and “without knowl- edge”. Prosopagnosia is also known as “face blindness”. Prosopagnosia is a heterogeneous or diverse condition with the precise problems of face and object recognition varying across patients. It can be caused by brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia) or can occur in the absence of any obvious brain damage (developmental prosopagnosia). Acquired prosopagnosics differ in terms of their specific face-processing deficits and brain areas involved (discussed later). Studying prosopagnosics is of direct relevance to the issue of whether face recognition involves specific or specialised processes absent from object recognition. If prosopagnosics invariably have great impairments in object recognition, it would suggest face and object recognition involve similar processes. In contrast, if some prosopagnosics have intact object recognition, it would imply the processes underlying the two forms of rec- ognition are different. Farah (1991) reviewed research on patients with acquired prosop- agnosia. All these patients also had more general problems with object recognition. However, some exceptions have been reported. Moscovitch KEY TERM Prosopagnosia A condition (also known as face blindness) in which there is a severe impairment in face recognition but much less impairment of object recognition; it is often the result of brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia) but can also be due to impaired development of face- recognition mechanisms (developmental prosopagnosia). IN REAL LIFE: HEATHER SELLERS We can understand the profound problems prosopagnosics suffer in everyday life by considering Heather Sellers (see YouTube: “You Don’t Look Like Anyone I Know”). She is an American woman with severe prosopagnosia. When she was a child, she became separated from her mother at a grocery store. When reu- nited with her mother, she did not initially recog- nise her. Heather Sellers still has difficulty in recognising her own face. Heather: “A few times I have been in a crowded elevator with mirrors all found and a woman will move, and I will go to get out the way and then realise ‘oh that woman is me’.” Such experiences made her very anxious. Surprisingly, Heather Sellers was 36 before she realised she had prosopagnosia. Why was this? As a child, she became very skilled at identifying people by their hair style, body type, clothing, voice and gait. In spite of these skills, she has occasionally failed to recognise her own husband! According to Heather Sellers, “Not being able to reliably know who people are – it feels terrible like failing all the time.” Heather Sellers. Patricia Roehling.

He performed comparably to healthy controls on several face- recognition tasks including photos, caricatures and cartoons. Geskin and Behrmann (2018) reviewed the literature on patients with developmental prosopagnosia. Out of 238 cases, 80% had impaired object recognition but 20% did not. Thus, several patients had impaired face recognition but not object recognition. We would have a double dissocia- tion (see Glossary) if we could find individuals with developmental object agnosia but intact face recognition. Germine et al. (2011) found a female (AW), who had preserved face recognition but impaired object recognition for many categories of objects. Overall, far more individuals have impaired face recognition (prosop- agnosia) but relatively intact object recognition than have impaired object recognition but intact face recognition. These findings suggest that, “Face recognition is an especially difficult instance of object recognition where both systems [i.e., face and object recognition] rely on a common mecha- nism” (Geskin & Behrmann, 2018, p. 18). Face recognition is hard in part because it involves distinguishing among broadly similar category members (e.g., two eyes; nose; mouth). In contrast, object recognition often only involves identifying the relevant category (e.g., cat; car). According to this viewpoint, prosopagnosics would perform poorly if required to make fine- grained perceptual judgments with objects. An alternative interpretation emphasises expertise (Wang et al., 2016). Nearly everyone has more experience (and expertise) at recognising faces than the great majority of other objects. It is thus possible that brain damage in prosopagnosics affects areas associated with expertise gener- ally rather than specifically faces (the expertise hypothesis is discussed on pp. 122–124). Findings In spite of their poor conscious or explicit recognition of faces, many prosopagnosics show evidence of covert recognition (face processing without conscious awareness). For example, Eimer et al. (2012) found developmental prosopagnosics were much worse than healthy controls at explicit recognition of famous faces (27% vs 82% correct, respectively). However, famous faces produced brain activity in half the developmen- tal prosopagnosics indicating the relevant memory traces were activated (covert recognition). These prosopagnosics have very poor explicit recogni- tion performance because brain areas containing more detailed information about the famous individuals were not activated. Busigny et al. (2010b) compared the first two interpretations discussed above by using object-recognition tasks requiring complex within-category distinctions for several categories: birds, boats, cars, chairs and faces. A male patient (GG) with acquired prosopagnosia was as accurate as con- trols with each non-face category (see Figure 3.16). However, he was sub- stantially less accurate than controls with faces (67% vs 94%, respectively). Thus, GG apparently has a face-specific impairment rather than a general inability to recognise complex stimuli.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.\n\n120 Visual perception and attention Busigny et al. (2010a) reviewed previous findings suggesting many patients with acquired prosopagnosia have essentially intact object rec- ognition. However, this research was limited because the difficulty of the recognition decisions required of the patients was not controlled systemat- ically. Busigny et al. manipulated the similarity between target items and distractors on an object-recognition task. Increasing similarity had com- parable effects on PS (a patient with acquired prosopagnosia) and healthy controls. In contrast, PS performed very poorly on a face-recognition task which was very easy for healthy controls. Why is face recognition so poor in prosopagnosics? Busigny et al. (2010b) tested the hypothesis that they have great difficulty with holistic processing. A prosopagnosic patient (GG) did not show the face inversion or composite face effects suggesting he does not perceive individual faces holistically (an ability enhancing accurate face recognition). In contrast, GG’s object recognition was intact perhaps because holistic processing was not required. Van Belle et al. (2011) also investigated the deficient holistic process- ing hypothesis. GG’s face-recognition performance was poor when holistic processing was possible. However, it was intact when it was not possible to use holistic processing (only one part of a face was visible at a time). Finally, we consider the expertise hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, faces differ from most other categories of objects in that we have more expertise in identifying faces. As a result, apparent differences between faces and other objects in processes and brain mechanisms may mostly reflect differences in expertise. This hypothesis is discussed further below on pp. 122–124. Barton and Corrow (2016) reported evidence consistent with this hypothesis in patients with acquired prosopagnosia who had expertise in car recognition and reading prior to their brain damage. These patients had impairments in car recognition and aspects of visual word reading suggesting they had problems with objects for which they had possessed expertise (i.e., objects of expertise). Contrary evidence was reported by Weiss et al. (2016), who studied a patient (OH) with developmental prosopagnosia. In spite of severely impaired face-recognition ability, she displayed superior recognition skills for horses (she had spent 15 years working with them). Thus, visual expertise can be acquired independently of the mechanisms responsible for expertise in face recognition.

However, more general recognition impairments have also often been reported and are apparently inconsistent with that hypoth- esis. There is also some support for the expertise hypothesis but again the findings are mixed. Fusiform face area If faces are processed differently to other objects, we would expect to find brain regions specialised for face processing. The fusiform face area (FFA) in the ventral temporal cortex has (as its name strongly implies!) been iden- tified as such a brain region. The fusiform face area is indisputably involved in face process- ing. Downing et al. (2006) found the fusiform face area responded more strongly to faces than any of 18 object categories (e.g., tools; fruits; veg- etables). However, other brain regions, including the occipital face area (OFA) and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are also face-selective (Grill-Spector et al., 2017; see Figure 3.17). Such findings indicate that face processing depends on one or more brain networks rather than simply on the fusiform face area. Even though several brain areas are face-selective, the fusiform face area has been regarded as having special importance. For example, Axelrod and Yovel (2015) considered brain activity in several face- selective regions when observers were shown photos of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. The fusiform face area was the only region in which the pattern of brain activity differed significantly between these actors. However, Kanwisher et al. (1997) found only 80% of their partic- ipants had greater activation within the fusiform face area to faces than to other objects. In sum, the fusiform face area plays a major role in face processing and recognition for most (but probably not all) individuals. However, face KEY TERM Fusiform face area An area that is associated with face processing; the term is somewhat misleading given that the area is also associated with processing other categories of objects.

Note also that the fusiform face area is activated when we process numerous types of non-face objects. Finally, face-processing deficits in prosopagnosics are not limited to the fusiform face area. For example, developmental prosopagnosics had less selectivity for faces than healthy controls in 12 different face areas (includ- ing the fusiform face area) (Jiahui et al., 2018). Expertise hypothesis According to advocates of the expertise hypothesis (e.g., Wang et al., 2016; discussed on p. 119), major differences between face and object processing should not be taken at face value (sorry!). According to this hypothesis, the brain and processing mechanisms allegedly specific to faces are also involved in processing and recognising all object categories for which we possess expertise. Thus, we should perhaps relabel the fusiform face area as the “fusiform expertise area”. Why is expertise so important in determining face and object process- ing? One reason is that expertise leads to greater holistic or integrated pro- cessing. For example, chess experts can very rapidly use holistic processing based on their relevant stored knowledge to understand complex chess positions (see Chapter 12). Three main predictions follow from the expertise hypothesis: (1) Holistic or configural processing is not unique to faces but should be found for any objects of expertise. (2) The fusiform face area should be highly activated when observ- ers recognise the members of any category for which they possess expertise. (3) If the processing of faces and of objects of expertise involves similar processes, then processing objects of expertise should interfere with face processing. Findings The first prediction is plausible. Wallis (2013) tested a model of object rec- ognition to assess the effects of prolonged exposure to any given stimulus category. The model predicted that many phenomena associated with face processing (e.g., holistic processing; inversion effect) would be found for any stimulus category for which observers had expertise. Repeated simulta- neous presentation of the same features (e.g., nose; mouth; eyes) gradually increases holistic processing. Wallis concluded a single model can explain object and face recognition. There is some support for the first prediction in research on detection of abnormalities in medical images (see Chapter 12). Kundel et al. (2007) found experts generally fixated on an abnormality in under 1 second sug- gesting they used very fast, holistic processes. However, as we saw earlier, experts with non-face objects often have a small inversion effect (assumed to reflect holistic processing). McKone et al. (2007) found such experts Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.","evidence":["-FA OFA FFA ATL-FA Interactive feature: Primal Pictures’ 3D atlas of the brain Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.","122 Visual perception and attention processing depends on a brain network, including several areas in addition to the fusiform face area (see Figure 3.17)."]}

We turn now to the second prediction. In a review, McKone et al. (2007) found a modest tendency for the fusiform face area to be more activated by objects of expertise than other objects. However, larger acti- vation effects for objects of expertise were found outside the fusiform face area than inside it. Support for the second prediction was reported by McGugin et al. (2014): activation to car stimuli within the fusiform face area was greater in participants having greater car expertise. McGugin et al. (2018) argued that we can test the second prediction by comparing individuals varying in face-recognition ability (or exper- tise). As predicted, those with high face-recognition ability exhibited more face-selective activation within the fusiform face area than those having low ability. Bilalić (2016) found chess experts had more activation in the fusiform face area than non-experts when viewing chess positions but not single chess pieces. He concluded, “The more complex the stimuli, the more likely it is that the brain will require the help of the FFA in grasping its essence” (p. 1356). It is important not to oversimplify the issues here. Even if face process- ing and processing of other objects of expertise both involve the fusiform face area, the two forms of processing may use different neurons in differ- ent combinations (Grill-Spector et al., 2017). We turn now to the third prediction. McKeeff et al. (2010) found that car experts were slower than novices when searching for face targets among cars but not among watches. Car and face expertise may have interfered with each other because they depend on similar processes. Alternatively, car experts may have been more likely than car novices to attend to dis- tracting cars because they find such stimuli more interesting. McGugin et al. (2015) also tested the third prediction. Overall, car experts had greater activation than car novices in face-selective areas (e.g., fusiform face area) when processing cars. Of key importance, that differ- ence was greatly reduced when faces were also presented. Thus, interfer- ence was created when participants processed objects belonging to two different categories of expertise (i.e., cars and faces). Evaluation There is some support for the expertise hypothesis with respect to all three predictions. However, the extent of that support remains controversial. One reason is that it is hard to assess expertise level accurately or to control it. It is certainly possible that many (but not all) processing differences between faces and other objects are due to greater expertise with faces. This would imply that faces are less special than often assumed. According to the expertise hypothesis, we are face experts. This may be true of familiar faces, but it is certainly not true of unfamiliar faces (Young & Burton, 2018).

How many different individuals are shown? Provide your answer before reading on. In a study by Jenkins et al. (2011) using a similar stimulus array, participants on average decided 7.5 different individuals were shown. However, the actual number for the array used by Jenkins et al. and the one shown in Figure 3.18 is only two! The two individuals (A and B) are arranged as shown below: A B A A A B A B A B A A A A A B B B A B B B B A A A B B A A B A B A A B B B B B Perhaps we are poor at matching unfamiliar faces because we rarely perform this task in every- day life. White et al. (2014) addressed this issue in a study on passport officers averaging 8 years of service. These passport officers indicated on each trial whether a photograph was that of a physi- cally present person. Overall, 6% of valid photos were rejected and 14% of fraudulent photos were wrongly accepted. Thus, individuals with specialist training and experience are not exempt from problems in matching unfamiliar faces. The main problem is that there is considerable variability in how an individual looks in different photos (discussed further on p. 127).

(2014) compared the performance of passport officers and students on a matching task with unfamiliar faces. The two groups were comparable with 71% correct performance on match trials and 89% on non-match trials. Thus, training and experience were irrelevant. In White et al.’s (2014) research, 50% of the photos were invalid (non-matching). This is (hope- fully!) a massively higher percentage of invalid photos than typically found at passport control. Papesh and Goldinger (2014) compared performance when actual mismatches occurred on 50% or 10% of trials. In the 50% condition, mismatches were missed on 24% of trials, whereas they were missed on 49% of trials in the 10% condition. Participants had a low expectation of mismatches in the 10% condition and so were very cautious about deciding two photos were of different individ- uals (i.e., they had a very cautious response criterion indicating response bias). Papesh et al. (2018) replicated the above findings. They attempted to improve performance in the condition where mismatches occurred on only 10% of trials by introducing blocks where mismatches occurred on 90% of trials. However, this manipulation had little effect because partic- ipants were reluctant to abandon their very cautious response criterion. How can we provide better security at passport control? Increased practice at matching unfamil- iar faces is not the answer – White et al. (2014) found performance was unrelated to the number of years passport officers had served. A promising approach is to find individuals having an excep- tional ability to recognise faces (super-recognisers). Robertson et al. (2016) asked participants to decide whether face pairs depicted the same person. Mean accuracy was 96% for previously iden- tified police super-recognisers compared to only 81% for police trainees. Why do some individuals have very superior face-recognition ability? Wilmer et al. (2010) found the face-recognition performance of monozygotic (identical) twins was much closer than that of dizygotic (fraternal) twins, indicating face-recognition ability is strongly influenced by genetic factors. Face-recognition ability correlated very modestly with other forms of recognition (e.g., abstract art images), suggesting it is very specific. In similar fashion, Turano et al. (2016) found good and poor face recognisers did not differ with respect to car-recognition ability. KEY TERM Super-recognisers Individuals with an outstanding ability to recognise faces. Theoretical approaches Bruce and Young’s (1986) model has been the most influential theoretical approach to face processing and recognition and so we start with it. It is a serial stage model consisting of eight components (see Figure 3.19): (1) Structural encoding: this produces various descriptions or representa- tions of faces. (2) Expression analysis: people’s emotional states are inferred from their facial expression. (3) Facial speech analysis: speech perception is assisted by lip reading (see Chapter 9). (4) Direct visual processing: specific facial information is processed selectively. (5) Face recognition units: these contain structural information about known faces; this structural information emphasises the less change- able aspects of the face and is fairly abstract. (6) Person identity nodes: these provide information about individuals (e.g., occupation; interests). (7) Name generation: a person’s name is stored separately.

Interactive exercise: Face recognition Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.\n\n126 Visual perception and attention (8) Cognitive system: this contains addi- tional information (e.g., most actors have attractive faces); it influences which components receive attention. What predictions follow? First, there should be major differences in the processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces because various components (face recognition units; person identity nodes; name generation) are involved only when processing familiar faces. Thus, it is much easier to recognise familiar faces, espe- cially when faces are seen from an unusual angle. Second, separate processing routes are involved in working out facial identity (who is it?) and facial expression (what is he/she feeling?). The former processing route (includ- ing the occipital face area and the fusiform face area) focuses on relatively unchanging aspects of faces, whereas the latter (involving the superior temporal sulcus) deals with more changeable aspects. This separation between processes responsible for recognising identity and expression makes sense – if there were no separation, we would have great prob- lems recognising familiar faces with unusual expressions (Young, 2018). Third, when we see a familiar face, famil- iarity information from the face recognition unit should be accessed first. This is followed by information about that person (e.g., occu- pation) from the person identity node and then that person’s name from the name gen- eration component. As a result, we can find a face familiar while unable to recall anything else about that person, or we can recall personal information about a person while being unable to recall their name. However, a face should never lead to recall of the person’s name in the absence of other information. Fourth, the model assumes face processing involves several stages. This implies the nature of face-processing impairments in brain-damaged patients depends on which stages of processing are impaired. Davies- Thompson et al. (2014) developed the model to account for three forms of face impairment (see Figure 3.20). Findings According to the model, it is easier to recognise familiar faces than unfamil- iar ones for various reasons. Of special importance, we possess much more structural information about familiar faces. This structural information Figure 3.19 The model of face recognition put forward by Bruce and Young (1986).

However, the differences in ease of recognition between familiar and unfamiliar faces are greater than envisaged by Bruce and Young (1986). Jenkins et al. (2011) found 40 face photographs showing only two different unfamiliar individuals were thought to show almost four times that number (discussed on p. 124). The two individuals were actually two Dutch celebri- ties almost unknown in Britain. When Jenkins et al. (2011) repeated their experiment with Dutch participants, nearly all performed the task perfectly because the faces were so familiar. Why is unfamiliar face recognition so difficult? There is considerable within-person variability in facial images, which is why different photo- graphs of the same unfamiliar individual often look as if they come from different individuals (Young & Burton, 2017, 2018). Jenkins and Burton (2011) argued we could improve identification of unfamiliar faces by aver- aging across several photographs of the same individual and so greatly reducing image variability. Their findings supported this prediction. Burton et al. (2016) shed additional light on the complexities of rec- ognising unfamiliar faces. In essence, how one person’s face varies across images differs from how someone else’s face varies. Thus, the characteris- tics that vary or remain constant across images differ from one individual to another. Figure 3.20 Damage to regions of the inferior occipito-temporal cortex (including fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA)) is associated with apperceptive prosopagnosia (blue); damage to anterior inferior temporal cortex (aLT) is associated with associative prosopagnosia (red); and damage to the anterior temporal pole is associated with person-specific amnesia (green).

There is some support for this prediction. Fox et al. (2011) found patients with damage to the face-recognition network had impaired identity perception but not expres- sion perception. In contrast, a patient with damage to the superior tem- poral sulcus had impaired expression perception but reasonably intact identity perception. Sliwinska and Pitcher (2018) confirmed the role played by the superior temporal sulcus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) applied to this area impaired recognition of facial expression. However, the two routes are not entirely independent. Judgements of facial expression are strongly influenced by irrelevant identity information (Schweinberger & Soukup, 1998). Redfern and Benton (2017) asked partic- ipants to sort cards of faces into piles, one for each perceived identity. One pack contained expressive faces and the other neutral faces. With expres- sive faces, faces belonging to different individuals were more likely to be placed in the same pile. Thus, expressive facial information can influence (and impair) identity perception. Fitousi and Wenger (2013) asked participants to respond positively to a face that had a given identity and emotion (e.g., a happy face belonging to Kiera Knightley). Facial identity and facial expression were not pro- cessed independently although they should have been according to the model. Another issue is that the facial expression route is more complex than assumed theoretically. For example, damage to the amygdala produces greater deficits in recognising fear and anger than other emotions (Calder & Young, 2005). Young and Bruce (2011) admitted they had not expected deficits in emotion recognition in faces to vary across emotions. The third prediction is that we always retrieve personal information (e.g., occupation) about a person before recalling their name. Young et al. (1985) asked people to record problems they experienced in face recogni- tion. There were 1,008 such incidents but people never reported putting a name to a face while knowing nothing else about that person. In con- trast, there were 190 occasions on which someone remembered a reason- able amount of information about a person but not their name (also as predicted by the model). Several other findings support the third prediction (Hanley, 2011). However, the notion that names are always recalled after personal infor- mation is too rigid. Calderwood and Burton (2006) asked fans of the television series Friends to recall the name or occupation of the main char- acters when shown their faces. Names were recalled faster than occupa- tions (against the model’s prediction). Fourth, we relate face-processing impairments to Bruce and Young’s (1986) serial stage model. We consider three such impairments (discussed by Davies-Thompson et al., 2014; see Figure 3.20) with reference to Figure 3.19: (1) Patients with impaired early stages of face processing: such patients (categorised as having apperceptive prosopagnosia) have “an inability to form a sufficiently accurate representation of the face’s structure from visual data” (Davies-Thompson et al., 2014, p. 161). As a result, faces are often not recognised as familiar.

(3) Patients with impaired access to biographical information stored in person identity nodes: such patients have person-specific amnesia and differ from those with associative prosopagnosia because they often cannot recognise other people by any cues (including spoken names or voices). So far we have applied Bruce and Young’s (1986) model to acquired prosop- agnosia. However, we can also apply the model to developmental prosop- agnosia (in which face-recognition mechanisms fail to develop normally). Parketny et al. (2015) presented previously unfamiliar faces to develop- mental prosopagnosics and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while they performed an easy face-recognition task. They focused on three ERP components: (1) N170: this early component (about 170 ms) reflects processes involved in perceptual structural face processing. (2) N250: this component (about 250 ms) reflects a match between a pre- sented face and a stored face representation. (3) P600: this component (about 600 ms) reflects attentional processes associated with face recognition. What did Parketny et al. (2015) find? Recognition times were 150 ms slower in the developmental prosopagnosics than healthy controls. N170 was broadly similar in both groups with respect to timing and magnitude. N250 was 40 ms slower in the prosopagnosics than controls but of comparable magnitude. Finally, P600 was significantly smaller in the prosopagnosics than controls and was delayed by 80 ms. In sum, developmental prosop- agnosics show relatively intact early face processing but are slower and less efficient later in processing. ERPs provide an effective way of identifying those aspects of face processing adversely affected in prosopagnosia. Evaluation Bruce and Young (1986) provided a comprehensive framework emphasis- ing the wide range of information that can be extracted from faces. It was remarkably innovative in identifying the major processes and structures involved in face processing and recognition and incorporating them within a plausible serial stage approach. Finally, the model enhanced our understand- ing of why familiar faces are much easier to recognise than unfamiliar ones. What are the model’s limitations? First, the complexities involved in recognising unfamiliar faces (e.g., coping with the great variability in a given individual’s facial images) were not fully acknowledged. As Young and Burton (2017, p. 213) pointed out, it was several years after 1986 before researchers appreciated that “humans’ relatively poor performance at unfamiliar-face recognition is as much a problem of perception as of memory”.

Case study: Model of face processing Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14.\n\n130 Visual perception and attention Second, the model’s account of the processing of facial expression is oversimplified. For example, the processing of facial expression is less independent of the processing of facial identity than assumed theoretically. According to the model, damage to the expression analysis component should produce impaired ability to recognise all facial expressions. In fact, many brain-damaged patients have much greater impairment in facial rec- ognition of some emotions than others (Young, 2018). Third, the model was somewhat vague about the precise information stored in the face recognition units and the person identity nodes. Fourth, it was wrong to exclude gaze perception from the model because it pro- vides useful information about what an observer is attending to (Young & Bruce, 2011). Fifth, Bruce and Young (1986) focused on general factors influencing face recognition. However, as discussed earlier, there are sub- stantial individual differences in face-recognition ability with a few indi- viduals (super-recognisers) having outstanding ability. These individual differences depend mostly on genetic factors (Wilmer, 2017) not considered within the model. VISUAL IMAGERY Close your eyes and imagine the face of someone you know very well. What did you experience? Many people claim forming visual images is like “seeing with the mind’s eye”, suggesting there are important similarities between imagery and perception. Mental imagery is typically regarded as involving conscious experience. However, we could also regard imagery as a form of mental representation (an internal cognitive symbol representing aspects of external reality) (e.g., Pylyshyn, 2002). We would not necessarily be consciously aware of images as mental representations. Galton (1883) supported the above viewpoint. He found many indi- viduals reported no conscious imagery when imagining a definite object (e.g., their breakfast table). Zeman et al. (2015) studied several individu- als lacking visual imagery and coined the term aphantasia to refer to this condition. If visual imagery and perception are similar, why do we very rarely confuse them? One reason is that we are generally aware of deliberately constructing images (unlike with visual perception). Another reason is that images contain much less detail. For example, people rate their visual images of faces as similar to photographs lacking sharp edges and borders (Harvey, 1986). However, many people sometimes confuse visual imagery and perception. Consider hallucinations in which perception-like experiences occur in the absence of the appropriate environmental stimulus. Visual hallucinations occur in approximately 27% of schizophrenic patients but also in 7% of the general population. Waters et al. (2014) discussed research showing visual hallucinations in schizophrenics are often associ- ated with activity in the primary visual cortex, suggesting hallucinations involve many processes associated with visual perception. One reason schizophrenics are susceptible to visual hallucinations is because of dis- tortions in top-down processing (e.g., forming strong expectations of what they will see). KEY TERMS Aphantasia The inability to form mental images of objects when those objects are not present. Hallucinations Perceptual experiences that appear real even though the individuals or objects perceived are not present.

Goldenberg et al. (1995) described a patient whose primary visual cortex had been nearly wholly destroyed. Nevertheless, she generated such vivid visual images that she mistook them for genuine visual perception. The brain damage in patients with Anton’s syndrome typically includes large parts of the visual cortex (Gandhi et al., 2016). There is also Charles Bonnet syndrome, defined as “consistent or periodic complex visual hallucinations that occur in visually impaired individuals” (Yacoub & Ferrucci, 2011, p. 421). However, patients are generally aware the hallucinations are not real and so they are actually pseudo-hallucinations. When patients hallucinate, they have increased activity in brain areas specialised for visual processing (e.g., hallucinations in colour are associated with activity in colour-processing areas) (ffytche et al., 1998). Painter et al. (2018) identified a major reason for this elevated activity. Stimuli presented to intact regions of the retina cause extreme excitability (hyperexcitability) within early visual cortex. Visually impaired individuals with hallucinations show greater hyperexcitability than those without. Why is visual imagery useful? What functions are served by visual imagery? According to Moulton and Kosslyn (2009, p. 1274), visual imagery “allows us to answer ‘what if’ ques- tions by making explicit and accessible the likely consequences of being in a specific situation or performing a specific action”. For example, profes- sional golfers use mental imagery to predict what would happen if they hit a certain shot. Pearson and Kosslyn (2015) pointed out that many visual images contain rich information that is accessible when required. For example, what is the shape of a cat’s ears? You may be able to answer the question by constructing a visual image. More generally, visual imagery supports numerous cognitive functions. These include creative insight, attentional search, guiding deliberate action, short-term memory storage and long-term memory retrieval (Mitchell & Cusack, 2016). Imagery theories Kosslyn (e.g., 1994; Pearson & Kosslyn, 2015) proposed an influential theory based on the assumption that visual imagery resembles visual per- ception. It was originally called perceptual anticipation theory because image generation involves processes used to anticipate perceiving visual stimuli. According to the theory, visual images are depictive representations. What is a depictive representation? In such a depiction, “each part of the representation corresponds to a part of the represented object such that the distances among the parts in the representation correspond to the actual distances among the parts” (Pearson & Kosslyn, 2015, p. 10089). Thus, for example, a visual image of a desk with a computer on top and a cat KEY TERMS Anton’s syndrome A condition found in some blind people in which they misinterpret their visual imagery as visual perception.

Where are depictive representations formed? Kosslyn argued they are created in early visual cortex (BA17 and BA18; see Figure 3.21) within a visual buffer. The visual buffer is a short-term store for visual infor- mation only and is of major importance in visual perception and imagery. There is also an “attention window” selecting some visual information in the visual buffer and passing it on to other brain areas for further process- ing. This attention window is flexible – it can be adjusted to include more, or less, visual information. Processing in the visual buffer depends primarily on external stimulation during per- ception. However, such processing involves non-pictorial information stored in long-term memory during imagery. Shape information is stored in the inferior temporal lobe whereas spatial representations are stored in posterior parietal cortex (see Figure 3.21). In sum, visual percep- tion mostly involves bottom-up processing whereas visual imagery depends on top-down processing. Pylyshyn (e.g., 2002) argued visual imagery differs substantially from visual perception. According to his propositional theory, performance on mental imagery tasks does not involve depictive or pictorial representa- tions. Instead, it involves tacit knowledge (knowledge inaccessible to con- scious awareness). Tacit knowledge is “Knowledge of what things would look like to subjects in situations like the ones in which they are to imagine themselves” (Pylyshyn, 2002, p. 161). Thus, performance on an imagery task relies on relevant stored knowledge rather than visual images. Within this theoretical framework, it is improbable that early visual cortex would be involved on an imagery task. Imagery resembles perception If visual perception and imagery involve similar processes, they should influence each other. There should be facilitation if the contents of percep- tion and imagery are the same but interference if they differ. Pearson et al. (2008) reported a facilitation effect with binocular rivalry – when a different stimulus is presented to each eye, only one is consciously perceived at any given moment. The act of imagining a specific pattern strongly influenced which stimulus was subsequently perceived and this facilitation depended on the similarity between the imagined and presented stimuli. The findings were remarkably similar when the initial stimulus was perceived rather than imagined. Baddeley and Andrade (2000) reported an interference effect. Participants rated the vividness of visual and auditory images while per- forming a second task involving visual/spatial processes. This task reduced KEY TERMS Visual buffer Within Kosslyn’s theory, a short-term visual memory store involved in visual imagery and perception. Binocular rivalry When two different visual stimuli are presented one to each eye, only one stimulus is seen; the seen stimulus alternates over time.

Laeng et al. (2014) asked participants to view pictures of animals and to follow each one by forming a visual image of that animal. There was a striking similarity in eye fixations devoted to the various areas of each picture in both conditions (see Fig. 3.22). Participants having the greatest similarity in dwell time between perception and imagery showed the best memory for the size of each animal. According to Kosslyn’s theoretical position, much processing associ- ated with visual imagery occurs in early visual cortex (BA17 and BA18) plus several other areas. In a review, Kosslyn and Thompson (2003) found 50% of studies using visual-imagery tasks reported activation in early visual cortex. Significant findings were most likely when the task involved inspecting the fine details of images or focusing on an object’s shape. In a meta-analysis (see Glossary), Winlove et al. (2018) found the early visual cortex (V1) was typically activated during visual imagery. Consistent with Kosslyn’s theory, activation in the early visual cortex is greater among individuals reporting vivid visual imagery. The neuroimaging evidence discussed above is limited – it is correla- tional and so the activation associated with visual imagery may not be directly relevant to the images that are formed. Naselaris et al. (2015) reported more convincing evidence. Participants formed images of five art- works. It was possible to some extent to identify the imagined artworks from hundreds of other artworks through careful analysis of activity in the early visual cortex. Some of this activity corresponded to the processing of low-level visual features (e.g., space; orientation). Figure 3.22 Dwell time for the four quadrants of a picture during perception and imagery.

(2017a). They found “the overlap in neural representations between imagery and perception . . . extends beyond the visual cortex to include also parietal and premotor/ frontal areas” (p. 1372). Of most importance, the greater the neural overlap between imagery and perception throughout the entire visual system, the more vivid was the imagery experience.

Then close your eyes, mentally rotate the image by 90o clockwise and decide what you see. Then repeat the exercise with the other objects. Finally, rotate the book through 90o. You probably found it very easy to identify the objects when perceiving them but impossible when only imagin- ing rotating them. Slezak (1991, 1995) used stimuli closely resembling those in Figure 3.23 and found no observers reported seeing the objects. Thus, the information within images is much less detailed and flexible than visual information. Lee et al. (2012) identified important differences between imagery and perception. Observers viewed or imagined common objects (e.g., car; umbrella) while activity in the early visual cortex and areas associated with later visual processing (object-selective regions) was assessed. Attempts were made by the researchers to identify the objects being imagined or perceived on the basis of activation in those areas. What did Lee et al. (2012) find? First, activation in all brain areas was considerably greater when participants perceived rather than imagined objects. Second, objects being perceived or imagined were identified with above-chance accuracy based on patterns of brain acti- vation except for imagined objects in the primary visual cortex (V1; see Figure 3.24). Third, the success rate in identifying per- ceived objects was greater based on brain acti- vation in areas associated with early visual processing than those associated with later processing. However, the opposite was the case with imagined objects (see Figure 3.24). Thus, object processing in the early visual cortex is very limited during imagery but is extremely important during perception. Imagery for objects depends mostly on top-down pro- cesses based on object knowledge rather than processing in the early visual cortex. Most cognitive neuroscience research has focused on the brain areas activated during visual perception and imagery. It is also important to focus on connectivity between brain areas. Dijkstra et al. (2017b) considered connectivity among four brain areas of central importance in perception and imagery: early Figure 3.23 Slezak (1991, 1995) asked participants to memorise one of the above images. They then imagined rotating the image 90 degrees clockwise and reported what they saw. None of them reported seeing the figures that can be seen clearly if you rotate the page by 90 degrees clockwise.

However, there is much stronger top-down connectivity during imagery to compensate for the absence of bottom-up connectivity. Individuals having the greatest top- down connectivity during imagery reported the most vivid images. Dijkstra et al. (2018) studied the time course for the development of visual representations in perception and in imagery using magneto- encephalography (MEG; see Glossary). With perception, they confirmed that visual representations develop through a series of processing stages (see Chapter 2). With imagery, in contrast, the entire visual representation appeared to be activated simultaneously, presumably because all the rele- vant information was retrieved together from memory. Brain damage If visual perception and visual imagery involve the same mechanisms, we might expect brain damage to have comparable effects on perception and imagery. That is often the case. However, there are numerous exceptions (Bartolomeo, 2002, 2008). Moro et al. (2008) studied two brain-damaged patients with intact visual perception but impaired visual imagery. They were both very poor at drawing objects from memory but could copy the same objects when shown a drawing. These patients (and others with impaired visual imagery but intact visual perception) have damage to the left temporal lobe. Visual images are probably generated from information about concepts (including objects) stored in the temporal lobes (Patterson et al., 2007). However, this genera- tion process is less important for visual perception. Bridge et al. (2012) studied a young man, SBR, who had virtually no primary visual cortex and nearly total blindness. However, he had vivid visual imagery and his pattern of cortical activation when engaged in visual imagery resembled that of healthy controls. Similar findings were reported with a 70-year-old woman, SH, who became blind at the age of 27. She had intact visual imagery predominantly involving areas outside the early visual cortex. Of relevance, she had greater connectivity between some visual networks in the brain than most individuals. How can we interpret the above findings? Visual perception mostly involves bottom-up processes triggered by the stimulus whereas visual imagery primarily involves top-down processes based on object knowledge. Thus, it is unsurprising brain areas involved in early visual processing are more important for perception than imagery whereas brain areas associ- ated with storage of information about visual objects are more important for imagery. Evaluation Much progress has been made in understanding the relationship between visual imagery and visual perception. Similar processes are involved in imagery and perception and they are both associated with somewhat similar patterns of brain activity. In addition, the predicted facilitatory and interfering effects between imagery and perception tasks have been reported. These findings are more consistent with Kosslyn’s theory than Pylyshyn’s.

For example, there is the neuroimag- ing evidence reported by Lee et al. (2012) and the frequent dissociations between perception and imagery found in brain-damaged patients. Of most importance, visual perception involves strong bottom-up connectivity and weak top-down connectivity, whereas visual imagery involves very strong top-down connectivity but negligible bottom-up connectivity (Dijkstra et al., 2017b). CHAPTER SUMMARY • Pattern recognition. Pattern recognition involves processing of specific features and global processing. Feature processing generally (but not always) precedes global processing. Several types of cells (e.g., simple cells; complex cells; end-stopped cells) are involved in feature processing. There are complexities in pattern recognition due to interactions among cells and the influence of top-down processes. Evidence from computer programs to solve CAPTCHAs suggests humans are very good at processing edge corners. Fingerprint identification is sometimes very accurate; however, even experts show confirmation bias (distorted performance caused by contextual information). Fingerprint experts are much better than novices at discriminating between matches and non-matches and also adopt a more conservative response bias. • Perceptual organisation. The gestaltists proposed several principles of perceptual grouping and emphasised the importance of figure-ground segmentation. They argued that perceptual grouping and figure-ground segregation depend on innate factors. They also argued we perceive the simplest possible organisation of the visual field. The gestaltists provided descriptions rather than explanations. Their approach underestimated the complex interactions of factors underlying perceptual organisation. The gestaltists de-emphasised the role of experience and learning in perceptual organisation. However, recent theories based on Bayesian inference (e.g., the Bayesian hierarchical grouping model) have emphasised learning processes and fully acknowledge the importance of learning. • Approaches to object recognition. Visual processing typically involves a coarse-to-fine processing sequence: low spatial frequen- cies in visual input (associated with coarse processing) are conveyed to higher visual areas faster than high spatial frequencies (associ- ated with fine processing). Biederman assumed in his recognition- by-components theory that objects consist of geons (basic shapes). An object’s geons are determined by edge-extraction processes and the resultant geon-based description is viewpoint-invariant. Biederman’s theory de-emphasises the role of top-down processes.

Object representations often contain viewpoint-dependent and viewpoint-invariant information. • Object recognition: top-down processes. Top-down processes are more important in object recognition when observers view degraded or briefly presented stimuli. Top- down processes sometimes influence attention, memory or response bias rather than perception itself. However, there are also direct effects of top-down processes on object recognition. According to the interactive-iterative framework (Baruch et al., 2018), top-down and bottom-up processes interact with top-down processes (e.g., attention) influencing subsequent bottom-up processing. • Face recognition. Face recognition involves more holistic processing than object recognition. Deficient holistic processing partly explains why prosopagnosic patients have much greater problems with face recognition than object recognition. Face processing involves a brain network including the fusiform face and occipital face areas. However, much of this network is also used in processing other objects (especially when recognising objects for which we have expertise). Bruce and Young’s model assumes several serial processing stages. Research on prosopagnosics supports this assumption because the precise nature of their face-recognition impairments depends on which stage(s) are most affected. The model also assumes there are major differences in the processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. This assumption has received substantial support. However, Bruce and Young did not fully appreciate that unfamiliar faces are hard to recognise because of the great variability of any given individual’s facial images. The model assumes there are two independent processing routes (for facial expression and facial identity), but they are not entirely independent. The model ignores the role played by genetic factors in accounting for individual differences in face-recognition ability. • Visual imagery. Visual imagery allows us to predict the visual consequences of performing certain actions. According to Kosslyn’s perceptual anticipation theory, visual imagery closely resembles visual perception. In contrast, Pylyshyn, in his propositional theory, argued visual imagery involves making use of tacit knowledge and does not resemble visual perception. Visual imagery and perception influence each other as predicted by Kosslyn’s theory.

However, areas involved in top-down processing (e.g., left temporal lobe) are more important in imagery than perception, and areas involved in bottom-up processing (e.g., early visual cortex) are more important in perception.

What was missing (but is an overarching theme of this chapter) is the time dimension. In the real world, we move around and/or people or objects in the environ- ment move. The resulting changes in the visual information available to us are very useful in ensuring we perceive the environment accurately and also respond appropriately. This emphasis on change and movement necessarily leads to a consideration of the relationship between perception and action. In sum, our focus in this chapter is on how we process (and respond to) a constantly changing environment. The first theme addressed in this chapter is the perception of move- ment. This includes our ability to move successfully within the visual envi- ronment and predict accurately when moving objects will reach us. The second theme is concerned with more complex issues – how do we act appropriately on the environment and the objects within it? Of rel- evance are theories (e.g., the perception-action theory; the dual- process approach) distinguishing between processes and systems involved in vision- for- perception and those involved in vision-for-action (see Chapter 2). Here we consider theories providing more detailed accounts of vision-for- action and/or the workings of the dorsal pathways allegedly underlying vision-for-action. The third theme focuses on the processes involved in making sense of moving objects (especially other people). It thus differs from the first theme in which moving stimuli are considered mostly in terms of predicting when they will reach us. There is an emphasis on the perception of biolog- ical movement when the available visual information is impoverished. We also consider the role of the mirror neuron system in interpreting human movement. Finally, we consider our ability (or failure!) to detect changes in objects within the visual environment over time. Unsurprisingly, attention importantly determines which aspects of the environment are consciously Chapter 4 Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:41.","evidence":["provides a very interesting account of theory and research on face perception.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:14."]}

This issue provides a useful bridge between the areas of visual perception and attention (the subject of the next chapter). DIRECT PERCEPTION James Gibson (1950, 1966, 1979) put forward a radical approach to visual perception that was largely ignored at the time. Until approximately 40 years ago, it was assumed the main purpose of visual perception is to allow us to identify or recognise objects. This typically involves relating infor- mation extracted from the visual environment to our stored knowledge of objects (see Chapter 3). Gibson argued that this approach is limited – in evolutionary terms, vision developed so our ancestors could respond rapidly to the environment (e.g., hunting animals; escaping from danger). Gibson (1979, p. 239) argued that perception involves “keeping in touch with the environment”. This is sufficient for most purposes because the information provided by environmental stimuli is much richer than previously believed. We can relate Gibson’s views to Milner and Goodale’s (1995, 2008) vision-for-action system (see Chapter 2). According to both theoretical accounts, there is an intimate relationship between perception and action. Gibson regarded his theoretical approach as ecological. He emphasised that perception facilitates interactions between the individual and their environment. Here is the essence of his direct theory of perception: When I assert that perception of the environment is direct, I mean that it is not mediated by retinal pictures, neural pictures, or mental pic- tures. Direct perception is the activity of getting information from the ambient array of light. I call this a process of information pickup that involves . . . looking around, getting around, and looking at things. (Gibson, 1979, p. 147) We will briefly consider some of Gibson’s theoretical assumptions: ● The pattern of light reaching the eye is an optic array. It contains all the visual information from the environment striking the eye. ● The optic array provides unambiguous or invariant information about the layout of objects. This information comes in many forms including optic flow patterns and affordances (see below) and texture gradients (discussed in Chapter 2). Gibson produced training films in the Second World War describing how pilots handle taking off and landing. Of crucial importance is optic flow – the changes in the pattern of light reaching observers when they move or parts of the visual environment move. When pilots approach a landing strip, the point towards which they are moving (focus of expansion) appears motionless with the rest of the visual environment apparently moving away from that point (see Figure 4.1). The further away any part of the landing strip is from that point, the greater is its apparent speed of movement. Wang et al. (2012) simulated the pattern of optic flow that would be experienced if individuals moved forwards in a stationary environment. KEY TERMS Optic array The structural pattern of light falling on the retina. Optic flow The changes in the pattern of light reaching an observer when there is movement of the observer and/or aspects of the environment. Focus of expansion The point towards which someone in motion is moving; it does not appear to move.

(More is said later about optic flow and the focus of expansion.) Gibson (1966, 1979) argued certain higher-order characteristics of the visual array (invariants) remain unaltered as observers move around their environment. Invariants (e.g., the focus of expansion) are important because they remain the same over different viewing angles. The focus of expansion is an invariant feature of the optic array. Affordances According to Gibson (1979), the potential uses of objects (their affordances) are directly perceivable. For example, a ladder “affords” ascent or descent. Gibson believed that “affordances are opportunities for action that exist in the environment and do not depend on the animal’s mind . . . they do not cause behaviour but simply make it possible” (Withagen et al., 2012, p. 251). In Gibson (1979, p. 127), affordances are what the environment “offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes”. Evidence for the affordance of “climbability” of steps varying in height was reported by Di Stasi and Guardini (2007). The step height judged the most “climbable” was the one that would have involved the minimum expenditure of energy. Gibson argued an object’s affordances are perceived directly or auto- matically. In support, Pappas and Mack (2008) found images of objects presented below the level of conscious awareness nevertheless produced motor priming. For example, the image of a hammer caused activation in brain areas involved in preparing to use a hammer. Wilf et al. (2013) focused on the affordance of graspability with participants lifting their arms to perform a reach-like movement with graspable and non-graspable objects (see Figure 4.2). Muscle activity started faster for graspable than non-graspable objects suggesting that the affordance of graspability trig- gers rapid activity in the motor system.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:41.\n\nMotion perception and action 143 Gibson’s approach to affordances is substantially oversimplified. For example, an apparently simple task such as cutting up a tomato involves selecting an appropriate tool, deciding on how to grasp and manipulate the tool, and monitoring movement execution (Osiurak & Badets, 2016). In other words, “People reason about physical object properties to solve everyday life activities” (Osiurak & Badets, 2016, p. 540). This is sharply different to Gibson’s emphasis on the ease and immediacy of tool use. When individuals observe a tool, Gibson assumed this provided them with direct access to knowledge about how to manipulate it and this manipulation knowledge gave access to the tool’s functions. This assump- tion exaggerates the importance of manipulation knowledge. For example, Figure 4.2 Graspable and non- graspable objects having similar asymmetrical features. From Wilf et al. (2013).

Finally, Gibson argued stored knowledge is not required for individuals to make appropriate movements with respect to objects (e.g., tools). In fact, individuals often make extensive use of motor and function knowledge when dealing with objects (Osiurak & Badets, 2016). For example, making tea involves filling the kettle with water, boiling the water, finding some milk and so on. Foulsham (2015) discussed research showing there are only small individual differences in the pattern of eye fixations when people make tea. Such findings strongly imply they use stored information about the sequence of motor actions involved in tea-making. Evaluation What are the strengths of Gibson’s ecological approach? First, “Gibson’s realisation that natural scenes are the ecologically valid stimulus that should be used for the study of vision was of fundamental importance” (Bruce & Tadmor, 2015, p. 32). Second, and related to the first point, Gibson disagreed with the previ- ous emphasis on static observers looking at static visual displays. Foulsham and Kingstone (2017) compared the eye fixations of participants walking around a university campus with those of other participants viewing static pictures of the same scene. The eye fixations were significantly different: those engaged in walking focused more on features (e.g., the path) impor- tant for locomotion whereas those viewing static pictures focused centrally within each picture. Third, Gibson was far ahead of his time. There is support for two visual systems (Milner & Goodale, 1995, 2008; see Chapter 2): a vision- for- perception system and a vision-for-action system. Before Gibson, the major emphasis was on the former. In contrast, he argued our percep- tual system allows us to respond rapidly and accurately to environmental stimuli without using memory, which is a feature of the latter system. What are the limitations of Gibson’s approach? First, Gibson attempted to specify the visual information used to guide action but ignored many of the processes involved (see Chapters 2 and 3). For example, Gibson assumed the perception of invariants occurred almost “automatically”, but it actually requires several complex processes. Second, Gibson’s argument that we do not need to assume the existence of internal representations (e.g., object knowledge) is flawed. The logic of Gibson’s position is that: “There are invariants specifying a friend’s face, a performance of Hamlet, or the sinking of the Titanic, and no knowledge of the friend, of the play, or of maritime history is required to perceive these things” (Bruce et al., 2003, p. 410). Evidence refuting Gibson’s argument was reviewed by Foulsham (2015; discussed above). Third, and related to the second point, Gibson de-emphasised the role of top-down processes (based on our knowledge and expectations) in visual perception. Such processes are especially important when the visual input is impoverished (see Chapter 3). Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:41.","evidence":[".","Reprinted with permission."]}

Created from usyd on 2022-02-13 13:26:41.\n\nMotion perception and action 145 Fourth, Gibson’s views on the effects of motion on perception were oversimplified. For example, when moving towards a goal, we use more information sources than Gibson assumed (discussed below). VISUALLY GUIDED MOVEMENT From an ecological perspective, it is important to understand how we move around the environment. For example, what information do we use when walking towards our current goal or target? We must ensure we are not hit by cars when crossing the road and when driving we must avoid hitting other cars. Playing tennis well involves predicting exactly when and where the ball will strike our racquet. The ways visual perception plays a crucial role in facilitating our locomotion and ensuring our safety are discussed in the next section. Heading and steering When we want to reach some goal (e.g., a gate at the end of a field), we use visual information to move directly towards it. Gibson (1950) empha- sised the importance of optic flow (see Glossary; discussed on pp. 141–142). When we move forwards in a straight line, the point towards which we are moving (the focus of expansion) appears motionless. In contrast, the area around that point seems to expand. Gibson (1950) proposed a hypothesis, according to which, if we are not moving directly towards our goal, we use the focus of expansion and optic flow to bring our heading (point of expansion) into alignment with our goal. This is known as the global radial outflow hypothesis. Gibson’s approach works well in principle when applied to an indi- vidual trying to move straight from A to B. However, matters are more complex when we cannot move directly to our goal (e.g., driving around a bend in the road; avoiding obstacles). Another complexity is that observers often make head and eye movements. In sum, the retinal flow field (changes in the pattern of light on the retina) is influenced by rotation in the retinal image produced by following a curved path and/or eye and head movements. The above complexities mean it is often hard to use information from retinal flow to determine our direction of heading. It has often been claimed that a copy of motor commands (preprogramming) to move the eye and head (efference copy) is used by observers to compensate for the effects of eye and head movements on the retinal image. However, Feldman (2016) argued this approach is insufficient on its own because it de-emphasises the brain’s active involvement in relating perception and action. Findings: heading Gibson emphasised the role of optic flow in allowing individuals to move directly towards their goal. Relevant information includes the focus of expansion (see Glossary) and the direction of radial motion (e.g., expan- sion within optic flow). Strong et al. (2017) obtained evidence indicating the importance of both factors and also established they depend on separate brain areas. More specifically, they used transcranial magnetic stimulation KEY TERMS Retinal flow field The changing patterns of light on the retina produced by movement of the observer relative to the environment as well as by eye and head movements.

TMS applied to area V3A impaired perception of the focus of expansion but not direction of radial motion, with the opposite pattern being obtained when TMS was applied to the motion area V5/MT+ (see Chapter 2). As indicated above, eye and/or head movements make it harder to use optic flow effectively for heading. Bremmer et al. (2010) considered this issue in macaque monkeys presented with distorted visual flow fields sim- ulating the combined effects of self-motion and an eye movement. Their key finding was that numerous cells in the medial superior temporal area successfully compensated for this distortion. According to Gibson, a walker tries to make the focus of expansion coincide with the body moving straight ahead. If a walker wore prisms producing a 9° error in their perceived visual direction, the focus of expan- sion should be misaligned compared to their expectation. As a result, there should be a correction process, a prediction confirmed by Herlihey and Rushton (2012). Also as predicted, walkers denied access to information about retinal motion failed to show any correction. Factors additional to the optic flow information emphasised by Gibson are also used when making heading judgements. This is unsurprising given the typical richness of the available environmental information. van den Berg and Brenner (1994) noted we only require one eye to use optic flow information. However, they discovered heading judgements were more accurate when observers used both eyes. Binocular disparity (see Glossary) in the two-eye condition provided useful additional information about the relative depths of objects. Cormack et al. (2017) introduced the notion of a binoptic flow field to describe the 3-D information available to observers (but de-emphasised by Gibson). Gibson assumed optic-flow patterns generated by self-motion are of fundamental importance when we head towards a goal. However, motion is not essential for accurate perception of heading. The judgements of heading direction made by observers viewing two static photographs of a real-world scene in rapid succession were reasonably accurate in the absence of optic- flow information (Hahn et al., 2003). These findings can be explained in terms of retinal displacement – objects closer to the direction of heading show less retinal displacement as we move closer to the target. Snyder and Bischof (2010) argued that information about the direction of heading is provided by two systems. One system uses movement infor- mation (e.g., optic flow) rapidly and fairly automatically (as proposed by Gibson). The other system uses displacement information more slowly and requires greater processing resources. It follows that performing a second task at the same time as making judgements about direction of heading should have little effect on those judgements if movement information is available. In contrast, a second task should impair heading judgements when only displacement information is available. The evidence supported both predictions.

With curved paths, path judge- ments (identifying future points along one’s path) were much more accurate than heading judgements. According to the above analysis, we might expect individuals (e.g., drivers) to fixate some point along their future path when it is curved. This is the future path strategy. In contrast, Land and Lee (1994) argued (with supportive evidence) that drivers approaching a bend focus on the tangent point – the point on the inside edge of the road at which its direction appears to reverse (see Figure 4.3). The tangent point has two potential advantages. First, it is easy to identify and track. Second, road curvature can easily be worked out by considering the angle between the direction of heading and the tangent point. Kandil et al. (2009) found most drivers nego- tiating 270° bends at a motorway junction fixated the tangent point much more often than the future path (75% vs 14%, respectively). Other research suggests the tangent point is less important. For example, Itkonen et al. (2015) instructed drivers to “drive as they normally would” or “look at the tangent point”. Eye movements differed markedly in the two conditions – drivers were much more likely to fixate points along the future path in the former condition. How can we interpret the above appar- ently inconsistent findings? Lappi et al. (2013) hypothesised drivers often fixate the tangent point when approaching and entering a bend but fixate the future path further into the bend. They argued the tangent point provides relatively precise informa- tion and so drivers use it when uncertainty about the precise nature of the curve or bend is maximal (i.e., when approaching and entering it). Lappi et al. (2013) obtained supporting evidence for the above hypoth- esis. Drivers’ fixations while driving along a lengthy curve formed by the slip road to a motorway were predominantly on the path ahead rather than the tangent point after the first few seconds (see short clips of drivers’ eye movements while performing this task at 10.1371/journal.pone.0068326). The evidence discussed so far does not rule out optic flow as a factor influencing drivers’ steering. Mole et al. (2016) manipulated optic-flow speed in a simulated driving situation. This produced steering errors (understeering or oversteering) when going around bends even when full information about road edges was available. Thus, optic flow influenced driving performance.

The tangent point is marked by the filled circle on the inside edge of the road, and the desired future path is shown by the dotted line.

Such information is especially useful when individuals can move directly towards their goal rather than following a curved or indirect path. Indeed, the evidence suggests optic flow is often IN THE REAL WORLD: ON-ROAD DRIVING Much research on drivers’ gaze patterns lacks ecological validity (see Glossary). Drivers are typ- ically in a simulator and the environment through which they drive is somewhat oversimplified. Accordingly, Lappi et al. (2017) studied the gaze patterns of a 43-year-old male driving school instructor driving on a rural road in Finland. His eye movements revealed a more complex picture than most previous research. What did Lappi et al. (2017) discover? Here are four major findings: (1) The driver’s gaze shifted very frequently from one feature of the visual environment to another and he made many head movements. (2) The driver’s gaze was predominantly on the far road (see Figure 4.4). This preview of the road ahead allowed him to make use of anticipatory control. (3) In bends, the driver’s gaze was mostly within the far road “triangle” formed by the tangent point (TP), the lane edge opposite the TP and the occlusion point (OP; the point where the road disappears from view). In general terms, the OP is used to anticipate the road ahead whereas the TP is used for more immediate compensatory steering control. (4) The driver fixated specific targets (e.g., traffic signs; other road users) very rapidly, suggesting his peripheral vision was very efficient. In sum, drivers’ gaze patterns are more complex than implied by previous research. Drivers do not constantly fixate any given feature (e.g., tangent point) passively. Instead, they “sample visual infor- mation as needed, leading to input that is intermittent, and determined by the active observer . . . rather than imposed by the environment” (Lappi et al., 2017, p. 11). Drivers’ eye movements are determined in part by control mechanisms (e.g., path planning) (Lappi & Mole, 2018). These mech- anisms are responsive to drivers’ goals. For example, professional racing drivers have the goal of driving as fast as possible whereas many ordinary drivers have the goal of driving safely.

Drivers going around bends use optic-flow information. They also make some use of the tangent point. This is a relatively simple feature of the visual environment and its use by drivers is in the spirit of Gibson’s perspective. What are the limitations of Gibson’s approach and other related approaches? (1) Individuals moving directly towards a target use several kinds of information (e.g., binocular disparity; retinal displacement) ignored by Gibson. (2) The tangent point is used infrequently when individuals move along a curved path: they more often fixate points lying along the future path. (3) Drivers going around bends use a greater variety of information sources than implied by Gibson’s approach. Of most importance, drivers’ eye movements are strongly influenced by active, top-down processes (e.g., motor control) not included within Gibson’s theoris- ing. More specifically, drivers’ eye movements depend on their current driving goals as well as the environmental conditions. (4) Research and theorising have de-emphasised meta-cognition (beliefs about one’s own performance). Mole and Lappi (2018) found drivers often made inaccurate meta-cognitive judgements of their own driving performance (e.g., they tended to exaggerate the importance of driving speed in determining performance). Such inaccurate judgements prob- ably often lead to impaired driving performance. Time to contact In everyday life, we often need to predict the moment of contact between us and some object. These situations include ones where we are moving towards an object (e.g., a wall) and those in which an object (e.g., a ball) is approaching us. We might work out the time to contact by dividing our estimate of the object’s distance by our estimate of its speed. However, this would be complex and error-prone because information about speed and distance is not directly available. Lee (1976, 2009) argued that there is a simpler way to work out the time to contact or collision. If we approach it (or it approaches us) at constant velocity, we can use tau. Tau is defined as the size of an object’s retinal image divided by its rate of expansion. The faster the rate of expansion, the less time there is to contact. When driving, the rate of decline of tau over time (tau-dot) indicates whether there is sufficient braking time to stop before contact or collision. Lee (1976) argued drivers brake to hold constant the rate of change of tau. This tau-dot hypothesis is consistent with Gibson’s approach because it assumes tau-dot is an invariant available to observers from optic flow. Lee’s theoretical approach has been highly influential. However, his emphasis on tau has limited applicability in various ways (Tresilian, 1999). First, tau ignores acceleration in object velocity. Second, tau only provides information about the time to contact or collision with the eyes.

Third, tau is accurate only when applied to spherically symmetrical objects: do not rely on it when catching a rugby ball! Harrison et al. (2016) argued that people’s behaviour is often influ- enced by factors other than their estimate of the time to contact. For example, consider someone deciding whether to cross a road when there is an approaching car. Their decision is often influenced by judgements of their physical mobility and their personality (e.g., cautious or impetuous) (see p. 151). Findings According to Lee’s (1976) theory, observers can often judge time to contact accurately based on using tau relatively “automatically”. If so, observ- ers’ time-to-contact judgements might not be impaired if they performed a cognitively demanding task while observing an object’s movement. Baurès et al. (2018) obtained support for this prediction. Indeed, time-to- contact judgements were more accurate when observers performed a sec- ondary task, perhaps because this made it less likely they would attend to potentially misleading information (e.g., expectations about an object’s movements). According to Lee (1976), judgements of the time to contact when catching a ball should depend crucially on the rate of expansion of the ball’s retinal image. Savelsbergh et al. (1993) used a deflating ball having a significantly slower rate of expansion than an ordinary ball. The pre- diction was that peak grasp closure should occur later to the deflating ball. This prediction was confirmed. However, the actual slowing was much less than predicted (30 ms vs 230 ms). Participants minimised the distorting effects of manipulating the rate of expansion by using additional sources of information (e.g., depth cues). Hosking and Crassini (2010) had par- ticipants judge time to contact for familiar objects (tennis ball and football) presented in their standard size or with their sizes reversed. They also used unfamiliar black spheres. Contrary to Lee’s hypothesis, time-to-contact judgments were influenced by familiar size (especially when the object was a very large tennis ball) leading participants to overesti- mate time to contact (see Figure 4.5). Tau is available in monocular vision. However, observers often make use of infor- mation available in binocular vision, espe- cially binocular disparity (see Chapter 2). Fath et al. (2018) discussed research showing binocular information sometimes provides more accurate judgements than tau of time to contact (e.g., when viewing small objects or rotating non-spherical objects). Figure 4.5 Errors in time-to-contact judgements for the smaller and the larger object as a function of whether they were presented in their standard size, the reverse size (off-size) or lacking texture (no-texture). Positive values indicate that responses were made too late and negative values that they were made too early. From Hosking and Crassini (2010).

(2018) assessed accuracy of time-to- contact judgements when observers viewed fast- or slow-moving objects. They used three conditions varying in the amount of information available to observers: (1) monocular flow information only (permitting assessment of tau); (2) binocular disparity information only; (3) all sources of infor- mation available. Fath et al. predicted that binocular disparity information would be less likely to be used with fast-moving objects than slow-moving ones because it is relatively time-consuming to calculate changes in binoc- ular disparity over time. What did Fath et al. (2018) find? First, with fast objects, time-to- contact judgements were more accurate with monocular flow information only than with binocular disparity information only. Second, with slow objects, the opposite findings were obtained. Third, accuracy of time-to- contact judgements when all sources of information were available were comparable to accuracy in the better of the single-source conditions with fast and with slow objects. DeLucia (2013) found observers mistakenly predicted a large approach- ing object would reach them sooner than a closer small approaching object: the size-arrival effect. This effect occurred because observers attached more importance to relative size than tau. We turn now to research on drivers’ braking decisions. Lee’s (1976) notion that drivers brake to hold constant the rate of change of tau was tested by Yilmaz and Warren (1995). They told participants to stop at a stop sign in a simulated driving task. As predicted, there was generally a linear reduction in tau during braking. However, some participants showed large rather than gradual changes in tau shortly before stopping. Tijtgat et al. (2008) found individual differences in stereo vision influ- enced drivers’ braking behaviour to avoid a collision. Drivers with weak stereo vision started braking earlier than those with normal stereo vision and their peak deceleration also occurred earlier. Those with weak stereo vision found it harder to calculate distances causing them to underestimate the time to contact. Thus, deciding when to brake does not depend only on tau or tau-dot. Harrison et al. (2016) argued that Lee’s (1976) theoretical approach is limited in two important ways when applied to drivers’ braking behaviour. First, it ignores physical limitations in the real world. For example, tau-dot specifies to a driver the deceleration during braking required to avoid col- lision. However, this strategy will not work if the driver’s braking system makes the required deceleration unachievable. Second, individuals differ in the emphasis they place on minimisation of costs (e.g., preferred safety margin). According to Harrison et al., these limitations suggest drivers’ braking behaviour is influenced by their sensi- tivity to relevant affordances (possibilities for action) such as their knowl- edge of the dynamics of the braking system in their car. Evaluation The notion that tau is used to make time-to-contact judgements is simple and elegant. There is much evidence that such judgements are often strongly influenced by tau.

Tau is also often used when drivers make decisions about when to brake. What are the limitations of theory and research in this area? First, time-to-contact judgements are typically more influenced by tau or tau-dot in relatively uncluttered laboratory environments than naturalistic condi- tions (Land, 2009). Second, tau is not the only factor determining time- to-contact judgements. As Land (2009, p. 853) pointed out, “The brain will accept all valid cues in the performance of an action, and weight them according to their current reliability.” These cues can include object famili- arity, binocular disparity and relative size. It clearly makes sense to use all the available information in this way. Third, the tau hypothesis ignores the emotional value of the approach- ing object. Time-to-contact judgements are shorter for threatening pictures than neutral ones (Brendel et al., 2012). This makes evolutionary sense – it could be fatal to overestimate how long a very threatening object (e.g., a lion) will take to reach you! Fourth, braking behaviour involves factors additional to tau and tau-dot. For example, there are individual differences in preferred safety margin. Rock et al. (2006) identified an alternative braking strategy in a real-world driving task in which drivers directly estimated the constant ideal deceleration required to stop at a given point. VISUALLY GUIDED ACTION: CONTEMPORARY APPROACHES The previous section focused mainly on the issue of how we use visual information when moving through the environment. Here we consider similar issues but the emphasis shifts towards processes involved in success- ful goal-directed action towards objects. For example, how do we reach for a cup of coffee? This issue was addressed by Milner and Goodale (1995, 2008) in their perception-action model (see Chapter 2). Contemporary approaches that have developed and extended the perception-action model are discussed below. Role of planning: planning-control model Glover (2004) proposed a planning-control model of goal-directed action towards objects. According to this model, we initially use a planning system followed by a control system but the two systems often overlap in time. Here are the main features of the two systems: (1) Planning system ● It is used mostly before the initiation of movement. ● It selects an appropriate target (e.g., cup of coffee), decides how it should be grasped and works out the timing of the movement. ● It is influenced by factors such as the individual’s goals, the nature of the target object, the visual context and various cogni- tive processes. ● It is relatively slow because it uses much information and is influ- enced by conscious processes.

Efference copy (see Glossary) is used to compare actual with desired movement. Proprioception is also involved. ● It is influenced by the target object’s spatial characteristics (e.g., size; shape; orientation) but not by the surrounding context. ● It is fairly fast because it uses little information and is not suscep- tible to conscious influence. According to the planning-control model, most errors in human action stem from the planning system. In contrast, the control system typically ensures actions are accurate and achieve their goal. Many visual illusions occur because of the influence of visual context. Since information about visual context is used only by the planning system, responses to visual illu- sions should typically be inaccurate if they depend on the planning system but accurate if they depend on the control system. There are similarities between the planning-control model and Milner and Goodale’s perception-action model. However, Glover (2004) focused more on the processing changes occurring during action performance. Findings Glover et al. (2012) compared the brain areas involved in planning and control using a planning condition (prepare to reach and grasp an object but remain still) and a control condition (reach out immediately for the object). There was practically no overlap in the brain areas associated with planning and control. This finding supports the model’s assumption that planning and control processes are separate. According to the planning-control model, various factors (e.g., seman- tic properties of the visual scene) influence the planning process associated with goal-directed movements but not the subsequent control process. This prediction was tested by Namdar et al. (2014). Participants grasped an object in front of them using their thumb and index finger. The object had a task-irrelevant digit (1, 2, 8 or 9) on it. As predicted, numerically larger digits led to larger grip apertures during the first half of the movement tra- jectory but not the second half (involving the control process). According to Glover (2004), action planning involves conscious processing followed by rapid non-conscious processing during action control. These theoretical assumptions can be tested by requiring partic- ipants to carry out a second task while performing an action towards an object. According to the model, this second task should disrupt planning but not control. However, Hesse et al. (2012) found a second task dis- rupted planning and control when participants made grasping movements towards objects. Thus, planning and control can both require attentional resources. According to the model, visual illusions occur because misleading visual context influences the initial planning system rather than the later KEY TERM Proprioception An individual’s awareness of the position and orientation of parts of their body.

Vision was available only during the first 200 ms of movement or the last 200 ms. The findings were opposite to those predicted theoretically – performance was more accurate with early vision than late vision. Elliott et al. (2017) explained the above findings with their multiple process model. According to this model, performance was good when early vision was available because of a control system known as impulse control. Impulse control “entails an early, and continuing, comparison of expected sensory consequences to perceived sensory consequences to regulate limb direction and velocity during the distance-covering phase of the move- ment” (p. 108). Evaluation Glover’s (2004) planning-control model has proved successful in various ways. First, it successfully developed the common assumption that motor movements towards an object involve successive planning and control pro- cesses. Second, the assumption cognitive processes are important in action planning is correct. Third, there is evidence (e.g., Glover et al., 2012) that separate brain areas are involved in planning and control. What are the model’s limitations? First, the planning system involves several very different processes: “goal determination; target identification and selection; analysis of object affordances [potential object uses]; timing; and computation of the metrical properties of the target such as its size, shape, orientation and position relative to the body” (Glover et al., 2012, p. 909). This diversity sheds doubt on the assumption there is a single plan- ning system. Second, the model argues control occurs late during object-directed movements and is influenced by visual feedback. However, there appears to be a second control process (called impulse control by Elliott et al., 2017) operating throughout the movement trajectory and not influenced by visual feedback. Third, and related to the second point, the model presents an over- simplified picture of the processes involved in goal-directed action. More specifically, the processing involved in producing goal-directed movements is far more complex than implied by the notion of a planning process fol- lowed by a control process. For example, planning and control processes are often so intermixed that “the distinction between movement planning and movement control is blurred” (Gallivan et al., 2018, p. 519). Fourth, complex decision-making processes are often involved when individuals plan goal-directed actions in the real world. For example, when planning, tennis players players must often decide between a simple shot minimising energy expenditure and risk or injury or a more ambitious shot that might immediately win the current point (Gallivan et al., 2018). Fifth, the model is designed to account for planning and control pro- cesses when only one object is present or of interest. In contrast, visual scenes in everyday life are often far more complex and contain several objects of potential relevance (see below).

How do we resolve competition among action plans? According to Song (2017, p. 1), “Critical is the existence of parallel motor planning processes, which allow efficient and timely changes.” What evidence indicates we often process information about several different potential actions simultaneously? Suppose participants are given the task of reaching rapidly towards a target in the presence of distrac- tors (Song & Nakayama, 2008). On some trials, their reach is initially directed towards the target. On other trials, their initial reach is directed towards a distractor but this is corrected in mid-flight producing a strongly curved trajectory. Song and Nakayama’s key finding was that corrective movements occurred very rapidly following the onset of the initial move- ment. This finding strongly implies that the corrective movement had been planned prior to execution of the initial incorrect movement. Song (2017) discussed several other studies where similar findings were obtained. He concluded, “The sensori-motor system generates multiple competing plans in parallel before actions are initiated . . . this concur- rent processing enables us to efficiently resolve competition and select one appropriate action rapidly” (p. 6). Brain pathways In their perception-action model, Milner and Goodale (1995, 2008) dis- tinguished between a ventral stream or pathway and a dorsal stream or pathway (see Chapter 2). In approximate terms, the ventral stream is involved in object perception whereas the dorsal stream “is generally con- sidered to mediate the visual guidance of action, primarily in real time” (Milner, 2017, p. 1297). Much recent research has indicated that the above theoretical account is oversimplified (see Chapter 2). Of central importance is the accumulat- ing evidence that there are actually two somewhat separate dorsal streams (Osiurak et al., 2017; Sakreida et al., 2016): (1) The dorso-dorsal stream: processing in this stream relates to the online control of action and is hand-centred; it has been described as the “grasp” system (Binkofski & Buxbaum, 2013). (2) The ventro-dorsal stream: processing in this stream is offline and relies on memorised knowledge of objects and tools and is object-centred; it has been described as the “use” system (Binkofski & Buxbaum, 2013). Sakreida et al. (2016) identified several other differences between these two streams (see Figure 4.6). In essence, object processing within the dorso- dorsal stream is variable because it is determined by the immediately acces- sible properties of an object (e.g., its size and shape). Such processing is fast and “automatic”. In contrast, processing within the ventro-dorsal stream is stable because it is determined by memorised object knowledge.

Findings Considerable neuroimaging evidence supports the proposed distinction between two dorsal streams. Martin et al. (2018, p. 3755) reviewed research indicating the dorso-dorsal stream “traverses from visual area V3a through V6 toward the superior parietal lobule, and . . . reaches the dorsal premotor cortex”. In contrast, the ventro-dorsal stream “encompasses higher- order visual areas like MT/V5+, the inferior parietal lobule . . . as well as the ventral premotor cortex and inferior frontal gyru” (p. 3755). Sakreida et al. (2016) conducted a meta-analytic review based on 71 neuroimaging studies and obtained similar findings. Evidence from brain-damaged patients is also supportive of the dis- tinction between two dorsal streams. First, we consider patients with damage to the ventro-dorsal stream. Much research has focused on limb apraxia, a disorder where patients often fail to make precise goal-directed actions in spite of possessing the physical ability to perform those actions (Pellicano et al., 2017). More specifically, “Reaching and grasping actions in LA [limb apraxia] are normal when vision of the limb and target is available, but typically degrade when they must be performed ‘off-line’, as when subjects are blindfolded prior to movement execution” (Binkovski & Buxbaum, 2013, p. 5). This pattern of findings is expected if the dorso- dorsal stream is intact in patients with limb apraxia. Second, we consider patients with damage to the dorso-dorsal stream. Much research here has focused on optic ataxia (see Glossary). As pre- dicted, patients with optic ataxia have impaired online motor control and so exhibit inaccurate reaching towards (and grasping of) objects. Evaluation Neuroimaging research has provided convincing evidence for the existence of two dorsal processing streams. The distinction between dorso-dorsal and ventro-dorsal streams has also been supported by studies on brain-damaged Figure 4.6 The dorso-dorsal and ventro-dorsal streams showing their brain locations and forms of processing.

More specifically, there is some evidence for a double dissociation (see Glossary) between the impairments exhibited by patients with limb apraxia and optic ataxia. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, the ventral stream (strongly involved in object recognition) is also important in vis- ually guided action (Osiurak et al., 2017). However, precisely how this stream interacts with the dorso-dorsal and ventro-dorsal streams is unclear. Second, there is some overlap in the brain between the dorso-dorsal and ventro-dorsal streams and so it is important not to exaggerate their inde- pendence. Third, there is a lack of consensus concerning the precise func- tions of the two dorsal streams (see Osiurak et al., 2017, and Sakreida et al., 2016). PERCEPTION OF HUMAN MOTION We are very good at interpreting other people’s movements. We can decide very rapidly whether someone is walking, running or limping. Our initial focus is on two key issues. First, how successfully can we interpret human motion with very limited visual information? Second, do the processes involved in per- ception of human motion differ from those involved in perception of motion in general? If the answer to this question is positive, we also need to consider why the perception of human motion is special. As indicated already, our focus is mostly on the perception of human motion. However, there are many similarities between the perception of human and animal motion, and we will sometimes use the term “biolog- ical motion” to refer generally to the percep- tion of animal motion. Finally, we discuss an important theoret- ical approach based on the notion that the same brain system or network is involved in perceiving and understanding human actions and in performing those same actions. Perceiving human motion Suppose you were presented with point-light displays, as was done initially by Johansson (1973). Actors were dressed entirely in black with lights attached to their joints (e.g., wrists; knees; ankles). They were filmed moving around a darkened room so only the lights were visible to observers watching the film (see Figure 4.7 and “Johansson Motion Perception Part 1” on YouTube).What do you think you would perceive in those circumstances?

In subsequent research, Johansson et al. (1980) found observers per- ceived human motion with no apparent difficulty when viewing a point- light display for only one-fifth of a second! Ruffieux et al. (2016) studied a patient, BC, who was cortically blind but had a residual ability to process motion. When presented with two point-light displays (one of a human and one of an animal) at the same time, he generally correctly identified the human. The above findings imply we are very efficient at processing impov- erished point-light displays. However, Lu et al. (2017) reported some contrary evidence. Observers were given two tasks: (1) detecting the presence of a human walker; (2) discriminating whether a human walker was walking leftward or rightward. The walker was presented in point lights, contour, silhouette or as a skeleton. Detection performance was relatively good for the point-light display but discrimination performance was not (see Figure 4.8). Performance was high with the skeleton display because it provided detailed information about the connections between joints. Top-down or bottom-up processes? Johansson (1975) argued the ability to perceive biological motion is innate, describing the processes involved as “spontaneous” and “automatic”. Support was reported by Simion et al. (2008) in a study on newborns (1–3 days). These newborns preferred to look at a display showing biological motion more than one that did not. Remarkably, Simion et al. used point- light displays of chickens of which the newborns had no previous experi- ence. These findings suggest the perception of biological motion involves basic bottom-up processes. Evidence that learning plays a role was reported by Pinto (2006). Three-month-olds were equally sensitive to motion in point-light humans, cats and spiders. In contrast, 5-month-olds were more sensitive to displays of human motion. Thus, the infant visual system becomes increasingly spe- cialised for perceiving human motion.

However, in a review Thompson and Parasuraman (2012) concluded attention is required, especially when the available visual information is ambiguous or competing information is present. Mayer et al. (2015) presented circular arrays of between two and eight video clips. In one condition, observers decided rapidly whether any clip showed human motion; in another condition, they decided whether any clips showed machine motion. There were two key find- ings. First, detection times increased with array size for both human and machine motion, suggesting attention is required to detect both types of motion. Second, the effects of array size on detection times were much greater for machine motion. Thus, searching is more efficient for human than machine motion suggesting human motion perception may be special (see below). Is human motion perception special? Much evidence indicates we are better at detecting human motion than motion in other species (Shiffrar & Thomas, 2013). Cohen (2002) assessed observers’ sensitivity to human, dog and seal motion using point-light displays. Performance was best with human motion and worst with seal motion. Of importance, the same pattern of performance was found in seal trainers and dog trainers. Thus, the key factor is not simply visual experi- ence; instead, we are more sensitive to observed motions resembling our own repertoire of actions. We can also consider whether human motion perception is special by considering the brain. There has been an increasing recognition that many brain areas are involved in biological motion pro- cessing (see Figure 4.9). The pathway from the fusi- form gyrus (FFG) to the superior temporal sulcus (STS) is of particular importance, as are top-down processes from the insula (INS), the STS and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Much research indicates the central importance of the superior temporal sulcus. Grossman et al. (2005) applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stim- ulation (rTMS; see Glossary) to that area to disrupt processing. This caused a substantial reduction in observers’ sensitivity to biological motion. Gilaie- Dotan et al. (2013) found grey matter volume in the superior temporal sulcus correlated positively with the detection of biological (but not non-biological) motion. Evidence from brain-damaged patients indi- cates that perceiving biological motion involves dif- ferent processes from those involved in perceiving object motion generally. Vaina et al. (1990) studied a patient, AF, with damage to the posterior visual pathways. He performed poorly on basic motion Figure 4.9 Brain areas involved in biological motion processing (STS = superior temporal sulcus; IFG = inferior frontal gyrus; INS = insula; Crus 1 = left lateral cerebellar lobule; MTC = middle temporal cortex; OCC = early visual cortex; FFG = fusiform gyrus).

In contrast, Saygin (2007) found in stroke patients with damage in the temporal and premotor frontal areas that their perception of biological motion was more impaired than non-biological motion. Why is biological motion perception special? We could explain the special nature of biological motion perception in three ways (Shiffrar & Thomas, 2013). First, biological motion is the only type of motion humans can produce as well as perceive. Second, most people spend more time perceiving and trying to understand other people’s motion than any other form of visual motion. Third, other people’s movements provide a rich source of social and emotional information. We start with the first reason (discussed further on pp. 161–162). The relevance of motor skills to the perception of biological motion was shown by Kloeters et al. (2017). Patients with Parkinson’s disease (which impairs movement execution) had significantly inferior perception of human movement with point-light displays compared to healthy controls. More dramatically, paraplegics with severe spinal injury were almost three times less sensitive than healthy controls to human movement in point-light displays. We must not exaggerate the importance of motor involvement in bio- logical motion perception. A man, DC, born without upper limbs, identi- fied manual actions shown in videos and photographs as well as healthy controls (Vannuscorps et al., 2013). Motor skills may be most important in biological motion perception when the visual information presented is sparse or ambiguous (e.g., as with point-light displays). Jacobs et al. (2004) obtained support for the second reason listed above. Observers’ ability to identify walkers from point-light displays was much better when the walker was observed for 20 hours a week rather than 5 hours. In our everyday lives, we often recognise individuals in motion by integrating information from biological motion with information from the face and the voice within the superior temporal sulcus (Yovel & O’Toole, 2016). Successful integration of these different information sources clearly depends on learning and experience. We turn now to the third reason mentioned earlier. Charlie Chaplin showed convincingly that bodily movements can convey social and emo- tional information. Atkinson et al. (2004) found observers performed well at identifying emotions from point-light displays (especially for fear, sadness and happiness). Part of the explanation for these findings is that angry individuals walk especially fast whereas fearful or sad ones walk very slowly (Barliya et al., 2013). We can explore the role of social factors in biological motion detec- tion by studying adults with autism spectrum disorder who have severely impaired social interaction skills. The findings are somewhat inconsist- ent However, adults with autism spectrum disorder generally have a rea- sonably intact ability to detect human motion in point-light displays but exhibit impaired emotion processing in such displays (see Bakroon & Lakshminarayanan, 2018 for a review).

(1996) assessed monkeys’ brain activity while they performed a given action and while they observed another monkey perform the same action. They found 17% of neurons in area F5 of the premotor cortex were activated in both conditions. Such findings led theorists to propose a mirror neuron system consisting of neurons activated during both observation and performance of actions (see Keysers et al., 2018, for a review). There have been numerous attempts to identify a mirror neuron system in humans. Our current under- standing of brain areas associated with the mirror neuron system is shown in Figure 4.10. Note that the mirror neuron system consists of an integrated network rather than separate brain areas (Keysers et al., 2018). Most research is limited because it shows only that the same brain areas are involved in action perception and production. Perry et al. (2018) used more precise methods to reveal a more complex picture within areas assumed to form part of the mirror neuron system. Some small areas were activated during both observing actions and imitating them, thus providing evidence for a human neuron system. However, other adjacent areas were acti- vated only during observing or action imitation. More convincing evidence for a human mirror neuron system was reported by de la Rosa et al. (2016). They focused on activation in parts of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA44/45) corresponding to area F5 in monkeys. Their key finding was that 52 voxels (see Glossary) within BA44/45 responded to both action perception and action production. Before proceeding, we should note the term “mirror neuron system” is somewhat misleading because mirror neurons do not provide us with an exact motoric coding of observed actions. As Williams (2013, p. 2962) wittily remarked, “If only this was the case! I could become a Olympic ice- skater or a concert pianist!” Findings We have seen that neuroimaging studies have indicated that the mirror neuron system is activated during motor perception and action. Such evi- dence is correlational, and so does not demonstrate that the mirror neuron system is necessary for motor perception and action understanding. More direct evidence comes from research on brain-damaged patients. Binder et al. (2017) studied left-hemisphere stroke patients with apraxia (impaired ability to perform planned actions) having damage within the mirror neuron system (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus). These patients had comparable deficits in action imitation, action recognition and action PMv Mirror network Visual input Motor output pMT G/STS PF PMd AIP SIM1 Figure 4.10 The main brain areas associated with the mirror neuron system (MNS) plus their interconnections (red).

Another predicted finding was that left-hemisphere stroke patients without apraxia had less brain damage in core regions of the mirror neuron system than those with apraxia. Another approach to demonstrating the causal role of the mirror neuron system is to use experimental techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; see Glossary). Avenanti et al. (2018) assessed observers’ ability to predict which object would be grasped after seeing the start of a reaching movement. Task performance was enhanced when anodal tDCS was used to facilitate neural activity within the mirror neuron system, whereas it was impaired when cathodal tDCS was used to inhibit such neural activity. Findings: functions of the mirror neuron system What are the functions of the mirror neuron system? It has often been assumed mirror neurons play a role in working out why someone else is performing certain actions as well as deciding what those actions are. For example, Eagle et al. (2007, p. 131) claimed the mirror neuron system is involved in “the automatic, unconscious, and non-inferential simulation in the observer of the actions, emotions, and sensations carried out and expressed by the observed”. Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia (2016) argued that full understanding of another person’s actions requires a multi-level process. The first level involves identifying the outcome of the observed action and the emotion being displayed by the other person. This is followed by the observer rep- resenting the other person’s desires, beliefs and intentions. The mirror neuron system is primarily involved at the first level but may provide an input to subsequent processes. Lingnau and Petris (2013) argued that understanding another person’s actions often requires complex cognitive processes as well as simpler pro- cesses within the mirror neuron system. Observers saw point-light displays of human actions and some were asked to identify the goal of each action. Areas within the prefrontal cortex (associated with high-level cognitive pro- cesses) were more activated when goal identification was required. These findings can be explained within the context of Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia’s (2016) approach discussed above. Wurm et al. (2016) distinguished between two forms of motion per- ception and understanding. They used the example of observers under- standing that someone is opening a box. If they have a general or abstract understanding of this action, their understanding should generalise to other boxes and other ways of opening a box. In contrast, if they only have a specific or concrete understanding of the action, their understand- ing will not generalise. Wurm et al. (2016) found specific or concrete action understanding could occur within the mirror neuron system. However, more general or abstract understanding involved high-level perceptual regions (e.g., the lateral parieto-temporal cortex) outside the mirror neuron system. In sum, the mirror neuron system is of central importance with respect to some (but not all) aspects of action understanding. More specifically, KEY TERM Apraxia A condition caused by brain damage in which there is greatly reduced ability to perform purposeful or planned bodily movements in spite of the absence of muscular damage.

It is also likely that imitating someone else’s actions often involves processes (e.g., person-perception processes) additional to those directly involving the mirror neuron system (Ramsey, 2018). Overall evaluation Several important research findings have been obtained. First, we have an impressive ability to perceive human or biological motion even with very limited visual input. Second, the brain areas involved in human motion perception differ somewhat from those involved in perceiving motion in general. Third, perception of human motion is special because it is the only type of motion we can both perceive and produce. Fourth, a mirror neuron system allows us to imitate and understand other people’s movements. Fifth, the core brain network of the mirror neuron system has been identi- fied. Its causal role has been established through studies on brain-damaged patients and research using techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, much remains unclear about interactions of bottom-up and top-down processes in the perception of biological motion. Second, the mirror neuron system does not account for all aspects of action understanding. As Gallese and Sinigaglia (2014, p. 200) pointed out, action understanding “involves representing to which . . . goals the action is directed; identifying which beliefs, desires, and intentions specify reasons explaining why the action happened; and realising how those reasons are linked to the agent and to her action”. Third, nearly all studies on the mirror neuron system have investigated its properties with respect only to hand actions. However, somewhat differ- ent mirror neuron networks are probably associated with hand-and-mouth actions (Ferrari et al., 2017a). Fourth, it follows from theoretical approaches to the mirror neuron system that an observer’s ability to understand another person’s actions should be greater if they both execute any given action in a similar fashion. This prediction has been confirmed (Macerollo et al., 2015). Such research indicates the importance of studying individual differences in motor actions, which have so far been relatively neglected. CHANGE BLINDNESS We have seen that a changing visual environment allows us to move in the appropriate direction and to make coherent sense of our surroundings. However, as we will see, our perceptual system does not always respond appropriately to changes in the visual environment. Have a look around you (go on!). You probably have a strong impres- sion of seeing a vivid and detailed picture of the visual scene. As a result, you are probably confident you could immediately detect any reasonably large change in the visual environment. In fact, that is often not the case.

We also consider inattentional blindness, “the failure to consciously per- ceive otherwise salient events when they are not attended” (Ward & Scholl, 2015, p. 722). Research on change blindness focuses on dynamic processes over time. It has produced striking and counterintuitive findings leading to new theoretical thinking about the processes underlying conscious visual awareness. Change blindness and inattentional blindness both depend on a mixture of perceptual and attentional processes. It is thus appropriate to discuss these phenomena at the end of our coverage of perception and immediately prior to the start of our coverage of attention. You have undoubtedly experienced change blindness at the movies caused by unintended continuity mistakes when a scene has been reshot. For example, in the film Skyfall, James Bond is followed by a white car. Mysteriously, this car suddenly becomes black and then returns to being white! For more examples, type “Movie continuity mistakes” into YouTube. We greatly exaggerate our ability to detect visual changes. Levin et al. (2002) asked observers to watch videos involving two people in a restaurant. In one video, the plates change from red to white and in another a scarf worn by one person disappeared. Levin et al. found 46% of observers claimed they would have noticed the change in the colour of the plates without being forewarned and the figure was 78% for the disappearing scarf. In a previous study, 0% of observers detected either change! Levin et al. introduced the term change blindness blindness to describe our wildly optimistic beliefs about our ability to detect visual changes. In the real world, we are often aware of visual changes because we detect motion signals accompanying the change. Laboratory researchers have used various ways to prevent observers from detecting motion signals. One way is to make the change during a saccade (rapid movement of the eyes). Another way is to have a short gap between the original and changed displays (the flicker paradigm). Suppose you walked across a large square close to a unicycling clown wearing a vivid purple and yellow outfit, large shoes and a bright red nose (see Figure 4.11). Would you spot him? I imagine your answer is “Yes”. However, Hyman et al. (2009) found only 51% of people walking on their own spotted the clown. Those failing to spot the clown exhibited inattentional blindness. Change blindness vs inattentional blindness Change blindness and inattentional blindness both involve a failure to detect some visual event KEY TERMS Change blindness Failure to detect various changes (e.g. in objects) in the visual environment. Inattentional blindness Failure to detect an unexpected object appearing in the visual environment. Change blindness blindness The tendency of observers to overestimate greatly the extent to which they can detect visual changes and so avoid change blindness.

Unsurprisingly, failures of attention often play an important role in causing both forms of blindness. However, there are major differences between the two phenomena (Jensen et al., 2011). First, consider the effects of instructing observers to look for unexpected objects or visual changes. Target detection in change blindness paradigms is often hard even with such instructions. In contrast, target detection in inattentional blindness paradigms becomes trivially easy. Second, change blindness involves the use of memory to compare pre- change and post-change stimuli, whereas inattentional blindness does not. Third, inattentional blindness mostly occurs when the observer’s attention is engaged in a demanding task (e.g., chatting on a mobile phone) unlike change blindness. In sum, more complex processing is typically required for successful performance in change blindness tasks. More specifically, observers must engage successfully in five separate processes for change detection to occur (Jensen et al., 2011): (1) Attention must be paid to the change location. (2) The pre-change visual stimulus at the change location must be encoded into memory. (3) The post-change visual stimulus at the change location must be encoded into memory. (4) The pre- and post-change representations must be compared. (5) The discrepancy between the pre- and post-change representations must be recognised at the conscious level. IN THE REAL WORLD: IT’S MAGIC! Magicians benefit from the phenomena of inattentional blindness and change blindness (Kuhn & Martinez, 2012). Most magic tricks involve misdirection which is designed “to disguise the method and thus prevent the audience from detecting it” (Kuhn & Martinez, 2012, p. 2). Many people believe misdirection involves the magician manipulating the audience’s attention away from some action crucial to the trick’s success. That is often (but not always) the case. Inattentional blindness Kuhn and Findlay (2010) studied inattentional blindness using a disappearing lighter (see Figure 4.12 for details). There were three main findings. First, of the observers who detected the drop, 31% were fixating close to the magician’s left hand when the lighter was dropped from that hand. However, 69% were fixating some distance away and so detected the drop in peripheral vision (see Figure 4.13). Second, the average distance between fixation and the drop was the same in those who detected the drop in peripheral vision and those who did not. Third, the time taken after the drop to fixate the left hand was much less in observers using peripheral vision to detect the drop than those failing to detect it (650 ms vs 1,712 ms). What do the above findings mean? The lighter drop can be detected by overt attention (atten- tion directed to the fixation point) or covert attention (attention directed away from the fixation point). Covert attention was surprisingly effective because the human visual system can readily detect movement in peripheral vision (see Chapter 2).

Across several magic tricks (including the lighter trick and other tricks involving change blindness), Ortega et al. (2018) found under 30% of individuals thought they were likely to detect how a trick worked using peripheral vision. In fact, however, over 60% of the tricks where they detected the method involved peripheral vision! Thus, most people exaggerate the role of central vision in understanding magic tricks. Change blindness Smith et al. (2012) used a magic trick in which a coin was passed from one hand to the other and then dropped. Observers guessed whether the coin landed heads or tails. On one trial, the coin was switched (e.g., from a £1 coin to a 2p coin). All observers fixated the coin throughout the time it was visible but about 90% failed to detect the coin had changed! Thus, an object can be attended to without some of the features irrelevant to the current task being processed sufficiently to prevent change blindness. Figure 4.12 The sequence of events in the disappearing lighter trick: (a) the magician picks up a lighter with his left hand and (b) lights it; (c) and (d) he pretends to take the flame with his right hand and (e) gradually moves it away from the hand holding the lighter; (f) he reveals his right hand is empty while the lighter is dropped into his lap; (g) the magician directs his gaze to his left hand and (h) reveals that his left hand is also empty and the lighter has disappeared.

Explicit instructions to observers to keep their eyes on the cards influenced overt attention but failed to reduce change blindness. Conclusions The success of many magic tricks depends less on where observers are fixating (overt attention) than we might think. Observers can be deceived even when their overt attention is directed to the crucial location. In addition, they often avoid change blindness or inattentional blindness even when their overt attention is directed some distance away from the crucial location. Such findings are typically explained by assuming the focus of covert attention often differs from that of overt attention. More generally, peripheral vision is often of more importance to the detection of magic tricks than most people believe. Change blindness underestimates visual processing Ball and Busch (2015) distinguished between two types of change detec- tion: (1) seeing the object that changed; (2) sensing there has been a change without conscious awareness of which object has changed. Several coloured objects were presented in pre- and post-change displays. If the post-change display contained a colour not present in the pre-change display, observ- ers often sensed change had occurred without being aware of what had changed. When observers show change blindness, it does not necessarily mean there was no processing of the change. Ball et al. (2015) used object changes where the two objects were semantically related (e.g., rail car changed to rail) or unrelated (e.g., rail car changed to sausage). Use of event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) revealed a larger negative wave when the objects were semantically unrelated even when observers exhibited change blindness. Thus, there was much unconscious processing of the pre- and post-change objects. What causes change blindness? There is no single (or simple) answer to the question “What causes change blindness?”. However, two major competing theories both provide partial answers. First, there is the attentional approach (e.g., Rensink et al., 1997). According to this approach, change detection requires selective attention to be focused on the object that changes. Attention is typically directed to only a limited part of visual space, and changes in unattended objects are unlikely to be detected. Second, there is a theoretical approach emphasising the importance of peripheral vision (Rosenholtz, 2017a,b; Sharan et al., 2016 unpublished). It is based on the assumption that visual processing occurs in parallel across the entire visual field (including peripheral vision). According to this approach, “Peripheral vision is a limiting factor underlying standard demonstrations of change blindness” (Sharan et al., 2016, p. 1).

We typically attend to regions of a visual scene likely to contain salient or important information. Spot the differences between the pictures in Figure 4.14. Observers took an average of 10.4 seconds with the first pair of pictures but only 2.6 with the second pair (Rensink et al., 1997). The height of the railing is less important than the helicopter’s position. Hollingworth and Henderson (2002) recorded eye movements while observers viewed visual scenes (e.g., kitchen; living room). It was assumed the object fixated at any moment was the being attended. There were two potential changes in each scene: ● Type change: an object was replaced by one from a different category (e.g., a plate replaced by a bowl). ● Token change: an object was replaced by an object from the same cat- egory (e.g., a plate replaced by a different plate). Figure 4.14 (a) The object that is changed (the railing) undergoes a shift in location comparable to that of the object that is changed (the helicopter) in (b). However, the change is much easier to see in (b) because the changed object is more important. From Rensink et al. (1997). Reprinted by permission of SAGE Publications.

First, there was much greater change detection when the changed object was fixated prior to the change than when it was not fixated (see Figure 4.15a). Second, there was change blindness for 60% of objects fixated prior to changing. Thus, attention to the to-be-changed object was necessary (but not sufficient) for change detection. Third, change detection was much greater when the object type changed rather than simply token change because type changes are more dramatic and obvious. Evaluation The attentional approach has various successes to its credit. First, change detection is greater when target stimuli are salient or important and so attract attention. Second, change detection is generally greater when the to-be-changed object has been fixated (attended to) prior to the change. What are the limitations with the attentional approach? First, the notion that narrow-focused attention determines our visual experience is Figure 4.15 (a) Percentage of correct change detection as a function of form of change (type vs token) and time of fixation (before vs after change); also false alarm rate when there was no change. (b) Mean percentage correct change detection as a function of the number of fixations between target fixation and change of target and form of change (type vs token).

Second, “A selective attention account is hard to prove or disprove, as it relies on largely unknown attentional loci as well as poorly understood effects of attention” (Sharan et al., 2016). Third, change blindness is sometimes poorly predicted by the focus of overt attention (indexed by eye fixations) (e.g., Smith et al., 2012; Kuhn et al., 2016). Such findings are often explained by covert attention, but this is typically not measured directly. Fourth, the attentional approach implies incorrectly that very little useful information is extracted from visual areas outside the focus of attention (see below). Peripheral vision approach Visual acuity is greatest in the centre of the visual field (the fovea; see Glossary). However, peripheral vision (all vision outside the fovea) typically covers the great majority of the visual field (see Chapter 2). As Rosenholtz (2016, p. 438) pointed out, it is often assumed “Peripheral vision is impov- erished and all but useless”. This is a great exaggeration even though acuity and colour perception are much worse in the periphery than the fovea. In fact, peripheral vision is often most impaired by visual crowding: “iden- tification of a peripheral object is impaired by nearby objects” (Pirkner & Kimchi, 2017, p. 1) (see Chapter 5). According to Sharan et al. (2016, p. 3), “The hypothesis that change blindness may arise in part from limitations of peripheral vision is quite different from usual explanations of the phenomenon [which attribute it to] a mix of inattention and lack of details stored in memory.” Sharan et al. (2016) tested the above hypothesis. Initially, they catego- rised change-detection tasks as easy, medium and hard on the basis of how rapidly observers detected the change. Then they presented these tasks to different observers who fixated at various degrees of visual angle (eccentric- ities) from the area that changed. There were two key findings: (1) Change-detection performance was surprisingly good even when the change occurred well into peripheral vision. (2) Peripheral vision plays a major role in determining change-detection performance – hard-to-detect changes require closer fixations than those that are easy to detect.

On each trial, two real-world scenes were presented with an interval of 1,500 ms between them. When this interval was unfilled, only 11% of changes were detected. However, when a cue indicating the location of a possible change was pre- sented 0, 300 or 1,000 ms after the offset of the first scene, change-detection rates were much higher. They were greatest in the 0 ms condition (29%) and lowest in the 1,000 ms condition (18%). Thus, much information about the first scene (including information from peripheral vision) was stored briefly in iconic memory (see Glossary and Chapter 6). If peripheral vision provides observers with general or gist information, they might detect global scene changes without detecting precisely what had changed. Howe and Webb (2014) obtained support for this prediction. Observers were presented with an array of 30 discs (15 red, 15 green). On 24% of trials when three discs changed colour, observers detected the array had changed but could not identify the discs involved. Evaluation The peripheral vision approach has proved successful in various ways. First, visual information is often extracted from across the entire visual field as predicted by this approach (but not the attentional approach). This supports our strong belief that we perceive most of the immediate visual environment. Second, this approach capitalises on established knowledge concerning peripheral vision. Third, this approach has been applied suc- cessfully to explain visual-search performance (see Chapter 5). What are the limitations of this approach? First, it de-emphasises atten- tion’s role in determining change blindness, and does not provide a detailed account of how attentional and perceptual processes are integrated. Second, Sharan et al. (2016) discovered change detection was sometimes difficult even though the change could be perceived easily in peripheral vision. This indicates that other factors (as yet unidentified) are also involved. Third, the approach does not consider failure to compare pre- and post-change representations as a reason for change blindness (see below). Comparison of pre- and post-change representations Change blindness can occur because observers fail to compare their pre- and post-change representations. Angelone et al. (2003) presented a video in which the identity of the central actor changed. On a subsequent line-up task to identify the pre-change actor, observers showing change blindness performed comparably to those showing change detection (53% vs 46%, respectively). Varakin et al. (2007) extended the above research in a real-world study in which a coloured binder was switched for one of a different colour while observers’ eyes were closed. Some observers exhibited change blindness even though they remembered the colours of the pre- and post-change binders and so had failed to compare the two colours. Other observers showing change blindness had poor memory for the pre- and post-change colours and so failed to represent these two pieces of information in memory.

Fischer and Whitney (2014) argued the answer is “No”. The visual world is typically relatively stable over short time periods. As a result, it is worthwhile for us to sacrifice perceptual accuracy occasionally to ensure we have a continuous, stable perception of our visual environment. Fischer and Whitney (2014) supported their argument by finding the perceived orientation of a grating was biased in the direction of a previ- ously presented grating, an effect known as serial dependence. Manassi et al. (2018) found serial dependence for an object’s location – when an object that had been presented previously was re-presented, it was per- ceived as being closer to its original location than was actually the case. Serial dependence probably involves several stages of visual perception and may also involve memory processes (Bliss et al., 2017). In sum, the visual system’s emphasis on perceptual stability inhibits our ability to detect changes within the visual scene. Inattentional blindness and its causes The most famous study on inattentional blindness was reported by Simons and Chabris (1999). In one condition, observers watched a video where stu- dents dressed in white (the white team) passed a ball to each other and the observers counted the number of passes (see the video at www.simonslab. com/videos.html). At some point, a woman in a black gorilla suit walks into camera shot, looks at the camera, thumps her chest and then walks off (see Figure 4.17). Altogether she is on screen for 9 seconds. Very surprisingly, only 42% of observers noticed the gorilla! This is a striking example of inattentional blindness. Why was performance so poor in the above experiment? Simons and Chabris (1999) obtained additional relevant evi- dence. In a second condition, observers counted the number of passes made by stu- dents dressed in black. Here 83% of observ- ers detected the gorilla’s presence. Thus, observers were more likely to attend to the gorilla when it resembled task-relevant stimuli (i.e., in colour). It is generally assumed detection perfor- mance is good when observers count black team passes because of selective attention to black objects. Indeed, Rosenholtz et al. (2016) found that observers counting black team passes had eye fixations closer to the gorilla than those counting white team passes. However, Rosenholtz et al. also found that observers counting black team passes (but whose fixation patterns resem- bled those of observers counting white KEY TERM Serial dependence Systematic bias of current visual perception towards recent visual input.

Thus, detection performance may depend on the strengths and limitations of peripheral vision as well as failures of selective attention. The presence of inattentional blindness can lead us to underestimate the amount of processing of the undetected stimulus. Schnuerch et al. (2016) found categorising attended stimuli was slower when the meaning of an undetected stimulus conflicted with that of the attended stimulus. Thus, the meaning of undetected stimuli was processed despite inatten- tional blindness. Other research using event-related potentials (reviewed by Pitts, 2018) has shown that undetected stimuli typically receive moderate processing. How can we explain inattentional blindness? As we have seen, expla- nations often emphasise the role of selective attention or attentional set. Simons and Chabris’ (1999) findings indicate the importance of similarity in stimulus features (e.g., colour) between task stimuli and the unexpected object. However, Most (2013) argued that similarity in semantic category is also important. Participants tracked numbers or letters. On the critical trial, an unexpected stimulus (the letter E or number 3) was visible for 7 seconds. The letter and number were visually identical except they were mirror images of each other. What did Most (2013) find? There was much less inattentional blind- ness when the unexpected stimulus belonged to the same category as the tracked objects. Thus, inattentional blindness can depend on attentional sets based on semantic categories (e.g., letters; numbers). Légal et al. (2017) investigated the role of demanding top-down atten- tional processes in producing inattentional blindness using Simons and Chabris’ (1999) gorilla video. Some observers counted the passes made by the white team (standard task) whereas others had the more attentionally demanding task of counting the number of aerial passes as well as total passes. As predicted, there was much more evidence of inattentional blind- ness (i.e., failing to detect the gorilla) when the task was more demanding. Légal et al. (2017) reduced inattentional blindness in other conditions by presenting detection-relevant words subliminally (e.g., identify; notice) to observers prior to watching the video. This increased detection rates for the gorilla in the standard task condition from 50% to 83%. Overall, the findings indicate that manipulating attentional processes can have powerful effects on inattentional blindness. Compelling evidence that inattentional blindness depends on top-down processes that strongly influence what we expect to see was reported by Persuh and Melara (2016). Observers fixated a central dot followed by the presentation of two coloured squares and decided whether the colours were the same. On the critical trial, the dot was replaced by Barack Obama’s face (see Figure 4.18). Amazingly, 60% of observers failed to detect this unexpected stimulus presented in foveal vision: Barack Obama blindness. Of these observers, a below-chance 8% identified Barack Obama when deciding whether the unexpected stimulus was Angelina Jolie, a lion’s head, an alarm clock or Barack Obama (see Figure 4.18). Persuh and Melara’s (2016) findings are dramatic because they indi- cate inattentional blindness can occur even when the novel stimulus is pre- sented on its own with no competing stimuli.

Evaluation Several factors influencing inattentional blindness have been identified. These factors include the similarity (in terms of stimulus features and semantic category) between task stimuli and the unexpected object; the attentional demands of the task; and observers’ expectations concerning what they will see. If there were no task requiring attentional resources and creating expectations, there would undoubtedly be very little inattentional blindness (Jensen et al., 2011). What are the limitations of research in this area? First, it is typically unclear whether inattentional blindness is due to perceptual failure or to memory failure (i.e., the unexpected object is perceived but rapidly for- gotten). However, Ward and Scholl (2015) found that observers showed inattentional blindness even when observers were instructed to report immediately seeing anything unexpected. This finding strongly sug- gests that inattentional blindness reflects deficient perception rather than memory failure. Second, observers typically engage in some processing of undetected stimuli even when they fail to report the presence of such stimuli (Pitts, 2018). More research is required to clarify the extent of non-conscious pro- cessing of undetected stimuli. Third, it is likely that the various factors influencing inattentional blindness interact in complex ways. However, most research has consid- ered only a single factor and so the nature of such interactions has not been established.

The changes in visual perception produced as we move around the environment and/or environmental objects move promote accurate perception and facilitate appropriate actions. • Direct perception. Gibson argued perception and action are closely intertwined and so research should not focus exclusively on static observers perceiving static visual displays. According to his direct theory, an observer’s movement creates optic flow providing useful information about the direction of heading. Invariants, which are unchanged as people move around their environment, have particular importance. Gibson claimed the uses of objects (their affordances) are perceived directly. He underestimated the complexity of visual processing, minimising the role of object knowledge in visual perception, with the effects of motion on perception being more complex than he realised. • Visually guided movement. The perception of heading depends in part on optic-flow information. However, there are complexities because the retinal flow field is determined by eye and head movements as well as by optic flow. Heading judgements are also influenced by binocular disparity and the retinal displacement of objects as we approach them. Accurate steering on curved paths (e.g., driving around a bend) sometimes involves focusing on the tangent point (e.g., point on the inside edge of the road at which its direction seems to reverse). However, drivers sometimes fixate a point along the future path. More generally, drivers’ gaze patterns are flexibly determined by control mechanisms that are responsive to their goals. Calculating time to contact with an object often involves calculating tau (the size of the retinal image divided by the object’s rate of expansion). Drivers often use tau-dot (rate of decline of tau over time) to decide whether there is sufficient braking time to stop before contact. Observers often make use of additional sources of information (e.g., binocular disparity; familiar size; relative size) when working out time to contact. Drivers’ braking decisions also depend on their preferred margin of safety and the effectiveness of the car’s braking system. • Visually guided action: contemporary approaches. The planning- control model distinguishes between a slow planning system used mostly before the initiation of movement and a fast control system used during movement execution. As predicted, separate brain areas are involved in planning and control. However, the definition of “planning” is very broad, and the notion that planning always precedes control is oversimplified.

This theoretical approach is supported by studies on brain-damaged patients and by neuroimaging research. • Perception of human motion. Human motion is perceived even when only impoverished visual information is available. Perception of human and biological motion involves bottom-up and top-down processes with the latter most likely to be used with degraded visual input. The perception of human motion is special because we can produce as well as perceive human actions and because we devote considerable time to making sense of it. It has often been assumed that our ability to imitate and understand human motion depends on a mirror neuron system (an extensive brain network). This system’s causal involvement in action perception and understanding has been shown in research on brain-damaged patients and studies using techniques to alter its neural activity. The mirror neuron system is especially important in the understanding of relatively simple actions. However, additional high-level cognitive processes are often required if action understanding is complex or involves generalising from past experience. • Change blindness. There is convincing evidence for change blindness and inattentional blindness. Change blindness depends on attentional processes: it occurs more often when the changed object does not receive attention. However, change blindness can occur for objects that are fixated and it also depends on the limitations of peripheral vision. The visual system’s emphasis on continuous, stable perception probably plays a part in making us susceptible to change blindness. Inattentional blindness depends very strongly on top-down processes (e.g., selective attention) and can be found even when only the novel stimulus is present in the visual field.

We use attention to avoid being hit by cars when crossing the road, to search for missing objects and to perform two tasks together. The word “attention” has various meanings but typically refers to selectivity of processing as emphasised by William James (1890, pp. 403–404): Attention is . . . the taking into possession of the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalisation, concentration, of conscious- ness are of its essence. William James distinguished between “active” and “passive” modes of attention. Attention is active when controlled in a top-down way by the individual’s goals or expectations. In contrast, attention is passive when controlled in a bottom-up way by external stimuli (e.g., a loud noise). This distinction remains theoretically important (e.g., Corbetta & Shulman, 2002; see discussion, pp. 192–196). Another important distinction is between focused and divided atten- tion. Focused attention (or selective attention) is studied by present- ing individuals with two or more stimulus inputs at the same time and instructing them to respond to only one. Research on focused or selective attention tells us how effectively we can select certain inputs and avoid being distracted by non-task inputs. It also allows us to study the selection process and the fate of unattended stimuli. Divided attention is also studied by presenting at least two stimulus inputs at the same time. However, individuals are instructed they must attend (and respond) to all stimulus inputs. Divided attention is also known as multi-tasking (see Glossary). Studies of divided attention provide useful information about our processing limitations and the capacity of our attentional mechanisms.

External attention is “the selec- tion and modulation of sensory information” (Chun et al., 2011). In con- trast, internal attention is “the selection, modulation, and maintenance of internally generated information, such as task rules, responses, long-term memory, or working memory” (Chun et al., 2011, p. 73). The connec- tion to Baddeley’s working memory model is especially important (e.g., Baddeley (2012); see Chapter 6). The central executive component of working memory is involved in attentional control and is crucially involved in internal and external attention. Much attentional research has two limitations. First, the emphasis is on attention to externally presented task stimuli rather than internally gen- erated stimuli (e.g., worries; self-reflection). One reason is that it is easier to assess and to control external attention. Second, what participants attend to is determined by the experimenter’s instructions. In contrast, what we attend to in the real world is mostly determined by our current goals and emotional states. Two important topics related to attention are discussed elsewhere. Change blindness (see Glossary), which shows the close links between atten- tion and perception, is considered in Chapter 4. Consciousness (including its relationship to attention) is discussed in Chapter 16. FOCUSED AUDITORY ATTENTION Many years ago, British scientist Colin Cherry (1953) became fascinated by the cocktail party problem – how can we follow just one conversation when several people are talking at once? As we will see, there is no simple answer. McDermott (2009) identified two problems listeners face when attend- ing to one voice among many. First, there is sound segregation: the listener must decide which sounds belong together. This is complex: machine-based speech recognition programs often perform poorly when attempting to achieve sound segregation with several sound sources present together (Shen et al., 2008). Second, after segregation has been achieved, the listener must direct attention to the sound source of interest and ignore the others. McDermott (2009) pointed out that auditory segmentation is often harder than visual segmentation (deciding which visual features belong to which objects; see Chapter 3). There is considerable overlap of signals from different sound sources in the cochlea whereas visual objects typically occupy different retinal regions. There is another important issue – when listeners attend to one audi- tory input, how much processing is there of the unattended input(s)? As we will see, various answers have been proposed. Cherry (1953) addressed the issues discussed so far (see Eysenck, 2015, for an evaluation of his research). He studied the cocktail party problem using a dichotic listening task in which a different auditory message was presented to each ear and the listener attended to only one. Listeners engaged in shadowing (repeating the attended message aloud as it was pre- sented) to ensure their attention was directed to that message. However, the shadowing task has two potential disadvantages: (1) listeners do not KEY TERMS Cocktail party problem The difficulties involved in attending to one voice when two or more people are speaking at the same time.

Listeners solved the cocktail party problem by using differences between the auditory inputs in physical features (e.g., sex of speaker; voice intensity; speaker location). When these physical differences were eliminated by pre- senting two messages in the same voice to both ears at once, listeners found it very hard to separate out the messages based on differences in meaning. Cherry (1953) found very little information seemed to be extracted from the unattended message. Listeners seldom noticed when it was spoken backwards or in a foreign language. However, physical changes (e.g., a pure tone) were nearly always detected. The conclusion that unattended information receives minimal processing was supported by Moray (1959), who found listeners remembered very few words presented 35 times each. Where is the bottleneck? Early vs late selection Many psychologists have argued we have a processing bottleneck (discussed below). A bottleneck in the road (e.g., where it is especially narrow) can cause traffic congestion, and a bottleneck in the processing system seriously limits our ability to process two (or more) simultaneous inputs. However, it would sometimes solve the cocktail problem by permitting listeners to process only the desired voice. Where is the bottleneck? Broadbent (1958) argued a filter (bottleneck) early in processing allows information from one input or message through it based on the message’s physical characteristics. The other input remains briefly in a sensory buffer and is rejected unless attended to rapidly (see Figure 5.1). Thus, Broadbent argued there is early selection. Treisman (1964) argued the bottleneck’s location is more flexible than Broadbent suggested (see Figure 5.1). She claimed listeners start with pro- cessing based on physical cues, syllable pattern and specific words and then process grammatical structure and meaning. Later processes are omitted or attenuated if there is insufficient processing capacity to permit full stimulus analysis. Treisman (1964) also argued top-down processes (e.g., expectations) are important. Listeners performing the shadowing task sometimes say a word from the unattended input. Such breakthroughs mostly occur when the word on the unattended channel is highly probable in the context of the attended message. Deutsch and Deutsch (1963) argued all stimuli are fully analysed, with the most important or relevant stimulus determining the response. Thus, they placed the bottleneck much later in processing than did Broadbent (see Figure 5.1). Findings: unattended input Broadbent’s approach predicts little or no processing of unattended audi- tory messages. In contrast, Treisman’s approach suggests flexibility in the processing of unattended messages, whereas Deutsch and Deutsch’s approach implies reasonably thorough processing of such messages. Relevant findings are discussed below.

Treisman and Riley (1969) asked listeners to shadow one of two audi- tory messages. They stopped shadowing and tapped when they detected a target in either message. Many more target words were detected on the shadowed message. Aydelott et al. (2015) asked listeners to perform a task on attended target words. When unattended words related in meaning were presented shortly before the target words themselves, performance on the target words was enhanced when unattended words were presented as loudly as attended ones. Thus, the meaning of unattended words was processed. There is often more processing of unattended words that have a special significance for the listener. For example, Li et al. (2011) obtained evidence that unattended weight-related words (e.g., fat; chunky) were processed more thoroughly by women dissatisfied with their weight. Conway et al. (2001) found listeners often detected their own name on the unattended message. This was especially the case if they had low working memory capacity (see Glossary) indicative of poor attentional control. Coch et al. (2005) asked listeners to attend to one of two auditory inputs and to detect targets presented on either input. Event-related poten- tials (ERPs; see Glossary) provided a measure of processing activity. ERPs 100 ms after target presentation were greater when the target was presented on the attended rather than the unattended message. This suggests there was more processing of the attended than unattended targets. Greater brain activation for attended than unattended auditory stimuli may reflect enhanced processing for attended stimuli and/or suppressed processing for unattended stimuli. Horton et al.

Listeners heard separate speech messages presented to each ear with instructions to attend to the left or right ear. There was greater brain acti- vation associated with the attended message (especially around 90 ms after stimulus presentation). This difference depended on enhancement of the attended message combined with suppression of the unattended message. Classic theories of selective auditory attention (those of Broadbent, Treisman, and Deutsch and Deutsch) de-emphasised the importance of suppression or inhibition of the unattended message shown by Horton et al. (2013). For example, Schwartz and David (2018) reported suppres- sion of neuronal responses in the primary auditory cortex to distractor sounds. More generally, all the classic theories de-emphasise the flexibility of selective auditory attention and the role of top-down processes in selec- tion (see below). Findings: cocktail party problem Humans are generally very good at separating out and understanding one voice from several speaking at the same time (i.e., solving the cocktail party problem). The extent of this achievement is indicated by the finding that automatic speech recognition systems are considerably inferior to human speech recognition (Spille & Meyer, 2014). Mesgarani and Chang (2012) studied listeners with implanted multi- electrode arrays permitting the direct recording of activity within the audi- tory cortex. They heard two different messages (one in a male voice; one in a female voice) presented to the same ear with instructions to attend to only one. The responses within the auditory cortex revealed “The salient spectral [based on sound frequencies] and temporal features of the attended speaker, as if subjects were listening to that speaker alone” (Mesgarani & Chang, 2012, p. 233). Listeners found it easy to distinguish between the two messages in the study by Mesgarani and Chang (2012) because they differed in physical characteristics (i.e., male vs female voice). Olguin et al. (2018) presented native English speakers with two messages in different female voices. The attended message was always in English whereas the unattended message was in English or an unknown language. Comprehension of the attended message was comparable in both conditions. However, there was stronger neural encoding of both messages in the former condition. As Olguin et al. concluded, “The results offer strong support to flexible accounts of selec- tive [auditory] attention” (p. 1618). In everyday life, we are often confronted by several different speech streams. Accordingly, Puvvada and Simon (2017) presented three speech streams and assessed brain activity as listeners attended to only one. Early in processing, “the auditory cortex maintains an acoustic representation of the auditory scene with no significant preference to attended over ignored sources” (p. 9195). Later in processing, “Higher-order auditory cortical areas represent an attended speech stream separately from, and with signifi- cantly higher fidelity [accuracy] than, unattended speech streams” (p. 9189). This latter finding results from top-down processes (e.g., attention). How do we solve the cocktail party problem?

Various top-down factors based on listeners’ knowledge and/or expectations are involved. For example, lis- teners are more accurate at identifying what one speaker is saying in the context of several other voices if they have previously heard that speaker’s voice in isolation (McDermott, 2009). Woods and McDermott (2018) investigated top-down processes in selective auditory attention in more detail. They argued, “Sounds pro- duced by a given source often exhibit consistencies in structure that might be useful in separating sources” (p. E3313). They used the term “schemas” to refer to such structural consistencies. Listeners showed clear evidence of schema learning leading to rapid improvements in their listening performance. An important aspect of such learning is temporal coherence – a given source’s sound features are typ- ically all present when it is active and absent when it is silent. Shamma et al. (2011) discussed research showing that if listeners can identify one distinctive feature of the target voice, they can then distinguish its other sound features via temporal coherence. Evans et al. (2016) compared patterns of brain activity when attended speech was presented on its own or together with competing unattended speech. Brain areas associated with attentional and control processes (e.g., frontal and parietal regions) were more activated in the latter condition. Thus, top-down processes relating to attention and control are important in selective auditory processing. Finally, Golumbic et al. (2013) suggested individuals at actual cocktail parties can potentially use visual information to assist them in understand- ing what a given speaker is saying. Listeners heard two simultaneous mes- sages (one in a male voice and the other in a female voice). Processing of the attended message was enhanced when they saw a video of the speaker talking. In sum, listeners generally achieve the complex task of selecting one speech message from among several such messages. There has been pro- gress in identifying the top-down processes involved. For example, if lis- teners can identify at least one consistently distinctive feature of the target voice, this makes it easier for them to attend only to that voice. Top-down processes often produce a “winner-takes-all” situation where the processing of one auditory input (the winner) suppresses the brain activity associated with all other inputs (Kurt et al., 2008). FOCUSED VISUAL ATTENTION There has been much more research on visual attention than auditory atten- tion. The main reason is that vision is our most important sense modality with more of the cortex devoted to it than any other sense. Here we con- sider four key issues. First, what is focused visual attention like? Second, what is selected in focused visual attention? Third, what happens to unat- tended visual stimuli? Fourth, what are the major systems involved in visual attention? In the next section (see pp. 196–200), we discuss what the study of visual disorders has taught us about visual attention.

Was your visual attention like a spotlight? A spotlight illuminates a fairly small area, little can be seen outside its beam and it can be redirected to focus on any given object. Posner (1980) argued the same is true of visual attention. Other psychologists (e.g., Eriksen & St. James, 1986) claim visual attention is more flexible than suggested by the spotlight analogy and argue visual attention resembles a zoom lens. We can increase or decrease the area of focal attention just as a zoom lens can be adjusted to alter the visual area it covers. This makes sense. For example, car drivers often need to narrow their attention after spotting a potential hazard. A third theoretical approach is even more flexible. According to the multiple spotlights theory (Awh & Pashler, 2000), we sometimes exhibit split attention (attention directed to two or more non-adjacent regions in space). The notion of split attention is controversial. Jans et al. (2010) argued attention is often strongly linked to motor action and so attending to two separate objects might disrupt effective action. However, there is no strong evidence for such disruption. Findings Support for the zoom-lens model was reported by Müller et al. (2003). On each trial, observers saw four squares in a semi-circle and were cued to attend to one, two or all four. Four objects were then presented (one in each square) and observers decided whether a target (e.g., a white circle) was among them. Brain activation in early visual areas was most wide- spread when the attended region was large (i.e., attend to all four squares) and was most limited when it was small (i.e., attend to one square). As pre- dicted by the zoom-lens theory, performance (reaction times and errors) was best with the smallest attended region and worst with the largest one. Chen and Cave (2016, p. 1822) argued the optimal attentional zoom setting “includes all possible target locations and excludes possible distrac- tor locations”. Most findings indicated people’s attentional zoom setting is close to optimal. However, Collegio et al. (2019) obtained contrary findings. Drawings of large objects (e.g., jukebox) and small objects (e.g., watch) were presented so their retinal size was the same. The observer’s area of focal attention was greater with large objects because they made top-down inferences concerning their real-world sizes. As a result, the area of focal attention was larger than optimal for large objects. Goodhew et al. (2016) pointed out that nearly all research has focused only on spatial perception (e.g., identification of a specific object). They focused on temporal perception (was a disc presented continuously or were there two presentations separated by a brief interval?). Spotlight size had no effect on temporal acuity, which is inconsistent with the theory. How can we explain these findings? Spatial resolution is poor in peripheral vision but temporal resolution is good. As a consequence, a small atten- tional spotlight is more beneficial for spatial than temporal acuity. We turn now to split attention. Suppose you had to identify two digits that would probably be presented to two cued locations a little way apart KEY TERM Split attention Allocation of attention to two (or more) non- adjacent regions of visual space.

(b) Probability of target detection at valid (left or right) and invalid (near or far) locations. Based on information in Awh and Pashler (2000). (see Figure 5.2a). Suppose also that on some trials a digit was presented between the two cued locations. According to zoom-lens theory, the area of maximal attention should include the two cued locations and the space in between. As a result, the detection of digits presented in the middle should have been very good. In fact, Awh and Pashler (2000) found it was poor (see Figure 5.2b). Thus, attention can resemble multiple spotlights, as predicted by the split-attention approach. Morawetz et al. (2007) presented letters and digits at five locations simultaneously (one in each quadrant of the visual field and one in the centre). In one condition, observers attended to the visual stimuli at the upper left and bottom right locations and ignored the other stimuli. There were two peaks of brain activation corresponding to the attended areas but less activation corresponding to the region in between. Overall, the pattern of activation strongly suggested split attention. Niebergall et al. (2011) recorded the neuronal responses of monkeys attending to two moving stimuli while ignoring a distractor. In the key condition, there was a distractor between (and close to) the two attended stimuli. In this condition, neuronal responses to the distractor decreased compared to other conditions. Thus, split attention involves a mecha- nism reducing attention to (and processing of) distractors located between attended stimuli.

Note that the right hemisphere receives visual signals from the left hemifield and the left hemisphere receives signals from the right hemifield. Walter et al. (2016) found per- formance was better when non-adjacent stimuli were presented to different hemifields rather than the same hemifield. Of most importance, the assess- ment of brain activity indicated effective filtering or inhibition of stimuli presented between the two attended stimuli only when presented to differ- ent hemifields. In sum, we can use visual attention very flexibly. Visual selective atten- tion can resemble a spotlight, a zoom lens or multiple spotlights, depending on the current situation and the observer’s goals. However, split attention may require that two stimuli are presented to different hemifields rather than the same one. A limitation with all these theories is that metaphors (e.g., attention is a zoom lens) are used to describe experimental findings but these metaphors fail to specify the underlying mechanisms (Di Lollo, 2018). What is selected? Why might selective attention resemble a spotlight or zoom lens? Perhaps we selectively attend to an area or region of space: space-based attention. Alternatively, we may attend to a given object or objects: object-based attention. Object-based attention is prevalent in everyday life because visual attention is mainly concerned with objects of interest to us (see Chapters 2 and 3). As expected, observers’ eye movements as they view natural scenes are directed almost exclusively to objects (Henderson & Hollingworth, 1999). However, even though we typically focus on objects of potential importance, our attentional system is so flexible we can attend to an area of space or a given object. There is also feature-based attention. For example, suppose you are looking for a friend in a crowd. Since she nearly always wears red clothes, you might attend to the feature of colour rather than specific objects or locations. Leonard et al. (2015) asked observers to identify a red letter within a series of rapidly presented letters. Performance was impaired when a # symbol also coloured red was presented very shortly before the target. Thus, there was evidence for feature-based attention (e.g., colour; motion). Findings Visual attention is often object-based. For example, O’Craven et al. (1999) presented observers with two stimuli (a face and a house), transparently overlapping at the same location, with instructions to attend to one of them. Brain areas associated with face processing were more activated when the face was attended to than when the house was. Similarly, brain areas associated with house processing were activated when the house was the focus of attention. Egly et al. (1994) devised a much-used method for comparing object- based and space-based attention (see Figure 5.3). The task was to select a target stimulus as rapidly as possible.

Of key importance, invalid cues were in the same object as the target (within-object cues) or in a different object (between-object cues). The key finding was that target detection was faster on invalid trials when the cue was in the same object rather than a different one. Thus, attention was at least partly object-based. Does object-based attention in the Egly et al. (1994) task occur fairly “automatically” or does it involve strategic processes? Object- based attention should always be found if it is automatic. Drummond and Shomstein (2010) found no evidence for object-based attention when the cue indicated with 100% certainty where the target would appear. Thus, any preference for object-based attention can be overridden when appropriate. Hollingworth et al. (2012) found evidence object-based and space-based attention can occur at the same time using a task resembling that of Egly et al. (1994). There were three types of within-object cues varying in the distance between the cue and subsequent target (see Figure 5.4). There was evidence for object-based attention: when the target was far from the cue, performance was worse when the cue was in a different object rather than the same one. There was also evidence for space-based attention: when the target was in the same object as the cue, performance declined the greater the distance between target and cue. Thus, object-based and space-based attention are not mutually exclusive. Similar findings were reported by Kimchi et al. (2016). Observers responded faster to a target presented within rather than outside an object. This indicates object-based attention. There was also evidence for space- based attention: when targets were presented outside the object, observ- ers responded faster when they were close to it. Kimchi et al. concluded that “object-related and space-related attentional processing can operate simultaneously” (p. 48). Pilz et al. (2012) compared object-based and space-based attention using various tasks. Overall, there was much more evidence of space-based than object-based attention, with only a small fraction of participants showing clear-cut evidence of object-based attention. Donovan et al. (2017) noted that most studies indicating visual atten- tion is object-based have used spatial cues, which may bias the allocation of attention. Donovan et al. avoided the use of spatial cues and found “Object-based representations do not guide attentional selection in the absence of spatial cues” (p. 762). This finding suggests previous research has exaggerated the extent of object-based visual attention. When we search the visual environment, it would be inefficient if we repeatedly attended to any given location. In fact, we exhibit inhibition of return (a reduced probability of returning to a region recently the focus of attention). Of theoretical importance is whether inhibition of return applies Figure 5.3 Stimuli adapted from Egly et al. (1994). Participants saw two rectangles and a cue indicated the most likely location of a subsequent target. The target appeared at the cued location (V), at the uncued end of the cued rectangle (IS) or at the uncued, equidistant end of the uncued rectangle (ID).

List and Robertson (2007) used Egly et al.’s (1994) task shown in Figure 5.4 and found location- or space-based inhibition of return was much stronger than object-based inhibition of return. Theeuwes et al. (2014) found location- and object-based inhibition of return were both present at the same time. According to Theeuwes et al. (p. 2254), “If you direct your attention to a location in space, you will automatically direct attention to any object . . . present at that location, and vice versa.” There is considerable evidence of feature-based attention (see Bartsch et al., 2018, for a review).

They discovered the latter was the case. Finally, Chen and Zelinsky (2019) argued it is important to study the allocation of attention under more naturalistic conditions than those typ- ically used in research. In their study, observers engaged in free (uncon- strained) viewing of natural scenes. Eye-fixation data suggested that attention initially selects regions of space. These regions may provide “the perceptual fragments from which objects are built” (p. 148). Evaluation Research on whether visual attention is object- or location-based have produced variable findings and so few definitive conclusions are pos- sible. However, the relative importance of object-based and space- or location-based attention is flexible. For example, individual differences are important (Pilz et al., 2012). Note that visual attention can be both object- based and space-based at the same time. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, most research apparently demonstrating that object-based attention is more important than space- or location-based attention has involved the use of spatial cues. Recent evidence (Donovan et al., 2017) suggests such cues may bias visual attention and that visual attention is not initially object-based in their absence. Second, space-, object- and feature-based forms of attention often inter- act with each other to enhance object processing (Kravitz & Behrmann, 2011). However, we have as yet limited theoretical understanding of the mechanisms involved in such interactions. Third, there is a need for more research assessing patterns of attention under naturalistic conditions. In recent research where observers view artifi- cial stimuli while performing a specific task, it is unclear whether attentional processes resemble those when they engage in free viewing of natural scenes. What happens to unattended or distracting stimuli? Unsurprisingly, unattended visual stimuli receive less processing than attended ones. Martinez et al. (1999) compared event-related potentials (ERPs) to attended and unattended visual stimuli. The ERPs to unattended visual stimuli were comparable to those to attended ones 50–55 ms after stimulus onset. After that, however, the ERPs to attended stimuli were greater than those to unattended stimuli. Thus, selective attention influ- ences all but the very early stages of processing. As we have all discovered to our cost, it is often hard (or impossible) to ignore task-irrelevant stimuli. Below we consider factors determining whether task performance is adversely affected by distracting stimuli. Load theory Lavie’s (2005, 2010) load theory has been an influential approach to understanding distraction effects.

Perceptual load refers to the perceptual demands of a current task. Cognitive load refers to the burden placed on the cognitive system by a current task (e.g., demands on working memory). Tasks involving high perceptual load require nearly all our perceptual capacity whereas low-load tasks do not. With low-load tasks there are spare attentional resources, and so task-irrelevant stimuli are more likely to be processed. In contrast, tasks involving high cognitive load reduce our ability to use cognitive control to discriminate between target and distrac- tor stimuli. Thus, high perceptual load is associated with low distractibility, whereas high cognitive load is associated with high distractibility. Findings There is much support for the hypothesis that high perceptual load reduces distraction effects. Forster and Lavie (2008) presented six letters in a circle and participants decided which target letter (X or N) was present. The five non-target letters resembled the target letter more closely in the high-load condition. On some trials a picture of a cartoon character (e.g., Spongebob Squarepants) was presented as a distractor outside the circle. Distractors interfered with task performance only under low-load conditions. According to the theory, brain activation associated with distractors should be less when individuals are performing a task involving high per- ceptual load. This finding has been obtained with visual tasks and distrac- tors (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2005) and also with auditory tasks and distractors (e.g., Sabri et al., 2013). Why is low perceptual load associated with high distractibility? Biggs and Gibson (2018) argued this happens because observers generally adopt a broad attentional focus when perceptual load is low. They tested this hypothesis using three low-load conditions in which participants decided whether a target X or N was presented and a distractor letter was some- times presented (see Figure 5.5). They argued that observers would adopt the smallest attentional focus in the circle condition and the largest atten- tional focus in the solo condition. As predicted, distractor interference was greatest in the solo condition and least in the circle condition. Thus, dis- traction effects depend strongly on size of attentional focus as well as per- ceptual load. The hypothesis that distraction effects should be greater when cognitive or working memory load is high rather than low was tested by Burnham et al. (2014). As predicted, distraction effects on a visual search task were Figure 5.5 Sample displays for three low perceptual load conditions in which the task required deciding whether a target X or N was presented.

Sörqvist et al. (2016) argued high cognitive load can reduce rather than increase distraction. They pointed out that cognitive load is typically asso- ciated with high levels of concentration and our everyday experience indi- cates high concentration generally reduces distractibility. As predicted, they found neural activation associated with auditory distractors was reduced when cognitive load on a visual task was high rather than low. The effects of cognitive load on distraction are very variable. How can we explain this variability? Sörqvist et al. (2016) argued that an impor- tant factor is how easily distracting stimuli can be distinguished from task stimuli. When it is easy (e.g., task and distracting stimuli are in differ- ent modalities as in the Sörqvist et al., 2016, study), high cognitive load reduces distraction. In contrast, when it is hard to distinguish between task and distracting stimuli (e.g., they are similar and/or in the same modality), then high cognitive load increases distraction. Load theory assumes the effects of perceptual and cognitive load are independent. However, Linnell and Caparos (2011) found perceptual and cognitive processes interacted: perceptual load only influenced attention as predicted when cognitive load was low. Thus, the effects of perceptual load are not “automatic” as assumed theoretically but instead depend on cogni- tive resources being available. Evaluation The distinction between perceptual and cognitive load has proved useful in predicting when distraction effects will be small or large. More specifi- cally, the prediction that high perceptual load is associated with reduced distraction effects has received much empirical support. In applied research, load theory successfully predicts several aspects of drivers’ attention and behaviour (Murphy & Greene, 2017). For example, drivers exposed to high perceptual load responded more slowly to hazards and drove less safely. What are the theory’s limitations? First, the terms “perceptual load” and “cognitive load” are vague, making it hard to test the theory (Murphy et al., 2016). Second, the assumption that perceptual and cognitive load have separate effects on attention is incorrect (Linnell & Caparos, 2011). Third, perceptual load and attentional breadth are often confounded. Fourth, the prediction that high cognitive load is associated with high distractibility has been disproved when task and distracting stimuli are easily distinguishable. Fifth, the theory de-emphasises several relevant factors including the salience or conspicuousness of distracting stimuli and the spatial distance between distracting and task stimuli (Murphy et al., 2016). Major attention networks As we saw in Chapter 1, many cognitive processes are associated with net- works spread across relatively large areas of cortex rather than small, spe- cific regions. With respect to attention, several theorists (e.g., Posner, 1980; Corbetta & Shulman, 2002) have argued there are two major networks.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43.\n\n192 Visual perception and attention One attention network is goal-directed or endogenous whereas the other is stimulus-driven or exogenous. Posner’s (1980) approach Posner (1980) studied covert attention in which attention shifts to a given spatial location without an accompanying eye movement. In his research, people responded rapidly to a light. The light was preceded by a central cue (arrow pointing to the left or right) or a peripheral cue (brief illumina- tion of a box outline). Most cues were valid (i.e., indicating where the target light would appear) but some were invalid (i.e., providing inaccurate infor- mation about the light’s location). Responses to the light were fastest to valid cues, intermediate to neutral cues (a central cross) and slowest to invalid cues. The findings were com- parable for central and peripheral cues. When the cues were valid on only a small fraction of trials, they were ignored when they were central cues. However, they influenced performance when they were peripheral cues. The above findings led Posner (1980) to distinguish between two atten- tion systems: (1) An endogenous system: it is controlled by the individual’s intentions and is used when central cues are presented. (2) An exogenous system: it automatically shifts attention and is involved when uninformative peripheral cues are presented. Stimuli that are salient or different from other stimuli (e.g., in colour) are most likely to be attended to using this system. Corbetta and Shulman’s (2002) approach Corbetta and Shulman (2002) identified two attention systems that are involved in basic aspects of visual processing. First, there is a goal-directed or top-down system resembling Posner’s endogenous system. This dorsal attention network consists of a fronto-parietal network including the intra- parietal sulcus. It is influenced by expectations, knowledge and current goals. It is used when a cue predicts the location or other feature of a forth- coming visual stimulus. Second, Corbetta and Shulman (2002) identified a stimulus-driven or bottom-up attention system resembling Posner’s exogenous system. This is the ventral attention network and consists primarily of a right- hemisphere ventral fronto-parietal network. This system is used when an unexpected and potentially important stimulus (e.g., flames appearing under the door) occurs. Thus, it has a “circuit-breaking” function, meaning visual atten- tion is redirected from its current focus. What stimuli trigger this circuit- breaking? According to Corbetta et al. (2008), non-task stimuli (i.e., distractors) closely resembling task stimuli are especially likely to activate the ventral attention network although salient or conspicuous stimuli also activate the same network. Corbetta and Shulman (2011; see Figure 5.6) identified the brain areas associated with each network. Key areas within the dorsal attention network are as follows: superior parietal lobule (SPL), intraparietal sulcus KEY TERM Covert attention Attention to an object in the absence of an eye movement towards it.

Key areas within the ventral attention network are as follows: inferior frontal junction (IFJ), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and insula (Ins). The temporo-parietal junction also forms part of the ventral attention network. The existence of two attention networks makes much sense. The goal-directed system (dorsal attention network) allows us to attend to stimuli directly relevant to our current goals. If we only had this system, however, our attentional processes would be dangerously inflexible. It is also important to have a stimulus-driven attentional system (ventral atten- tion network) leading us to switch attention away from goal-relevant stimuli to unexpected threatening stimuli (e.g., a ferocious animal). More generally, the two attention networks typically interact effectively with each other. Findings Corbetta and Shulman (2002) supported their two-network model by car- rying out meta-analyses of brain-imaging studies. In essence, they argued, brain areas most often activated when participants expect a stimulus that has not yet been presented form the dorsal attention network. In contrast, brain areas most often activated when individuals detect low-frequency targets form the ventral attention network. Hahn et al. (2006) tested Corbetta and Shulman’s (2002) theory by comparing patterns of brain activation when top-down and bottom-up processes were required. As predicted, there was little overlap between the brain areas associated with top-down and bottom-up processing. In addi- tion, the brain areas involved in each type of processing corresponded rea- sonably well to those identified by Corbetta and Shulman. Chica et al. (2013) reviewed research on the two attention systems and identified 15 differences between them. For example, stimulus-driven atten- tion is faster than top-down attention and is more object-based. In addi- tion, it is more resistant to interference from other peripheral cues once activated. The existence of so many differences strengthens the argument the two attentional systems are separate. Considerable research evidence (mostly involving neuroimaging) indi- cates the dorsal and ventral attention systems are associated with distinct Figure 5.6 The brain areas associated with the dorsal or goal- directed attention network and the ventral or stimulus- driven network.

However, neuroimaging studies cannot establish that any given brain area is necessar- ily involved in stimulus-driven or goal-directed attention processes. Chica et al. (2011) provided relevant evidence by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) to interfere with processing in a given brain area. TMS applied to the right temporo-parietal junction impaired the functioning of the stimulus-driven system but not the top-down one. In the same study, Chica et al. (2011) found TMS applied to the right intraparietal sulcus impaired the functioning of both attention systems. This provides evidence of the two attention systems working together. Evidence from brain-damaged patients (discussed below, see pp. 196–200) is also relevant to establishing the brain areas necessarily involved in goal- directed or stimulus-driven attentional processes. Shomstein et al. (2010) had brain-damaged patients complete two tasks, one requiring stimulus- driven attentional processes whereas the other required top-down processes. Patients having greater problems with top-down attentional processing typ- ically had brain damage to the superior parietal lobule (part of the dorsal attention network). In contrast, patients having greater problems with stimulus-driven attentional processing typically had brain damage to the temporo- parietal junction (part of the ventral attention network). Wen et al. (2012) investigated interactions between the two visual atten- tion systems. They assessed brain activation while participants responded to target stimuli in one visual field while ignoring all stimuli in the unattended visual field. There were two main findings. First, stronger causal influences of the top-down system on the stimulus-driven system led to superior per- formance on the task. This finding suggests the appearance of an object at the attended location caused the top-down attention system to suppress activity within the stimulus-driven system. Second, stronger causal influences of the stimulus-driven system on the top-down system were associated with impaired task performance. This finding suggests activation within the stimulus-driven system pro- duced by stimuli not in attentional focus disrupted the attentional set maintained by the top-down system. Recent developments Corbetta and Shulman’s (2002) theoretical approach has been developed in recent years. Here we briefly consider three such developments. First, we now have a greater understanding of interactions between their two atten- tion networks. Meyer et al. (2018) found stimulus-driven and goal-directed attention both activated frontal and parietal regions within the dorsal attention network, suggesting it has a pivotal role in integrating bottom-up and top-down processing. Second, previous research reviewed by Corbetta and Shulman (2002) indicated the dorsal attention network is active immediately prior to the presentation of an anticipated visual stimulus. However, this research did not indicate how long this attention network remained active. Meehan et al. (2017) addressed this issue and discovered that top-down influences associated within the dorsal attention network persisted over a relatively long time period.

One such network is the cingulo-opercular network including the anterior insula/operculum and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; see Figure 5.7). This network is associated with non-selective attention or alertness (Coste & Kleinschmidt, 2016). Another additional network is the default mode network including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the lateral parietal cortex (LP), the inferior temporal cortex (IT), the medial prefrontal cortex (MPF) and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). The default mode network is activated during internally focused cognitive processes (e.g., mind- wandering; imagining the future). What is the relevance of this network to attention? In essence, performance on tasks requiring externally focused attention is often enhanced if the default mode network is deactivated (Amer et al., 2016a). Finally, there is the fronto-parietal network (Dosenbach et al., 2008), which includes the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (aDLPFC), the KEY TERM Default mode network A network of brain regions that is active “by default” when an individual is not involved in a current task; it is associated with internal processes including mind- wandering, remembering the past and imagining the future.

It is associated with top-down attentional and cognitive control. Evaluation The theoretical approach proposed by Corbetta and Shulman (2002) has several successes to its credit. First, there is convincing evidence for some- what separate stimulus-driven and top-down attention systems, each with its own brain network. Second, research using transcranial magnetic stimu- lation suggests major brain areas within each attention system play a causal role in attentional processes. Third, some interactions between the two net- works have been identified. Fourth, research on brain-damaged patients supports the theoretical approach (see next section, pp. 196–200). What are the limitations of this theoretical approach? First, the precise brain areas associated with each attentional system have not been clearly identified. Second, there is more commonality (especially within the pari- etal lobe) in the brain areas associated with the two attention networks than assumed theoretically by Corbetta and Shulman (2002). Third, there are additional attention-related brain networks not included within the original theory. Fourth, much remains to be discovered about how differ- ent attention systems interact. DISORDERS OF VISUAL ATTENTION Here we consider two important attentional disorders in brain-damaged individuals: neglect and extinction. Neglect (or spatial neglect) involves a lack of awareness of stimuli presented to the side of space on the oppo- site side to the brain damage (the contralesional side). This occurs because information from the left side of the visual field proceeds to the right hemisphere. Most neglect patients have damage in the right hemisphere and so lack awareness of stimuli on the left side of the visual field: space-based or egocentric neglect. For example, patients crossing out targets presented to their left or right side (cancellation task) cross out more of those presented to the right. When instructed to mark the centre of a horizontal line (line bisection task), patients put it to the right of the centre. Note that the right hemisphere is dominant in spatial attention in healthy individuals – they exhibit pseudo-neglect, in which the left side of visual space is favoured (Friedrich et al., 2018). There is also object-centred or allocentric neglect involving a lack of awareness of the left side of objects (see Figure 5.8). Patients with right-hemisphere damage typically draw the right side of all figures in a multi-object scene but neglect their left side in the left and right visual fields (Gainotti & Ciaraffa, 2013). Do allocentric and egocentric neglect reflect a single disorder or sepa- rate disorders? Rorden et al. (2012) obtained two findings supporting the single disorder explanation. First, the correlation between the extent of each form of neglect across 33 patients was +.80. Second, similar brain regions were associated with each type of neglect. However, Pedrazzini et al. (2017) found damage to the intraparietal sulcus was more associated KEY TERMS Neglect A disorder involving right-hemisphere damage (typically) in which the left side of objects and/ or objects presented to the left visual field are undetected; the condition resembles extinction but is more severe.

Extinction is often found in neglect patients. Extinction involves a failure to detect a stimulus presented to the side opposite the brain damage when a second stimulus is presented to the same side as the brain damage. Extinction and neglect are closely related but separate deficits (de Haan et al., 2012). We will focus mostly on neglect because it has attracted much more research. Which brain areas are damaged in neglect patients? Neglect is a het- erogeneous condition and the brain areas damaged vary considerably across patients. In a meta-analysis, Molenberghs et al. (2012) found the main areas damaged in neglect patients are in the right hemisphere and include the superior temporal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the insula, the supramarginal gyrus and the angular gyrus (gyrus means ridge). Nearly all these areas are within the stimulus-driven or ventral attention network (see Figure 5.6) suggesting brain networks are damaged rather than simply specific brain areas (Corbetta & Shulman, 2011). We also need to consider functional connectivity (correlated brain activity between brain regions). Baldassarre et al. (2014, 2016) discovered widespread disruption of functional connectivity between the hemispheres in neglect patients. This disruption did not involve the bottom-up and top- down attention networks. Of importance, recovery from attention deficits in neglect patients was associated with improvements in functional con- nectivity in bottom-up and top-down attention networks (Ramsey et al., 2016). The right-hemisphere temporo-parietal junction and intraparietal sulcus are typically damaged in extinction patients (de Haan et al., 2012). When transcranial magnetic stimulation is applied to these areas to interfere with processing, extinction-like behaviour results (de Haan et al., 2012). Dugué et al. (2018) confirmed the importance of the temporo-parietal junction Figure 5.8 On the left is a copying task in which a patient with unilateral neglect distorted or ignored the left side of the figures to be copied (shown on the left).

However, its subregions varied in terms of their involvement in voluntary and involuntary attention shifts. Conscious awareness and processing Neglect patients generally report no conscious awareness of stimuli pre- sented to the left visual field. However, that does not necessarily mean those stimuli are not processed. Vuilleumier et al. (2002b) presented extinction patients with two pictures at the same time, one to each visual field. The patients showed very little memory for left-field stimuli. Then the patients identified degraded pictures. There was a facilitation effect for left-field pic- tures indicating they had been processed. Vuilleumier et al. (2002a) presented GK, a male patient with neglect and extinction, with fearful faces. He showed increased activation in the amygdala (associated with emotional responses) whether or not these faces were consciously perceived. This is explicable given there is a processing route from the retina to the amygdala bypassing the cortex (Diano et al., 2017). Sarri et al. (2010) found extinction patients had no awareness of left- field stimuli. However, these stimuli were associated with activation in early visual processing areas, indicating they received some processing. Processing in neglect and extinction has been investigated using event-related potentials. Di Russo et al. (2008) focused on the processing of left-field stimuli not consciously perceived by neglect patients. Early processing of these stimuli was comparable to that of healthy controls with only later processing being disrupted. Lasaponara et al. (2018) obtained similar findings in neglect patients. In healthy individuals, the presentation of left-field targets inhibits processing of right-field space. This was less the case in neglect patients, which helps to explain their lack of conscious perception of left-field stimuli. Theoretical considerations Corbetta and Shulman (2011) discussed neglect in the context of their two-system theory (discussed earlier, see pp. 192–196). In essence, the bottom-up ventral attention network is damaged. Strong support for this assumption was reported by Toba et al. (2018a) who found in 25 neglect patients that impaired performance on tests of neglect was associated with damage to parts of the ventral attention network (e.g., angular gyrus; supramarginal gyrus). Since the right hemisphere is dominant in the ventral attention network, neglect patients typically have damage in that hem- isphere. Of importance, Corbetta and Shulman (2011) also assumed that damage to the ventral network impairs the functioning of the goal-directed dorsal attention network (even though not itself damaged). How does the damaged ventral attention network impair the dorsal attention network’s functioning? The two attention networks interact and so damage to the ventral network inevitably affects the functioning of the dorsal network. More specifically, damage to the ventral attention network “impairs non-spatial [across the entire visual field] functions, hypoactivates Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43.","evidence":["the brain damage.","Interactive feature: Primal Pictures’ 3D atlas of the brain Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43."]}

(2012) proposed a theory of extinction based on two major assumptions: (1) “Extinction is a consequence of biased competition for attention between the ipsilesional [right-field] and contralesional [left-field] target stimuli” (p. 1048); (2) Extinction patients have much reduced attentional capacity so often only one target [the right-field one] can be detected. Findings According to Corbetta and Shulman (2011), the dorsal attention network in neglect patients functions poorly because of reduced activation in the right hemisphere and associated reduced alertness and attentional resources. Thus, increasing patients’ general alertness should enhance their detection of left-field visual targets. Robertson et al. (1998) found the slower detec- tion of left visual field stimuli compared to those in the right visual field was no longer present when warning sounds were used to increase alertness. Bonato and Cutini (2016) compared neglect patients’ ability to detect visual targets with (or without) a second, attentionally demanding task. Detection rates were high for targets presented to the right visual field in both conditions. In contrast, patients detected only approximately 50% as many targets in the left visual field as the right when performing another task. Thus, neglect patients have limited attentional resources. Corbetta and Shulman (2011) assumed neglect patients have an essen- tially intact dorsal attention network. Accordingly, neglect patients might use that network effectively if steps were taken to facilitate its use. Duncan et al. (1999) presented arrays of letters and neglect patients recalled only those in a pre-specified colour (the dorsal attention network could be used to select the appropriate letters). Neglect patients resembled healthy con- trols in showing equal recall of letters presented to each side of visual space. The two attention networks typically work closely together. Bays et al. (2010) studied neglect patients. They used eye movements during a visual search to assess patients’ problems with top-down and stimulus-driven attentional processes. Both types of attentional processes were equally impaired (as predicted by Corbetta and Shulman, 2011). Of most impor- tance, there was a remarkably high correlation of +.98 between these two types of attentional deficit. Toba et al. (2018b) identified two reasons for the failure of neglect patients to detect left-field stimuli: (1) a “magnetic” attraction of attention (i.e., right-field stimuli immedi- ately capture attention). (2) impaired spatial working memory making it hard for patients to keep track of the locations of stimuli. Both reasons were equally applicable to most patients.

Accordingly, Toba et al. argued we should develop multi-component models of visual neglect to account for such individual differences. We turn now to extinction patients. According to de Haan et al. (2012), extinction occurs because of biased competition between stimuli. If two stimuli could be integrated, that might minimise competition and so reduce extinction. Riddoch et al. (2006) tested this prediction by present- ing objects used together often (e.g., wine bottle and wine glass) or never used together (e.g., wine bottle and ball). Extinction patients identified both objects more often in the former condition than the latter (65% vs 40%, respectively). The biased competition hypothesis has been tested in other ways. We can impair attentional processes in the intact left hemisphere by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation to it. This should reduce competition from the left hemisphere in extinction patients and thus reduce extinction. Some findings are consistent with this prediction (Oliveri & Caltagirone, 2006). de Haan et al. (2012) also identified reduced attentional capacity as a factor causing extinction. Bonato et al. (2010) studied extinction with or without the addition of a second, attentionally demanding task. As pre- dicted, extinction patients showed a substantial increase in the extinction rate (from 18% to over 80%) with this additional task. Overall evaluation Research has produced several important findings. First, neglect and extinction patients can process unattended visual stimuli in the absence of conscious awareness of those stimuli. Second, most neglect patients have damage to the ventral attention network leading to impaired functioning of the undamaged dorsal attention network. Third, extinction occurs because of biased competition for attention and reduced attentional capacity. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, it is hard to produce theoretical accounts applicable to all neglect or extinction patients because the precise symptoms and regions of brain damage vary considerably across patients. Second, neglect patients vary in their precise processing deficits (e.g., Toba et al., 2018b), but this has been de-emphasised in most theories. Third, the precise relationship between neglect and extinction remains unclear. Fourth, the dorsal and ventral networks generally interact but the extent of their interactions remains to be determined. VISUAL SEARCH We spend much time searching for various objects (e.g., a friend in a crowd). The processes involved have been studied in research on visual search where a specified target is detected as rapidly as possible. Initially, we consider an important real-world situation where visual search can be literally a matter of life-or-death: airport security checks. After that, we consider an early very influential theory of visual search before discussing more recent theoretical and empirical developments.

When your luggage is x-rayed, an airport security screener searches for illegal and dangerous items (see Figure 5.9). Screeners are well trained but mistakes sometimes occur. There are two major reasons it is often hard for airport security screeners to detect dangerous items. First, illegal and dangerous items are (thankfully!) present in only a minute fraction of pas- sengers’ luggage. This rarity of targets makes it hard for airport security screeners to detect them. Mitroff and Biggs (2014) asked observers to detect illegal items in bags (see Figure 5.9). The detection rate was only 27% when targets appeared under 0.15% of the time: they termed this the “ultra rare item effect”. In contrast, the detection rate was 92% when targets appeared more than 1% of the time. Peltier and Becker (2016) tested two explanations for the reduced detection rate with rare targets: (1) a reduced probability that the target is fixated (selection error); and (2) increased caution about reporting targets because they are so unexpected (identification error). There was evidence for both explanations. However, most detection failures were selection errors (see Figure 5.10). Figure 5.9 Each bag contains one illegal item.

According to the theory, we need to distinguish between object features (e.g., colour; size; line orientation) and the objects themselves. There are two processing stages: (1) Basic visual features are processed rapidly and pre-attentively in par- allel across the visual scene. (2) Stage (1) is followed by a slower serial process with focused atten- tion providing the “glue” to form objects from the available features (e.g., an object that is round and has an orange colour is perceived as an orange). In the absence of focused attention, features from different objects may be combined randomly producing an illusory conjunction. It follows from the above assumptions that targets defined by a single feature (e.g., a blue letter or an S) should be detected rapidly and in parallel. In contrast, targets defined by a conjunction or combination of features (e.g., a green letter T) should require focused attention and so should be slower to detect. Treisman and Gelade (1980) tested these predictions using both types of targets; the display size was 1–30 items and a target was present or absent. As predicted, response was rapid and there was very little effect of display size when the target was defined by a single feature: these findings suggest parallel processing (see Figure 5.11). Response was slower and was strongly influenced by display size when the target was defined by a con- junction of features: these findings suggest there was serial processing. According to the theory, lack of focused attention can produce illusory conjunctions based on random combinations of features. Friedman-Hill Second, security screeners search for numerous different objects. This increases search difficulty. Menneer et al. (2009) found target detection was worse when screeners searched for two catego- ries of objects (metal threats and improvised explosive devices) rather than one. How can we increase the efficiency of security screening? First, we can exploit individual dif- ferences in the ability to detect targets. Rusconi et al. (2015) found individuals scoring high on a questionnaire measure of attention to detail had superior target-detection performance than low scorers. Second, airport security screeners can find it hard to distinguish between targets (i.e., danger- ous items) and similar-looking non-targets. Geng et al. (2017) found that observers whose training included non-targets resembling targets learned to develop increasingly precise internal target representations. Such representations can improve the speed and accuracy of security screening. Third, the low detection rate when targets are very rare can be addressed. Threat image pro- jection (TIP) can be used to project fictional threat items into x-ray images of luggage to increase the apparent frequency of targets. When screeners are presented with TIPs plus feedback when they miss them, screening performance improves considerably (Hofer & Schwaninger, 2005). In similar fashion, Schwark et al. (2012) found providing false feedback to screeners to indicate they had missed rare targets reduced their cautiousness about reporting targets and improved their performance.

This patient produced many illu- sory conjunctions combining the shape of one stimulus with the colour of another. Limitations What are the theory’s limitations? First, Duncan and Humphreys (1989, 1992) identified two factors not included within feature integration theory: (1) When distractors are very similar to each other, visual search is faster because it is easier to identify them as distractors. (2) The number of distractors has a strong effect on search time to detect even targets defined by a single feature when targets resemble distractors. Second, Treisman and Gelade (1980) estimated the search time with con- junctive targets was approximately 60 ms per item and argued this repre- sented the time taken for focal attention to process each item. However, research with other paradigms indicates it takes approximately 250 ms for attention indexed by eye movements to move from one location to another. Thus, it is improbable focal attention plays the key role assumed within the theory. Third, the theory assumes visual search is often item-by-item. However, the information contained within most visual scenes cannot be divided up into “items” and so the theory is of limited applicability. Such considera- tions led Hulleman and Olivers (2017) to produce an article entitled “The impending demise of the item in visual search”. Fourth, visual search involves parallel processing much more than implied by the theory. For example, Thornton and Gilden (2007) used 29 different visual tasks and found 72% apparently involved parallel Figure 5.11 Performance speed on a detection task as a function of target deﬁnition (conjunctive vs single feature) and display size.

We can explain such findings by assuming that each eye fixa- tion permits considerable parallel processing using information available in peripheral vision (discussed below, see pp. 206–208). Fifth, the theory assumes that the early stages of visual search are entirely feature-based. However, recent research using event-related poten- tials indicates that object-based processing can occur much faster than pre- dicted by feature integration theory (e.g., Berggren & Eimer, 2018). Sixth, the theory assumes visual search is essentially random. This assumption is wrong with respect to the real world – we typically use our knowledge of where a target object is likely to be located when searching for it (see below). Dual-path model In most of the research discussed so far, the target appeared at a random location within the visual display. This is radically different from the real world. Suppose you are outside looking for your missing cat. Your visual search would be very selective – you would ignore the sky and focus mostly on the ground (and perhaps the trees). Thus, your search would involve top-down processes based on your knowledge of where cats are most likely to be found. Ehinger et al. (2009) studied top-down processes in visual search by recording eye fixations of observers searching for a person in 900 real- world outdoor scenes. Observers typically fixated plausible locations (e.g., pavements) and ignored implausible ones (e.g., sky; trees; see Figure 5.12). Observers also fixated locations differing considerably from neighbouring locations and areas containing visual features resembling those of a human figure. How can we reconcile Ehinger et al.’s (2009) findings with those discussed earlier? Wolfe et al. (2011) proposed a dual-path model (see Figure 5.13). There is a selective pathway of limited capacity (indicated by the bottleneck) with objects being selected individually for recognition. Figure 5.12 The first three eye fixations made by observers searching for pedestrians. As can be seen, the great majority of their fixations were on regions in which pedestrians would most likely be found. Observers’ fixations were much more like each other in the left- hand photo than in the right-hand one, because there were fewer likely regions in the left-hand one.

There is also a non-selective pathway in which the “gist” of a scene is processed. Such processing can then guide processing within the selective pathway (represented by the arrow labelled “guidance”). This pathway allows us to utilise our stored environmental knowledge and so is of great value in the real world. Findings Wolfe et al. (2011) compared visual searches for objects presented within a scene setting or at random locations. As predicted, search rate per item was much faster in the scene setting (10 ms vs 40 ms, respectively). Võ and Wolfe (2012) explained that finding in terms of “functional set size” – searching in scenes is efficient because most regions can be ignored. As predicted, Võ and Wolfe found 80% of each scene was rarely fixated. Kaiser and Cichy (2018) presented observers with objects typically located in the upper (e.g., aeroplane; hat) or lower (e.g., carpet; shoe) visual field. These objects were presented in their typical or atypical location (e.g., hat in the lower visual field). Observers had to indicate whether an object presented very briefly was located in the upper or lower visual field. Observers’ performance was better when objects appeared in their typical location because of their extensive knowledge of where objects are gener- ally located. Chukoskie et al. (2013) found observers can easily learn where targets are located. An invisible target was presented at random loca- tions on a blank screen and observers were provided with feedback. There was a strong learning effect – fixations rapidly shifted from being fairly Figure 5.13 A two-pathway model of visual search.

Ehinger et al.’s (2009) findings (discussed earlier, see p. 204) suggested that scene gist or context can be used to enhance the efficiency of visual search. Katti et al. (2017) presented scenes very briefly (83 ms) followed by a mask. Observers were given the task of detecting a person or a car and performed very accurately (over 90%) and rapidly. Katti et al. confirmed that scene gist or context influenced performance. However, performance was influenced more strongly by features of the target object – the more key features of an object were visible, the faster it was detected. What is the take-home message from the above study? The efficiency of visual search with real-world scenes is more complex than implied by Ehinger et al. (2009). More specifically, observers may rapidly fixate on the area close to a target person because they are using scene gist or because they rapidly process features of the person (e.g., wearing clothes). Evaluation Our knowledge of likely (and unlikely) locations for any given object in a scene influences visual search in the real world. This is fully acknowledged in the dual-path model. There is also support for the notion that scene knowledge facilitates visual search by reducing functional set size. What are the model’s limitations? First, how we use gist knowledge of a scene very rapidly to reduce the search area remains unclear. Second, there is insufficient focus on the learning processes that can greatly facil- itate visual search – the effects of such processes can be seen in the very rapid and accurate detection of target information by experts in several domains (see Chapter 11). Third, it is important not to exaggerate the importance of scene gist or context in influencing the efficiency of visual search. Features of the target object can influence visual search more than scene gist (Katti et al., 2017). Fourth, the assumption that items are processed individually within the selective pathway is typically mistaken. As we will see shortly, visual search often depends on parallel processes within peripheral vision and such processes are not considered within the model. Attention vs perception: texture tiling model Several theories (e.g., Treisman & Gelade, 1980) have assumed that indi- vidual items are the crucial units in visual search. Such theories have also often assumed that slow visual search depends mostly on the limitations of focused attention. A plausible implication of these assumptions is that slow visual search depends mostly on foveal vision (the fovea is a small area of maximal visual acuity in the retina). Both the above assumptions have been challenged recently. At the risk of oversimplification, full understanding of visual search requires less emphasis on attention and more on perception. According to Rosenholtz (2016), peripheral (non-foveal) vision is of crucial importance. Acuity decreases as we move away from the fovea to the periphery of vision, but much less than often assumed. You can demonstrate this by holding out KEY TERM Fovea A small area within the retina in the centre in the field of vision where visual acuity is greatest.

Foveal vision only covers the nail so the great majority of what you can see is in peripheral vision. We can also compare the value of foveal and peripheral vision by con- sidering individuals with impaired eyesight. Those with severely impaired peripheral vision (e.g., due to glaucoma) had greater problems with mobil- ity (e.g., number of falls; ability to drive) than those who lack foveal vision (due to macular degeneration) (Rosenholtz, 2016). Individuals with severely impaired central or foveal vision performed almost as well as healthy con- trols at detecting target objects in coloured scenes (75% vs 79%, respec- tively) (Thibaut et al., 2018). If visual search depends heavily on peripheral vision, what predictions can we make? First, if each fixation provides observers with a considerable amount of information about several objects, visual search will typically involve parallel rather than serial processing. Second, we need to consider limitations of peripheral vision (e.g., visual acuity is less in peripheral than foveal vision). However, a more important limitation concerns visual crowding – a reduced ability to recognise objects or other stimuli because of irrelevant neighbouring objects or stimuli (clutter). Visual crowding impairs peripheral vision to a much greater extent than foveal vision. Rosenholtz et al. (2012) proposed the texture tiling model based on the assumption peripheral vision is of crucial importance in visual search. More specifically, processing in peripheral vision can cause adjacent stimuli to tile (join together) to form an apparent target, thus increasing the diffi- culty of visual search. Below we consider findings relevant to this model. Findings As mentioned earlier (p. 203), Thornton and Gilden (2007) found almost three-quarters of the visual tasks they studied involved parallel processing. This is entirely consistent with the emphasis on parallel processing in the model. Direct evidence for the importance of peripheral vision to visual search was reported by Young and Hulleman (2013). They manipulated the visible area around the fixation point making it small, medium or large. As pre- dicted by the model, visual search performance was worst when the visible area was small (so only one item could be processed per fixation). Overall, visual search was almost parallel when the visible area was large but serial when it was small. Chang and Rosenholtz (2016) used various search tasks. According to feature integration theory, both tasks shown in Figure 5.14 should be com- parably hard because the target and distractors share features. In contrast, the texture tiling model predicts the task on the right should be harder because adjacent distractors seen in peripheral vision can more easily tile (join together) to form an apparent T. The findings from these tasks (and several others) supported the texture tiling model but were inconsistent with feature integration theory. Finally, Hulleman and Olivers (2017) produced a model of visual search consistent with the texture tiling model. According to this model, each eye fixation lasts 250 ms, during which information from foveal and peripheral vision is extracted in parallel. They also assumed that the area KEY TERM Visual crowding The inability to recognise objects in peripheral vision due to the presence of neighbouring objects.

A key prediction from Hulleman and Olivers’ (2017) model is that the main reason why search times are longer with more difficult search tasks is because more eye fixations are required than with easier tasks. A computer simulation based on these assumptions produced search times very similar to those obtained in experimental studies. Evaluation What are the strengths of the texture tiling model? First, the information available in peripheral vision is much more important in visual search than assumed previously. The model explains how observers make use of the information available in peripheral vision. Second, the model explains why parallel processing is so prevalent in visual search – it reflects directly parallel processing within peripheral vision. Third, there is accumulating evidence that search times are gener- ally directly related to the number of eye fixations. Fourth, an approach based on eye fixations and peripheral vision can potentially explain findings from all visual search paradigms, including complex visual scenes and item displays. Such an approach thus has more general applicability than feature integration theory. What are the model’s limitations? First, as Chang and Rosenholtz (2016) admitted, it needs further development to account fully for visual search performance. For example, it does not predict search times with precision. In addition, it does not specify the criteria used by observers to decide no target is present. Second, visual search is typically much faster for experts than non- experts in their domain of expertise (e.g., medical experts examining mam- mograms) (see Chapter 11). The texture tiling model does not identify clearly the processes allowing experts to make very efficient use of periph- eral information. CROSS-MODAL EFFECTS Nearly all the research discussed so far is limited in that the visual (or audi- tory) modality was studied on its own. We might try to justify this approach by assuming attentional processes in each sensory modality operate Figure 5.14 The target (T) is easier to find in the display on the left than the one on the right.

However, that assumption is incorrect. In the real world, we often coordinate information from two or more sense modalities at the same time (cross-modal attention). An example is lip reading, where we use visual information about a speaker’s lip move- ments to facilitate our understanding of what they are saying (see Chapter 9). Suppose we present participants with two streams of lights (as was done by Eimer and Schröger, 1998), with one stream being presented to the left and the other to the right. At the same time, we present participants with two streams of sounds (one to each side). In one condition, partici- pants detect deviant visual events (e.g., longer than usual stimuli) presented to one side only. In the other condition, participants detect deviant audi- tory events in only one stream. Event-related potentials were recorded to assess the allocation of atten- tion. Unsurprisingly, Eimer and Schröger (1998) found ERPs to deviant stimuli in the relevant modality were greater to stimuli presented on the to-be-attended side than the to-be-ignored side. Thus, participants allo- cated attention as instructed. Of more interest is what happened to the allocation of attention in the irrelevant modality. Suppose participants detected visual targets on the left side. In that case, ERPs to deviant auditory stimuli were greater on the left side than the right. This is a cross-modal effect: the voluntary or endogenous allocation of visual attention also affected the allocation of auditory attention. Similarly, when participants detected auditory targets on one side, ERPs to deviant visual stimuli on the same side were greater than ERPs to those on the opposite side. Thus, the allocation of auditory attention also influenced the allocation of visual attention. Ventriloquism effect What happens when there is a conflict between simultaneous visual and auditory stimuli? We will focus on the ventriloquism effect in which sounds are misperceived as coming from their apparent visual source. Ventriloquists (at least good ones!) speak without moving their lips while manipulating a dummy’s mouth movements. It seems as if the dummy is speaking. Something similar happens at the movies. The actors’ lips move on the screen but their voices come from loudspeakers beside the screen. Nevertheless, we hear those voices coming from their mouths. Certain conditions must be satisfied for the ventriloquism effect to occur (Recanzone & Sutter, 2008). First, the visual and auditory stimuli must occur close together in time. Second, the sound must match expecta- tions created by the visual stimulus (e.g., high-pitched sound coming from a small object). Third, the sources of the visual and auditory stimuli should be close together spatially. More generally, the ventriloquism effect reflects the unity assumption (the assumption that two or more sensory cues come from the same object: Chen & Spence, 2017). The ventriloquism effect exemplifies visual dominance (visual informa- tion dominating perception). Further evidence comes from the Colavita effect (Colavita, 1974): participants instructed to respond to all stimuli respond more often to visual than simultaneous auditory stimuli (Spence et al., 2011).

(2017) found that misleading visual information about the location of an auditory stimulus influenced the pro- cessing of the auditory stimulus approximately 200 ms after stimulus onset. The finding that this effect is still present even when participants are aware of the spatial discrepancy between the visual and auditory input suggests it occurs relatively “automatically”. However, the ventriloquism effect is smaller when participants had previously heard syllables spoken in a fearful voice (Maiworm et al., 2012). This suggests the effect is not entirely “automatic” but is reduced when the relevance of the auditory channel is increased. Why does vision capture sound in the ventriloquism effect? The visual modality typically provides more precise information about spatial loca- tion. However, when visual stimuli are severely blurred and poorly local- ised, sound captures vision (Alais & Burr, 2004). Thus, we combine visual and auditory information effectively by attaching more weight to the more informative sense modality. Temporal ventriloquism The above explanation for the ventriloquist illusion is a development of the modality appropriateness and precision hypothesis (Welch & Warren, 1980). According to this hypothesis, when conflicting information is pre- sented in two or more modalities, the modality having the greatest acuity generally dominates. This hypothesis predicts the existence of another illu- sion. The auditory modality is typically more precise than the visual modal- ity at discriminating temporal relations. As a result, judgements about the temporal onset of visual stimuli might be biased by auditory stimuli presented very shortly beforehand or afterwards. This is the temporal ventriloquism effect. Research on temporal ventriloquism was reviewed by Chen and Spence (2017). A simple example is when the apparent onset of a flash is shifted towards an abrupt sound presented slightly asynchronously (see Figure 5.15). Other research has found that the apparent duration of visual stimuli can be distorted by asynchronous auditory stimuli. We need to consider the temporal ven- triloquism effect in the context of the unity assumption. This is the assumption that “two or more uni-sensory cues belong together (i.e., that they come from the same object or event)” (Chen & Spence, 2017, p. 1). Chen and Spence discussed findings showing that the unity assumption generally (but not always) enhances the temporal ventriloquism effect. Orchard-Mills et al. (2016) extended research by using two visual stimuli (one KEY TERM Temporal ventriloquism effect Misperception of the timing of a visual stimulus when an auditory stimulus is presented close to it in time.

Thus, it is important to devise effective warning signals to enhance driver attention and reduce collisions. Warning signals might be especially useful if they were informative (i.e., indicating the nature of the danger). However, informative warning signals requiring time-con- suming cognitive processing might be counterproductive. Ho and Spence (2005) considered drivers’ reaction times when braking to avoid a car in front or accelerating to avoid a speeding car behind. An auditory warning signal (car horn) came from the same direction as the critical visual event on 80% or 50% of trials. Braking times were faster when the sound and critical visual event were from the same direction. The greater beneficial effects of auditory signals when predictive rather than non-predictive suggests the involvement of endoge- nous spatial attention (controlled by the individual’s intentions). Auditory stimuli also influenced visual attention even when non-predictive: this probably involved exogenous spatial attention (“automatic” allocation of attention). Gray (2011) studied braking times to avoid a collision with the car in front when drivers heard auditory warning signals increasing in intensity as the time to collision reduced. These signals are known as looming sounds. The most effective condition was the one where the rate of increase in the intensity of the auditory signal was the fastest because it implied the time to collision was the least. Lahmer et al. (2018) found evidence that looming sounds are effective because they are consistent with the visual experience of an approaching collision. Vibrotactile signals produce the perception of vibration through touch. Gray et al. (2014) studied the effects of such signals on speed of braking to avoid a collision. Signals were presented at three sites on the abdomen arranged vertically. In the most effective condition, successive signals moved towards the driver’s head at an increasing rate reflecting the speed they were approaching the car in front. Braking time was 250 ms faster in this condition than a no-warning control condition, probably because it was highly informative. Ahtamad et al. (2016) compared the effectiveness of three vibrotactile warning signals delivered to the back on braking times to avoid a collision with the car in front: (1) expanding (centre of back followed by areas to left and right); (2) contracting (areas to left and right followed by the centre of the back); (3) static (centre of the back + areas to left and right at the same time). The dynamic vibrotactile conditions (1 and 2) produced comparable braking reaction times that were faster than those in the static condition (3). In a second experiment, Ahtamad et al. (2016) compared the expanding vibrotactile condition against a linear motion condition (vibrotactile stimulation to the hands followed by the shoulders). Emergency braking reaction times were faster in the linear motion condition (approximately 585 ms vs 640 ms) because drivers found it easier to interpret the warning signals in that condition. In sum, the various auditory and vibrotactile warning signals discussed above typically reduce braking reaction times by approximately 40 ms. That sounds modest. However, it can easily be the difference between colliding with the car in front or avoiding it and so could potentially save many lives. At present, however, we lack a theoretical framework within which to understand precisely why some warning signals are more effective than others. above and the other below fixation) and two auditory stimuli (low- and high-pitch). When the visual and auditory stimuli were congruent (e.g., visual stimulus above fixation and auditory stimulus high-pitch), the tem- poral ventriloquism effect was found. However, this effect was eliminated when the visual and auditory stimuli were incongruent, which prevented binding of information across the two senses.

First, as just mentioned, our theoretical understanding lags behind the accumulation of empirical findings. Second, much research has involved complex artificial tasks far removed from naturalistic conditions. Third, individual differ- ences have generally been ignored. However, individual differences (e.g., preference for auditory or visual stimuli) influence cross-modal effects (van Atteveldt et al., 2014). DIVIDED ATTENTION: DUAL-TASK PERFORMANCE In this section, we consider factors influencing how well we can perform two tasks at the same time. In our hectic 24/7 lives, we increasingly try to do two things at once (multi-tasking) (e.g., sending text messages while walking down the street). More specifically, multi-tasking “refers to the ability to co-ordinate the completion of several tasks to achieve an overall goal” (MacPherson, 2018, p. 314). It can involve performing two tasks at the same time or switching between two tasks. There is controversy as to whether massive amounts of multi-tasking have beneficial or detrimental effects on attention and cognitive control (see Box). What determines how well we can perform two tasks at once? Similarity (e.g., in terms of modality) is one important factor. Treisman and Davies (1973) found two monitoring tasks interfered with each other much more when the stimuli on both tasks were in the same modality (visual or auditory). Two tasks can also be similar in response modality. McLeod (1977) had participants perform a continuous tracking task with manual respond- ing together with a tone-identification task. Some participants responded vocally to the tones whereas others responded with the hand not involved in tracking. Tracking performance was worse with high response similarity (manual responses on both tasks) than with low response similarity. Practice is the most important factor determining how well two tasks can be performed together. The saying “Practice makes perfect” was apparently supported by Spelke et al. (1976). Two students (Diane and John) received 5 hours of training a week for 4 months on various tasks. Their first task involved reading short stories for comprehension while writing down words from dictation, which they initially found very hard. After 6 weeks of training, however, they could read as rapidly and with as much comprehension when writing to dictation as when only reading. With further training, Diane and John learned to write down the names of the categories to which the dictated words belonged while maintaining normal reading speed and comprehension. Spelke et al.’s (1976) findings are hard to interpret for various reasons. First, Spelke et al. focused on accuracy measures, which are typically less sensitive to dual-task interference than speed measures. Second, Diane and John’s attentional focus was relatively uncontrolled, and so they may have alternated attention between tasks rather than attending to both at the same time. More controlled research on the effects of practice on dual-task performance is discussed later.

Serial processing involves switching attention backwards and forwards between two tasks with only one task being processed at any given moment. In contrast, parallel processing involves processing both tasks at the same time. There has been much theoretical controversy on the issue of serial vs parallel processing in dual-task conditions (Koch et al., 2018). Of impor- tance, processing can be mostly parallel or mostly serial. Lehle et al. (2009) trained participants to use serial or parallel processing when perform- ing two tasks together. Those using serial processing performed better. However, they found the tasks more effortful because they had to inhibit processing of one task while performing the other one. Lehle and Hübner (2009) also instructed participants to perform two tasks together in a serial or parallel fashion. Those using parallel processing IN THE REAL WORLD: MULTI-TASKING What are the effects of frequent multi-tasking in our everyday lives? Two main answers have been proposed. First, heavy multi-tasking may impair cognitive control because it leads individuals to allocate their attentional resources too widely. This is the scattered attention hypothesis (van der Schuur et al., 2015). Second, heavy multi-tasking may enhance some control processes (e.g., task switching) because of prolonged practice in processing multiple streams of information. This is the trained attention hypothesis (van der Schuur et al., 2015). The relevant evidence is very inconsistent – “positive, negative, and null effects have all been reported” (Uncapher & Wagner, 2018, p. 9894). Ophir et al. (2009) used a questionnaire (the Media Multitasking Index) to identify levels of multi-tasking. Heavy multi-taskers were more distractible. In a review, van der Schuur et al. (2015) found findings supported the scattered attention hypothesis (e.g., heavy multi-taskers had impaired sustained attention). Moisala et al. (2016) found heavy multi-taskers were more adversely affected than light multi-taskers by distracting stimuli while performing speech–listening and reading tasks. During distraction, the heavy multi-taskers had greater activity than the light multi-taskers in the right pre- frontal cortex (associated with attentional control). This suggests heavy multi-taskers have greater problems than previously believed – their performance is impaired even though they try harder to exert top-down attentional control. Uncapher and Wagner (2018) found in a review that most research indicated negative effects of heavy multi-tasking on tasks involving working memory, long-term memory, sustained atten- tion and relational reasoning. These negative effects are likely to be due to attentional lapses. Of relevance, there are several studies where media multi-tasking was positively associated with self-reported everyday attentional failures. In addition, heavy multi-taskers often report high impul- sivity – such individuals often make rapid decisions based on very limited evidence. Most studies have only found an association between media multi-tasking and measures of attention and performance. This makes it hard to establish causality – it is possible individuals with certain patterns of attention choose to engage in extensive multi-tasking. Evidence suggesting that media multi-tasking can cause attention problems was reported by Baumgartner et al. (2018). They found that high media multi-tasking at one point in time predicted attention problems several months later.

Fischer and Plessow (2015) reviewed dual-task research and concluded: “While serial task processing appears to be the most efficient [dual-task] processing strategy, participants are able to adopt parallel processing. Moreover, parallel processing can even outperform serial processing under certain conditions” (p. 8). Brüning and Manzey (2018) confirmed serial processing is not always more efficient than parallel processing. Participants performed many alter- nate trials on two different tasks but could see the stimulus for the next trial ahead of time. Participants engaging in parallel processing (process- ing the stimulus for trial n+1 during trial n) performed better than those using only serial processing (not processing the trial n+1 stimulus ahead of time). Parallel processing reduced the costs incurred when task switching. Individuals high in working memory capacity (see Glossary) were more likely to use parallel processing, perhaps because of their superior atten- tional control. IN THE REAL WORLD: CAN WE THINK AND DRIVE? Car driving is the riskiest activity engaged in by tens of millions of adults. Over 50 countries have laws restricting the use of mobile or cell phones by drivers to increase car safety. Are such restric- tions necessary? The short answer is “Yes” – drivers using a mobile phone are several times more likely to be involved in a car accident (Nurullah, 2015). This is so even though drivers try to reduce the risks by driving slightly more slowly (reducing speed by 5–6 mph) than usual shortly after initi- ating a mobile-phone call (Farmer et al., 2015). Caird et al. (2008) in a review of studies using simulated driving tasks reported that reaction times to events (e.g., onset of brake lights on the car in front) increased by 250 ms with mobile- phone use and were greater when drivers were talking rather than listening. This 250 ms increase in reaction time translates into travelling an extra 18 feet (5.5 metres) before stopping for a motor- ist doing 50 mph (80 kph). This could be the difference between stopping just short of a child or killing that child. Strayer and Drews (2007) studied the above slowing effect using event-related potentials while drivers responded rapidly to the onset of brake lights on the car in front. The magnitude of the P300 (a positive wave associated with attention) was reduced by 50% in mobile-phone users. Strayer et al. (2011) considered a real-life driving situation. Drivers were observed to see whether they obeyed a law requiring them to stop at a road junction. Of drivers not using a mobile phone, 79% obeyed the law compared to only 25% of mobile-phone users. Theoretical considerations Why do so many drivers endanger people’s lives by using mobile phones? Most believe they can drive safely while using a mobile phone whereas other drivers cannot (Sanbonmatsu et al., 2016b). Their misplaced confidence depends on limited monitoring of their driving performance: drivers using a mobile phone make more driving errors but do not remember making more errors (Sanbonmatsu et al., 2016a). Why does mobile-phone use impair driving performance? Strayer and Fisher (2016) in their SPIDER model identified five cognitive processes that are adversely affected when drivers’ attention is diverted from driving (e.g., by mobile-phone use): Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43.","evidence":["asking at one point in time predicted attention problems several months later.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43."]}

Distracted drivers are more inclined to focus attention on the centre of the road and less inclined to scan objects in the periphery and their side mirrors (Strayer & Fisher, 2016). (2) The ability to predict where threats might occur is impaired. Distracted drivers are much less likely to make anticipatory glances towards the location of a potential hazard (e.g., obstructed view of a pedestrian crossing) (Taylor et al., 2015). (3) There is reduced ability to identify visible threats, a phenomenon known as inattentional blind- ness (see Glossary; and Chapter 4). In a study by Strayer and Drews (2007), 30 objects (e.g., pedestrians; advertising hoardings) were clearly visible to drivers. However, those using a mobile phone subsequently recognised far fewer objects they had fixated than those not using a mobile phone (under 25% vs 50%, respectively). (4) It is harder to decide what action is necessary in a threatening situation. Cooper et al. (2009) found drivers were 11% more likely to make unsafe lane changes when using a mobile phone. (5) It becomes harder to execute the appropriate action. Reaction times are slowed (Caird et al., 2008, discussed above, p. 214). The SPIDER model is oversimplified in several ways. First, various different activities are associated with mobile-phone use. Simmons et al. (2016) found in a meta-analytic review that the risk of safety- critical events was increased by activities requiring drivers to take their eyes off the road (e.g., locat- ing a phone; dialling; texting). However, talking on a mobile phone did not increase risk. Second, driving-irrelevant cognitive activities do not always impair all aspects of driving per- formance. Engstrom et al. (2017, p. 734) proposed their cognitive control hypothesis: “Cognitive load selectively impairs driving sub-tasks that rely on cognitive control but leaves automatic perfor- mance unaffected.” For example, driving-irrelevant activities involving cognitive load (e.g., mobile- phone use) typically have no adverse effect on well-practised driving skills, such as lane keeping and braking when getting close to the vehicle in front (Engstrom et al., 2017). Third, individuals using mobile phones while driving are unrepresentative of drivers in general (e.g., they tend to be relatively young and to engage in more risk-taking activities: Precht et al., 2017). Thus, we must consider individual differences in personality and risk taking when interpret- ing accidents associated with mobile-phone use. Fourth, the SPIDER model implies that performance cannot be improved by adding a secondary task. However, driving performance in monotonous conditions is sometimes better when drivers listen to the radio at the same time (see Engstrom et al., 2017). Listening to the radio can reduce the mind-wandering that occurs when someone drives in monotonous conditions. Drivers indicat- ing their immediate thoughts during their daily commute reported mind-wandering 63% of the time and active focus on driving only 15%–20% of the time (Burdett et al., 2018). Multiple resource theory Wickens (1984, 2008) argued in his multiple resource model that the pro- cessing system consists of several independent processing resources or mechanisms. The model includes four major dimensions (see Figure 5.16): (1) Processing stages: there are successive stages of perception, cognition (e.g., working memory) and responding. (2) Processing codes: perception, cognition and responding can use spatial and/or verbal codes; action can involve speech (vocal verbal) or manual/spatial responses.

(4) Visual channels: visual processing can be focal (high acuity) or ambient (peripheral). Here is the model’s crucial prediction: “To the extent that two tasks use dif- ferent levels along each of the three dimensions [excluding (4) above], time- sharing [dual-task performance] will be better” (Wickens, 2008, p. 450). Thus, tasks requiring different resources can be performed together more success- fully than those requiring the same resources. Wickens’s approach bears some resemblance to Baddeley’s (e.g., 2012) working memory model (see Chapter 6). According to that model, two tasks can be performed together successfully provided they use different components or processing resources. Findings Research discussed earlier (Treisman & Davies, 1973; McLeod, 1977) showing the negative effects of stimulus and response similarity on per- formance are entirely consistent with the theory. Lu et al. (2013) reviewed research where an ongoing visual-motor task (e.g., car driving) was performed together with an interrupting task in the visual, auditory or tactile (touch) modality. As predicted, non-visual interrupting tasks (espe- cially those in the tactile modality) were processed more effectively than visual ones and there were no adverse effects on the visual-motor task. According to the model, there should be only limited dual-task inter- ference between two visual tasks if one requires focal or foveal vision, whereas the other requires ambient or peripheral vision. Tsang and Chan (2018) obtained support for this prediction in a study in which participants tracked a moving target in focal vision while responding to a spatial task in ambient or peripheral vision. Dual-task performance is often more impaired than predicted by the theory. For example, consider a study by Robbins et al. (1996; see Figure 5.16 Wickens’s four-dimensional multiple resource model.

The main task was selecting chess moves and we will focus on the condition where the task performed at the same time was generating random letters. These two tasks involve different processing codes (spatial vs verbal, respectively) and they also involve different response types (manual vs vocal, respectively). Nevertheless, generating random letters caused substantial interference on the chess task. Evaluation The main assumptions of the theory have largely been supported by the experimental evidence. In other words, dual-task performance is generally less impaired when two tasks differ with respect to modalities, processing codes or visual channels than when they do not. What are the model’s limitations? (1) Successful dual-task performance often requires higher-level processes of coordinating and organising the demands of the two tasks (see later section on cognitive neuroscience, pp. 220–222). However, these processes are de-emphasised within the theory. (2) The theory’s assumption there is a sequence of processing stages (per- ception; cognition; responding) is too rigid given the flexible nature of much dual-task processing (Koch et al., 2018). The numerous forms of cognitive processing intervening between perception and respond- ing are not discussed in detail. (3) It is implied within the theory that negative or interfering effects of performing two tasks together would be constantly present. However, Steinborn and Huestegge (2017) found dual-task conditions led only to occasional performance breakdown due to attention failures. Threaded cognition Salvucci and Taatgen (2008, 2011) proposed a model of threaded cogni- tion in which streams of thought are represented as threads of processing. For example, processing two tasks might involve two separate threads. The central theoretical assumptions are as follows: Multiple threads or goals can be active at the same time, and as long as there is no overlap in the cognitive resources needed by these threads, there is no multi-tasking interference. When threads require the same resource at the same time, one thread must wait and its performance will be adversely affected. (Salvucci & Taatgen, 2011, p. 228) This is because all resources have limited capacity. Taatgen (2011) discussed the threaded cognition model (see Figure 5.17). Several cognitive resources can be the source of competition between two tasks. These include visual perception, declarative memory, task control and focal working memory or problem state. Nijboer et al. (2016a) discussed similarities between this model and Baddeley’s working memory model (see Chapter 6).

Each thread or task controls resources in a greedy, polite way – threads claim resources greedily when required but release them politely when no longer needed. These aspects of the model lead to one of its most original assumptions – several goals (each associated with a given thread) can be active simultaneously. The model resembles Wickens’s multiple resource model: both models assume there are several independent processing resources. However, only the threaded cognition model led to a computational model making spe- cific predictions. In addition, the threaded cognition model identifies the brain areas associated with each processing resource (see Figure 5.17). Findings According to the model, any given cogni- tive resource (e.g., visual perception; focal working memory) can be used by only one process at any given time. Nijboer et al. (2013) tested this assumption using multi-column subtraction as the primary task with participants responding using a keypad. Easy and hard conditions dif- fered in whether digits were carried over (“borrowed”) from one column to the next: (1: easy) (2: hard) 336789495 3649772514 –224578381 –1852983463 The model predicts focal working memory is required only in the hard con- dition. Subtraction was combined with a secondary task: a tracking task involving visual and manual resources or a tone-counting task involving working memory. Nijboer et al. (2013) predicted performance on the easy subtraction task should be worse when combined with the tracking task because both compete for visual and manual resources. In contrast, performance on the hard subtraction task should be worse when combined with the tone- counting task because there are large disruptive effects when two tasks compete for working memory resources. The findings were as predicted. Borst et al. (2013) found there was far less impairment of hard sub- traction performance by a secondary task requiring working memory when Figure 5.17 Threaded cognition theory. We possess several cognitive resources (e.g., declarative memory, task control, visual perception). These resources can be used in parallel but each resource can only work on one task at a time. Our ability to perform two tasks at the same time (e.g., driving and dialling, subtraction and typing) depends on the precise ways in which cognitive resources need to be used. The theory also identifies some of the brain areas associated with cognitive resources. From Taatgen (2011). With permission of the author.

This supports the model’s assumption that dual-task performance can be enhanced by appropriate environmental support. According to the threaded cognition model, we often cope with the demands of combining two tasks by switching flexibly between them to maximise performance. Support was reported by Farmer et al. (2018). Participants performed a typing task and a tracking task at the same time. The relative value of the two tasks was varied by manipulating the number of points lost for poor tracking performance. Participants rapidly learned to adjust their strategies over time to increase the overall number of points they gained. Katidioti and Taatgen (2014) found task switching is not always optimal. Participants performed two tasks together: (1) an email task in which information needed to be looked up; (2) chat messages containing questions to be answered. When there was a delay on the email task, most participants switched to the chat task. This happened even when this was suboptimal because it caused participants to forget information in the email task. How can we explain the above findings? According to Katidioti and Taatgen (2014, p. 734), “The results . . . agree with threaded cognition’s ‘greedy’ theory . . . which states that people will switch to a task that is waiting as soon as the resources for it are available.” Huijser et al. (2018) obtained further evidence of “greediness”. When there were brief blank periods during the performance of a cognitively demanding task, partic- ipants often had task-irrelevant thoughts (e.g., mind-wandering) even though these thoughts impaired task performance. Katidioti and Taatgen (2014) also discovered substantial individual differences in task switching – some participants never switched to the chat task when delays occurred on the email task. Such individual differences cannot be explained by the theory. As mentioned earlier, a recent version of threaded cognition theory discussed by Nijboer et al. (2016a) identifies three components of working (i.e., problem state or focus of attention; declarative memory or activated short-term memory; and subvocal rehearsal). Nijboer et al. had partici- pants perform two working memory tasks at the same time; these tasks varied in the extent to which they required the same working memory com- ponents. They obtained measures of performance and also used neuroim- aging under dual-task and single-task conditions. What did Nijboer et al. (2016a) find? First, dual-task interference could be predicted from the extent to which the two tasks involved the same working memory components. Second, dual-task interference could also be predicted from the extent of overlap in brain activation of the two tasks in single-task conditions. In sum, dual-task interference depended on competition for specific resources (i.e., working memory components) rather than general resources (e.g., central executive).

This has led to compu- tational modelling testing the model’s predictions using neuroimaging and behavioural findings. Thus, the model accounts for dual-task performance without assuming the existence of a central executive or other executive process (often vaguely defined in other theories). Fourth, the theory predicts factors determining switching between two tasks being performed together. Fifth, individuals often have fewer problems performing two simultaneous tasks than generally assumed. What are the model’s limitations? First, it predicts that “Practising two tasks concurrently [together] results in the same performance as perform- ing the two tasks independently” (Salvucci & Taatgen, 2008, p. 127). This de-emphasises the importance of processes coordinating and managing two tasks performed together (see next section). Second, excluding processes resembling Baddeley’s central executive is controversial and may well prove inadvisable. Third, most tests of the model have involved the simul- taneous performance of two relatively simple tasks and its applicability to more complex tasks remains unclear. Fourth, the theory does not provide a full explanation for individual differences in the extent of task switching (e.g., Katidioti & Taatgen, 2014). Cognitive neuroscience The cognitive neuroscience approach is increasingly used to test theoretical models and enhance our understanding of processes underlying dual-task performance. Its value is that neuroimaging provides “an additional data source for contrasting between alternative models” (Palmeri et al., 2017, p. 61). More generally, behavioural findings indicate the extent to which dual-task conditions impair task performance but are often relatively unin- formative about the precise reasons for such impairment. Suppose we compare patterns of brain activation while participants perform tasks x and y singly or together. Three basic patterns are shown in Figure 5.18: (1) Underadditive activation: reduced activation in one or more brain areas in the dual-task condition occurs because of resource competi- tion between the tasks.

(3) Overadditive activation: brain activation in one or more brain areas is present in the dual-task condition but not the single-task conditions. This occurs when dual-task conditions require executive processes that are absent (or less important) with single tasks. These executive pro- cesses include the coordination of task demands, attentional control and dual-task management generally. We would expect such executive processes to be associated mostly with activation in prefrontal cortex. Findings We start with an example of underadditive activation. Just et al. (2001) used two very different tasks (auditory sentence comprehension and mental rotation of 3-D figures) performed together or singly. Performance on both tasks was impaired under dual-task conditions compared to single-task conditions. Under dual-task conditions, brain activation in language pro- cessing areas decreased by 53% and reduced by 29% in areas associated with mental rotation. These findings suggest fewer task-relevant processing resources were available when both tasks were performed together. Schweizer et al. (2013) also reported underadditivity. Participants performed a driving task on its own or with a distracting secondary task (answering spoken questions). Driving performance was unaffected by the secondary task. However, driving with distraction reduced activa- tion in posterior brain areas associated with spatial and visual processing (underadditivity). It also produced increased activation in the prefrontal cortex (overadditivity; see Figure 5.19) probably because driving with dis- traction requires increased attentional or cognitive control within the pre- frontal cortex. Dual-task performance is often associated with overadditivity due to increased activity within the prefrontal cortex (especially the lateral pre- frontal cortex) during dual-task performance (see Strobach et al., 2018, for a review). However, most such findings do not show that this increased prefrontal activation is actually required for dual-task performance. More direct evidence that prefrontal areas associated with attentional or cognitive control are causally involved in enhancing dual-task perfor- mance was reported by Filmer et al. (2017) and Strobach et al. (2018). Filmer et al. (2017) studied the effects of transcranial direct current stim- ulation (tDCS; see Glossary) applied to areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. Anodal tDCS during training enhanced cognitive control and subsequent dual-task performance.

There were significant increases in activation within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the auditory cortex (in orange). There was decreased activation in occipital-visual areas (in blue).

Anodal tDCS applied to the lateral prefrontal cortex led to enhanced dual-task performance. In another condition, cathodal tDCS to the same area of the prefrontal cortex impaired dual-task performance. These findings were as predicted given that anodal and cathodal tDCS often have opposite effects on per- formance. These findings indicate that the lateral prefrontal cortex causally influences dual-task performance. Additional evidence of the importance of the lateral prefrontal cortex was reported by Wen et al. (2018). Individuals with high connectivity (con- nectedness) within that brain area showed superior dual-task performance to those with low connectivity. Finally, patterns of brain activation can help to explain practice effects on dual-task performance. Garner and Dux (2015) found much fronto- parietal activation (associated with cognitive control) when two tasks were performed singly or together. Extensive training greatly reduced dual-task interference and also produced increasing differentiation in the pattern of fronto-parietal activation associated with the two tasks. Participants showing the greatest reduction in dual-task interference tended to have the greatest increase in differentiation. Thus, using practice to increase differences in pro- cessing and associated brain processing between tasks can be very effective. Evaluation Brain activity in dual-task conditions often differs from the sum of brain activity of the same two tasks performed singly. Dual-task activity can exhibit underadditivity or overadditivity. The findings are theoretically important because they indicate performance of dual tasks can involve much more cognitive control and other processes than single tasks. Garner and Dux’s (2015) findings demonstrate that enhanced dual-task perfor- mance with practice can depend on increased differentiation between the two tasks with respect to processing and brain activation. What are the limitations of the cognitive neuroscience approach? First, increased (or decreased) activity in a given brain area in dual-task conditions is not necessarily very informative. For example, Dux et al. (2009) found dual-task performance improved over time because prac- tice increased the speed of information processing in the prefrontal cortex rather than because it changed activation within that region. Second, it is often unclear whether patterns of brain activation are directly relevant to task processing rather than reflecting non-task processing. Third, findings in this area are rather inconsistent (Strobach et al., 2018) and we lack a comprehensive theory to account for these inconsistencies. Plausible reasons for these apparent inconsistencies are the great variety of task combinations used in dual-task studies and individual differences in task proficiency among participants (Watanabe & Funahashi, 2018). Psychological refractory period: cognitive bottleneck? Much of the research discussed so far was limited because the task combi- nations used made it hard to assess in detail the processes used by partic- ipants.

This led researchers to use much simpler tasks so that they had “better experimental control over the timing of the component task processes” (Koch et al., 2018, p. 575). The dominant paradigm in recent research is as follows. There are two stimuli (e.g., two lights) and two responses (e.g., button presses), one asso- ciated with each stimulus. Participants respond to each stimulus as rapidly as possible. When the two stimuli are presented at the same time (dual-task condition), performance is typically worse on both tasks than when each task is presented separately (single-task conditions). When the second stimulus is presented shortly after the first, there is typically a marked slowing of the response to the second stimulus: the psychological refractory period (PRP) effect. This effect is robust – Ruthruff et al. (2009) obtained a large PRP effect even when participants were given strong incentives to eliminate it. The PRP effect has direct real-world relevance. Hibberd et al. (2013) studied the effects of a simple in-vehicle task on braking performance when the vehicle in front braked and slowed down. There was a classic PRP effect – braking time was slowest when the in-vehicle task was presented immediately before the vehicle in front braked. How can we explain the PRP effect? It is often argued task perfor- mance involves three successive stages: (1) perceptual; (2) central response selection; and (3) response execution. According to the bottleneck model (e.g., Pashler, 1994), The response selection stage of the second task cannot begin until the response selection stage of the first task has finished, although the other stages . . . can proceed in parallel . . . according to this model, the PRP effect is a consequence of the waiting time of the second task because of a bottleneck at the response selection stage. (Mittelstädt & Miller, 2017, p. 89) The bottleneck model explains several findings. For example, consider the effects of varying the time between the start of the first and second stimuli (stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA)). According to the model, processing on the first task should slow down second-task processing much more when the SOA is small than when it is larger. The predicted finding is generally obtained (Mittelstädt & Miller, 2017). The bottleneck model remains the most influential explanation of the PRP effect (and other dual-task costs). However, resource models (e.g., Navon & Miller, 2002) are also influential. According to these models, limited processing capacity can be shared between two tasks so both are processed simultaneously. Of crucial importance, sharing is possible even during the response selection process. A consequence of sharing processing capacity across task is that each task is processed more slowly than if per- formed on its own. Many findings can be explained by both models. However, resource models are more flexible than bottleneck models. Why is this? Resource models assume the division of processing resources between two tasks varies freely to promote efficient performance.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43.\n\n224 Visual perception and attention Another factor influencing the PRP effect is crosstalk (the two tasks interfere directly with each other). This mostly occurs when the stimuli and/or responses on the two tasks are similar. A classic example of cross- talk is when you try to rub your stomach in circles with one hand while patting your head with the other hand (try it!). Finally, note that participants in most studies receive only modest amounts of practice in performing two tasks at the same time. As a con- sequence, the PRP effect may occur at least in part because participants receive insufficient practice to eliminate it. Findings According to the bottleneck model, we would expect to find a PRP effect even when easy tasks are used and/or participants receive prolonged prac- tice. Contrary evidence was reported by Schumacher et al. (2001). They used two tasks: (1) say “one”, “two” or “three” to low-, medium- and high-pitched tones, respectively; (2) press response keys corresponding to the position of a disc on a computer screen. These tasks were performed together for over 2,000 trials, by which time some participants performed them as well together as singly. Strobach et al. (2013) conducted a study very similar to that of Schumacher et al. (2001). Participants took part in over 5,000 trials involv- ing single-task or dual-task conditions. However, dual-task costs were not eliminated after extensive practice: dual-task costs on the auditory task reduced from 185 to 60 ms and those on the visual task from 83 to 20 ms (see Figure 5.20). How did dual-task practice benefit performance? Practice speeded up the central response selection stage in both tasks. Why did the findings differ in the two studies discussed above? In both studies, participants were rewarded for fast responding on single-task and dual-task trials. However, the way the reward system was set up in the Schumacher et al. study may have led participants to exert more effort in dual-task than single-task trials. This potential bias was absent from the KEY TERM Crosstalk In dual-task conditions, the direct interference between the tasks that is sometimes found.

This difference in reward structure could explain the greater dual-task costs in the Strobach et al. study. Hesselmann et al. (2011) studied the PRP effect using event-related potentials. The slowing of responses on the second task was closely matched by slowing in the onset of the P300 (an ERP component reflecting response selection). However, there was no slowing of earlier ERP compo- nents reflecting perceptual processing. Thus, as predicted by the bottleneck model, the PRP effect depended on response selection rather than percep- tual processes. According to the resource model approach, individuals choose whether to use serial or parallel processing on PRP tasks. Miller et al. (2009) argued that serial processing generally leads to superior performance compared with parallel processing. However, parallel processing should theoretically be superior when the stimuli associated with the two tasks are mostly pre- sented close in time. As predicted, there was a shift from predominantly serial processing towards parallel processing when that was the case. Miller et al. (2009) used very simple tasks and it is likely parallel pro- cessing is most likely to be used with such tasks. Han and Marois (2013) used two tasks, one of which was relatively difficult. Participants used serial processing even when parallel processing was encouraged by finan- cial rewards. Finally, we consider the theoretically important backward crosstalk effect: “characteristics of Task 2 of 2 subsequently performed tasks influ- ence Task 1 performance” (Janczyk et al., 2018, p. 261). Hommel (1998) obtained this effect. Participants responded to Task 1 by making a left or right key-press and to Task 2 by saying “left” or “right”. Task 1 responses were faster when the two responses were compatible (e.g., press right key + say “right”) than when they were incompatible (e.g., press right key + say “left”). Evidence for the backward crosstalk effect was also reported by Janczyk et al. (2018). Why is the backward crosstalk effect theoretically important? It indi- cates that aspects of response selection processing on Task 2 occur before response selection processing on Task 1 has finished. This effect is incom- patible with the bottleneck model, which assumes response selection on Task 1 is completed prior to any response selection on Task 2. In other words, this model assumes there is serial processing at the response selec- tion stage. In contrast, the backward crosstalk effect is compatible with the resource model approach. Summary and conclusions The findings from most research on the psychological refractory period effect are consistent with the bottleneck model. As predicted, this effect is typically larger when the second task follows very soon after the first task. In addition, even prolonged practice rarely eliminates the psychological refractory period effect suggesting that central response selection processes typically occur serially. The bottleneck model assumes processing is less flexible than is often the case. For example, the existence of the backward crosstalk effect is inconsistent with the bottleneck model but consistent with the resource KEY TERM Backward crosstalk effect Aspects of Task 2 influence response selection and performance speed on Task 1 in studies on the psychological refractory period (PRP) effect.

There was less interference between the two tasks when finan- cial rewards were offered because participants devoted more processing resources to protecting the first task from interference. However, the resource model approach has the disadvantage compared to the bottleneck model that its predictions are less precise, making it harder to submit to detailed empirical testing. Finally, as Koch et al. (2017, p. 575) pointed out, the bottleneck model “can be applied (with huge success) mainly for conditions in which two tasks are performed strictly sequentially”. This is often the case with research on the psychological refractory period effect but is much less applicable to more complex dual-task situations. “AUTOMATIC” PROCESSING We have seen in studies of divided attention that practice often causes a dra- matic improvement in performance. This improvement has been explained by assuming some processes become automatic through prolonged prac- tice. For example, the huge amount of practice we have had with reading words has led to the assumption that familiar words are read “automati- cally”. Below we consider various definitions of “automaticity”. We also consider different approaches to explaining the development of automatic processing. Traditional approach: Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) and Schneider and Shiffrin (1977) distin- guished between controlled and automatic processes: ● Controlled processes are of limited capacity, require attention and can be used flexibly in changing circumstances. ● Automatic processes suffer no capacity limitations, do not require attention and are very hard to modify once learned. In Schneider and Shiffrin’s (1977) research, participants memorised letters (the memory set) followed by a visual display containing letters. They then decided rapidly whether any item in the visual display was the same as any item in the memory set. The crucial manipulation was the type of mapping. With consistent mapping, only consonants were used as members of the memory set and only numbers were used as distractors in the visual display (or vice versa). Thus, a participant given only consonants to mem- orise would know any consonant detected in the visual display was in the memory set. With varied mapping, numbers and consonants were both used to form the memory set and to provide distractors in the visual display. The mapping manipulation had dramatic effects (see Figure 5.21). The numbers of items in the memory set and visual display greatly affected decision speed only with varied mapping. According to Schneider and Shiffrin (1977), varied mapping involved serial comparisons between each item in the memory set and each item in the visual display until a match was achieved or every comparison had been made.

In contrast, consistent Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43.\n\nAttention and performance 227 mapping involved automatic processes operating independently and in par- allel. These automatic processes have evolved through prolonged practice in distinguishing between letters and numbers. In a second experiment, Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) used consistent mapping with the consonants B to L forming one set and Q to Z the other set. As before, items from only one set always formed the memory set with all the distractors in the visual display being selected from the other set. Performance improved greatly over 2,100 trials, reflecting increased automaticity. After that, there were 2,100 trials with the reverse consist- ent mapping (swapping over the memory and visual display sets). With this reversal, it took nearly 1,000 trials before performance recovered to its level at the start of the experiment! Evidence that there may be limited (or no conscious awareness in the consistent mapping condition was reported by Jansma et al. (2001)). Increasing automaticity (indexed by increased performance speed) was accompanied by reduced activation in areas associated with conscious awareness (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). In sum, automatic processes function rapidly and in parallel but are inflexible (second part of the second experiment). Controlled processes are flexible and versatile but operate relatively slowly and in a serial fashion. Limitations What are the limitations with this approach? First, the distinction between automatic and controlled processes is oversimplified (discussed below). Second, Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) argued automatic processes operate in parallel and place no demands on attentional capacity and so decision speed should be unrelated to the number of items. However, decision Figure 5.21 Response times on a decision task as a function of memory-set size, display- set size and consistent vs varied mapping.

Third, the theory is descriptive rather than explanatory – it does not explain how serial controlled processing turns into parallel automatic processing. Definitions of automaticity Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) assumed there is a clear-cut distinction between automatic and controlled processes. More specifically, automatic processes possess several features (e.g., inflexibility; very efficient because they have no capacity limitations; occurring in the absence of attention). In essence, it is assumed there is perfect coherence or consistency among the features (i.e., they are all found together). Moors and De Houwer (2006) and Moors (2016) identified four key features associated with automaticity: (1) unconscious: lack of conscious awareness of at least one of the fol- lowing: “the input, the output, and the transition from one to the other” (Moors, 2016, p. 265); (2) efficient: using very little attentional capacity; (3) fast; (4) goal-unrelated or goal-uncontrolled: at least one of the following is missing: “the goal is absent, the desired state does not occur, or the causal relation [between the goal and the occurrence of the desired state] is absent” (Moors, 2016, p. 265). Why might these four features (or the similar ones identified by Shiffrin and Schneider (1977)) often be found together? Instance theory (Logan, 1988; Logan et al., 1999) provides an influential answer. It is assumed task practice leads to storage of information in long-term memory which facilitates subsequent performance on that task. In essence, “Automaticity is memory retrieval: performance is automatic when it is based on a single-step direct-access retrieval of past solutions from memory” (Logan, 1988, p. 493). For example, if you were given the problem “24 × 7 = ???” numerous times, you would retrieve the answer (168) “automatically” without performing any mathematical calculations. Instance theory makes coherent sense of several characteristics of automaticity. Automatic processes are fast because they require only the retrieval of past solutions from long-term memory. They make few demands on attentional resources because the retrieval of heavily over-learned information is relatively effortless. Finally, there is no conscious awareness of automatic processes because no significant processes intervene between stimulus presentation and retrieval of the correct response. In spite of its strengths, instance theory is limited (see Moors, 2016). First, the theory implies the key features of automaticity will typically all be found together. However, this is not the case (see below). Second, it is assumed practice leads to automatic retrieval of solutions with learners having no control over such retrieval. However, Wilkins and Rawson (2011) found evidence learners can exercise top-down control over retrieval: when the instructions emphasised accuracy, there was less evidence of retrieval Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43.","evidence":[".","Data from Shiffrin and Schneider (1977)."]}

Thus, the use of retrieval after practice is not fully automatic. Melnikoff and Bargh (2018) argued that the central problem with the traditional approach is that no research has shown the four features asso- ciated with “automaticity” occurring together. As they pointed out, “No attempt has been made to estimate the probability of a process being inten- tional given that is conscious versus unconscious, or the probability of a process being controllable given that it is efficient versus inefficient, and so forth” (p. 282). Decompositional approach: Moors (2016) Moors and De Houwer (2006) and Moors (2016) argued that previous theoretical approaches are greatly oversimplified. Instead, they favoured a decompositional approach. According to this approach, the features of automaticity are clearly separable and are by no means always found together: “It is dangerous to draw inferences about the presence or absence of one feature on the basis of the presence or absence of another” (Moors & de Houwer, 2006, p. 320). Moors and De Houwer (2006) also argued there is no firm dividing line between automaticity and non-automaticity. The features are continuous rather than all-or-none (e.g., a process can be fairly fast or slow; it can be partially conscious). As a result, most processes involve a blend of automa- ticity and non-automaticity. This approach is rather imprecise because few processes are 100% automatic or non-automatic. However, we can make relative statements (e.g., process X is more/less automatic than process Y). Moors (2016) claimed the relationships between factors such as goals, attention and consciousness are much more complex than claimed within traditional approaches to “automaticity”. This led her to develop a new the- oretical account (see Figure 5.22). A key assumption is that all information Figure 5.22 Factors that are hypothesised to influence representational quality within Moors’ (2016) theoretical approach. From Moors (2016).

What factors determine representational quality? (1) current stimulus factors, including the extent to which a stimulus is expected or unexpected, familiar or novel, and goal congruent or incongruent; (2) prior stimulus factors (e.g., the frequency and recency with which the current stimulus has been encountered); (3) prior stimulus representation factors based on relevant information stored within long-term memory; (4) attention, which enhances or amplifies the impact of current stimulus factors and prior stimulus representation factors on the current stim- ulus representation. According to this theoretical account, the above factors influence repre- sentational quality additively so that a high level of one factor can compen- sate for a low level of another factor. For example, selective attention or relevant information in long-term memory can compensate for brief stim- ulus presentations. The main impact of consciousness occurs later than for other factors (e.g., attention and goal congruence). More specifically, representational quality must reach the first threshold to permit uncon- scious processing but a more stringent second threshold to permit conscious processing. Findings According to Moors’ (2016) theoretical framework, there is a flexible rela- tionship between controlled and conscious processing. This contrasts with Schneider and Shiffrin’s (1977) assumption that executive control is always associated with conscious processing. Diao et al. (2016) reported findings consistent with Moors’ prediction. They used a Go/No-Go task where participants made a simple response (Go trials) or withheld it (No-Go trials). High-value or low-value financial rewards were available for successful performance. Task stimuli were pre- sented above or below the level of conscious awareness. What did Diao et al. (2016) find? Performance was better on high- reward than low-reward trials even when task processing was uncon- scious. In addition, participants showed superior unconscious inhibitory control (assessed by event-related potentials) on high-reward trials. Thus, one feature of automaticity (unconscious processing) was present whereas another feature (goal-uncontrolled) was not. Huber-Huber and Ansorge (2018) also reported problems for the tra- ditional approach. Participants received target words indicating an upward or downward direction (e.g., above; below). Prior to the target word, a prime word also indicating an upward or downward direction was pre- sented below the level of conscious awareness. Response times to the target words were slower when there was a conflict between the meanings of the prime and target words than when they were congruent in meaning.

(2016), unconscious processing was combined with control, a combination that is inconsistent with the traditional approach. Evaluation The theoretical approach to automaticity proposed by Moors (2016) has several strengths. First, the assumption that various features associated with automaticity often correlate poorly with each other is clearly superior to the earlier notion that these features exhibit perfect coherence. Second, her assumption that processes vary in the extent to which they are “automatic” is much more realistic than the simplistic division of processes into auto- matic and non-automatic. Third, the approach is more comprehensive than previous ones because it considers more factors relevant to “automaticity”. What are the limitations with Moors’ (2016) approach? First, numer- ous factors are assumed to influence representational quality (and thus the extent to which processes are automatic) (see Figure 5.22). It would thus require large-scale experimental research to assess the ways all these factors interact. Second, the approach provides only a partial explanation of the underlying mechanisms causing the various factors to influence representa- tional quality. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Focused auditory attention. When two auditory messages are presented at the same time, there is less processing of the unattended than the attended message. Nevertheless, unattended messages often receive some semantic processing. The restricted processing of unattended messages may reflect a bottleneck at various stages of processing. However, theories assuming the existence of a bottleneck de-emphasise the flexibility of selective auditory attention. Attending to one voice among several (the cocktail party problem) is a challenging task. Human listeners use top-down and bottom-up processes to select one voice. Top- down processes include the use of various control processes (e.g., focused attention; inhibitory processes) and learning about structural consistencies present in the to-be-attended voice. • Focused visual attention. Visual attention can resemble a spotlight or zoom lens. In addition, the phenomenon of split attention suggests visual attention can also resemble multiple spotlights. However, accounts based on spotlights or a zoom lens typically fail to specify the underlying mechanisms. Visual attention can be object-based, space-based or feature-based, and it is often object-based and space-based at the same time. Visual attention is flexible and is influenced by factors such as individual differences. According to Lavie’s load theory, we are more susceptible to distraction when our current task involves low perceptual load and/or high cognitive load. There is much support for this theory.

Interactive exercise: Definitions of attention Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:21:43.\n\n232 Visual perception and attention However, the effects of perceptual and cognitive load are often not independent as predicted. In addition, it is hard to test the theory because the terms “perceptual load” and “cognitive load” are vague. There are stimulus-driven ventral attention and goal- directed dorsal attention networks involving different (but partially overlapping) brain networks. More research is required to establish how these two attentional systems interact. Additional brain networks (e.g., cingulo-opercular network; default mode network) relevant to attention have also been identified. • Disorders of visual attention. Neglect occurs when damage to the ventral attention network in the right hemisphere impairs the functioning of the undamaged dorsal attention network. This impaired functioning of the dorsal attention network involves reduced activation and alertness within the left hemisphere. Extinction is due to biased competition for attention between the two hemispheres combined with reduced attentional capacity. More research is required to clarify differences among neglect patients in their specific processing deficits (e.g., the extent to which failures to detect left-field stimuli are due to impaired spatial working memory). • Visual search. One problem with airport security checks is that there are numerous possible target objects. Another problem is the rarity of targets, which leads to excessive caution in reporting targets. According to feature integration theory, object features are processed in parallel and then combined by focused attention in visual search. This theory ignores our use of general scene knowledge in everyday life to focus visual search on areas of the scene most likely to contain the target object. It also exaggerates the prevalence of serial processing. Contemporary approaches emphasise the role of perception in visual search. Parallel processing is very common because much information is typically extracted from the peripheral visual field as well as from central or foveal vision. Problems in visual search occur when there is visual crowding in peripheral vision. • Cross-modal effects. In the real world, we often coordinate information across sense modalities. In the ventriloquist effect, vision dominates sound because an object’s location is typically indicated more precisely by vision. In the temporal ventriloquism effect, sound dominates vision because the auditory modality is typically more precise at discriminating temporal relations. Both effects depend on the assumption that visual and auditory stimuli come from the same object. Auditory or vibrotactile warning signals that are informative about the direction of danger and/or imminence of collision speed up drivers’ braking times. We lack a theoretical framework within which to understand why some warning signals are more effective than others.

Individuals engaging in heavy multi-tasking show evidence of increased distractibility and impaired attentional control. A demanding secondary task (e.g., mobile-phone use) impairs aspects of driving performance requiring cognitive control but not well-practised driving skills (e.g., lane keeping). Multiple resource theory and threaded cognition theory both assume dual-task performance depends on several limited-capacity processing resources. This permits two tasks to be performed together successfully provided they use different processing resources. This general approach de-emphasises high- level executive processes (e.g., monitoring and coordinating two tasks). Some neuroimaging studies have found underadditivity in dual-task conditions (less activation than for the two tasks performed separately). This may indicate people have limited general processing resources. Other neuroimaging studies have found dual-task conditions can introduce new processing demands of task coordination associated with activation within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. It is often unclear whether patterns of brain activation are directly relevant to task processing. The psychological refractory period (PRP) effect can be explained by a processing bottleneck during response selection. This remains the most influential explanation. However, some evidence supports resource models claiming parallel processing of two tasks is often possible. Such models are more flexible than bottleneck models and they provide an explanation for interference effects from the second of two tasks on the first one. • “Automatic” processing. Shiffrin and Schneider distinguished between slow, flexible controlled processes and fast, automatic ones. This distinction is greatly oversimplified. Other theorists have claimed automatic processes are unconscious, efficient, fast and goal-unrelated. However, these four processing features are not all-or-none and they often correlate poorly with each other. Thus, there is no sharp distinction between automatic and non-automatic processes. Moors’ (2016) decompositional approach plausibly assumes that there is considerable flexibility in terms of the extent to which any given process is “automatic”.

Imagine if we were without it. We would not recognise anyone or anything as familiar. We would be unable to talk, read or write because we would remember nothing about language. We would have extremely limited personalities because we would have no recollection of the events of our own lives and therefore no sense of self. In sum, we would have the same lack of knowledge as a newborn baby. Nairne et al. (2007) argued there were close links between memory and sur- vival in our evolutionary history. Our ancestors prioritised information rele- vant to their survival (e.g., remembering the location of food or water; ways of securing a mate). Nairne et al. found memory for word lists was espe- cially high when participants rated the words for their relevance to survival in a dangerous environment: the survival-processing effect. This effect has been replicated several times (Kazanas & Altarriba, 2015) and is stronger when participants imagine themselves alone in a dangerous environment rather than with a group of friends (Leding & Toglia, 2018). In sum, human memory may have evolved in part to promote survival. We use memory for numerous purposes throughout every day of our lives. It allows us to keep track of conversations, to remember how to use a mobile phone, to write essays in examinations, to recognise other people’s faces, to take part in conversations, to ride a bicycle, to carry out intentions and, perhaps, to play various sports. More generally, our interactions with others and with the environment depend crucially on having an effective memory system. The wonders of human memory are discussed at length in Chapters 6–8. Chapter 6 deals mainly with key issues regarded as important from the early days of memory research. For example, we consider the distinction between short-term and long-term memory. The notion of short-term memory has been largely superseded by that of a working-memory system combining the functions of processing and short-term information storage. There is extensive coverage of working memory in Chapter 6. Another topic discussed at length in Chapter 6 is learning. Long-term memory is generally enhanced when meaning is processed at the time of learning.

Long-term memory is also better if much of the learning period Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\n238 Memory is spent practising retrieval. Evidence suggesting some learning is implicit (i.e., does not depend on conscious processes) is also discussed. Finally, we discuss forgetting. Why do we tend to forget information over time? Chapter 7 is devoted to long-term memory. Our long-term memories include personal information, knowledge about language, much knowledge about psychology (hopefully!), knowledge about thousands of objects in the world around us, and information about how to perform various skills (e.g., riding a bicycle; playing the piano). The central issue addressed in Chapter 7 is how to account for this incredible richness. Several theorists have claimed there are several long-term memory systems. Others argue that there are numerous processes that are combined and recombined depending on the specific demands of any given memory task. Memory is important in everyday life in ways de-emphasised historically. For example, autobiographical memory (discussed in Chapter 8) is of great significance to us. It gives us a coherent sense of ourselves and our person- alities. The other topics considered in Chapter 8 are eyewitness testimony and prospective memory (memory for future intentions). Research into eye- witness testimony has revealed that eyewitness testimony is often much less accurate than generally assumed. This has implications for the legal system because hundreds of innocent individuals have been imprisoned solely on the basis of eyewitness testimony. When we think about memory, we naturally focus on memory of the past. However, we also need to remember numerous future commitments (e.g., meeting a friend as arranged), and such remembering involves prospective memory. We will consider how we try to ensure we carry out our future intentions. The study of human memory is fascinating, and substantial progress has been made. However, it is complex and depends on several factors. Four kinds of factors are especially important: events, participants, encoding and retrieval (Roediger, 2008). Events range from words and pictures to texts and life events. Participants vary in age, expertise, memory-specific dis- orders and so on. What happens at encoding varies as a function of task instructions, the immediate context and participants’ strategies. Finally, memory performance at retrieval often varies considerably depending on the nature of the memory task (e.g., free recall; cued recall; recognition). The take-home message is that memory findings are context-sensitive – they depend on interactions between the four factors. Thus, the effects of manipulating, say, what happens at encoding depend on the participants used, the events to be remembered and the conditions of retrieval. That explains why Roediger (2008) entitled his article, “Why the laws of memory vanished”. How, then, do we make progress? As Baddeley (1978, p. 150) argued, “The most fruitful way to extend our understanding of human memory is not to search for broader generalisations and ‘principles’, but is rather to develop ways of separating out and analysing more deeply the complex underlying processes.” Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["me of learning.","Long-term memory is also better if much of the learning period Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32."]}

All three chap- ters deal with intact human memory, but Chapter 7 also considers amnesic patients in detail. Traditional laboratory-based research is the focus of this chapter and Chapter 7, with more naturalistic research being discussed in Chapter 8. There are important links among these different types of research. For example, many theoretical issues relevant to brain-damaged and healthy individuals can be tested in the laboratory or in the field. Learning and memory involve several stages of processing. Encoding occurs during learning: it involves transforming presented information into a representation that can subsequently be stored. This is the first stage. As a result of encoding, information is stored within the memory system. Thus, storage is the second stage. The third stage is retrieval, which involves recovering information from the memory system. Forgetting (dis- cussed later, see pp. 278–293) occurs when our attempts at retrieval are unsuccessful. Several topics are discussed in this chapter. The basic structure of the chapter consists of three sections: (1) The first section focuses mostly on short-term memory (a form of memory in which information is held for a brief period of time). This section has three topics (short-term vs long-term memory; working memory; and working memory: executive functions and individual differences). The emphasis here is on the early stages of processing (especially encoding). (2) The second section focuses on learning and the processes occurring during the acquisition of information (i.e., encoding processes) leading to long-term memory. Learning can be explicit (occurring with conscious awareness of what has been learned) or implicit (occurring without conscious awareness of what has been learned). The first two topics in this section (levels of processing; learning through retrieval) focus on explicit learning whereas the third topic focuses on implicit learning.

The emphasis differs from the other two sections in that the emphasis is on retrieval processes rather than encoding processes. More specifically, the focus is on the reasons responsible for the fail- ures of retrieval. SHORT-TERM VS LONG-TERM MEMORY Many theorists distinguish between short-term and long-term memory. For example, there are enormous differences in capacity: only a few items can be held in short-term memory compared with essentially unlimited capac- ity in long-term memory. There are also massive differences in duration: a few seconds for short-term memory compared with up to several decades for long-term memory. The distinction between short-term and long-term memory stores was central to multi-store models. More recently, however, some theorists have proposed unitary-store models in which this distinction is much less clear-cut. Both types of models are discussed below. Multi-store model Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) proposed an extremely influential multi-store model (see Figure 6.1): ● sensory stores, each modality-specific (i.e., limited to one sensory modality) and holding information very briefly; ● short-term store of very limited capacity; ● long-term store of essentially unlimited capacity holding information over very long periods of time. According to the multi-store model, environmental stimulation is initially processed by the sensory stores. These stores are modality-specific (e.g., vision; hearing). Information is held very briefly in the sensory stores, with some being attended to and processed further within the short-term store. Sensory stores The visual store (iconic memory) holds visual information briefly. According to a recent estimate (Clarke & Mack, 2015), iconic memory for a natural scene lasts for at least 1,000 ms after stimulus offset. If you twirl KEY TERM Iconic memory A sensory store that holds visual information for between 250–1,000 milliseconds following the offset of a visual stimulus.

More generally, iconic memory increases the time for which visual information is accessible (e.g., when reading). Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) and many other theorists have assumed iconic memory is pre-attentive (not dependent on attention). However, Mack et al. (2016) obtained findings strongly suggesting that iconic memory does depend on attention. Participants had to report the letters in the centre of a visual array (iconic memory) or whether four circles pre- sented close to the fixation point were the same colour. Performance on the iconic memory task was much worse when the probability of having to perform the iconic memory task was only 10% rather than 90%. This happened because there was much less attention to the letters in the former condition. Echoic memory, the auditory equivalent of iconic memory, holds audi- tory information for a few seconds. Suppose someone asked you a ques- tion while your mind was elsewhere. Perhaps you replied “What did you say?”, just before realising you did know what had been said. This “play- back” facility depends on echoic memory. Ioannides et al. (2003) found the duration of echoic memory was longer in the left hemisphere than the right, probably because of the dominance of the left hemisphere in lan- guage processing. There are sensory stores associated with all other senses (e.g., touch; taste). However, they are less important than iconic and echoic memory and have attracted much less research. Short-term memory Short-term memory has very limited capacity. Consider digit span: par- ticipants listen to a random digit series and then repeat back the digits immediately in the correct order. There are also letter and word spans. The maximum number of items recalled without error is typically about seven. There are two reasons for rejecting seven items as the capacity of short-term memory. First, we must distinguish between items and chunks – “groups of items . . . collected together and treated as a single unit” (Mathy & Feldman, 2012, p. 346). For example, most individuals presented with the letter string IBMCIAFBI would treat it as three chunks rather than nine letters. Here is another example: you might find it hard to recall the following five words: is thing many-splendoured a love but easier to recall the same words presented as follows: love is a many-splendoured thing. Simon (1974) showed the importance of chunking. Immediate serial recall was 22 words with 8-word sentences but only 7 with unrelated words. In contrast, the number of chunks recalled varied less: it was 3 with the sentences compared to 7 with the unrelated words. Second, estimates of short-term memory capacity are often inflated because participants’ perfor- mance is influenced by rehearsal and long-term memory. What influences chunking? As we have seen, it is strongly determined by information stored in long-term memory (e.g., IBM stands for International Business Machines). However, chunking also depends on people’s abilities to identify patterns or regularities in the material presented for learning. KEY TERMS Echoic memory A sensory store that holds auditory information for approximately 2–3 seconds. Chunks Stored units formed from integrating smaller pieces of information.

It is much easier to chunk the former sequence as “all digits between 2 and 6”. Chekaf et al. (2016) found participants’ short-term memory was greatly enhanced by spontaneous detection of such patterns. When there were no patterns in the learning material, short-term memory was only three items. A similar capacity limit was reported by Chen and Cowan (2009). When rehearsal was prevented by articulatory suppression (saying “the” repeatedly), only three chunks were recalled. Within the multi-store model, it is assumed all items within short-term memory have equal importance. However, this is an oversimplification. Vergauwe and Langerock (2017) assessed speed of performance when par- ticipants were presented with four letters followed by a probe letter and decided whether the probe was the same as any of the original letters. Response to the probe was fastest when it corresponded to the letter cur- rently being attended to (cues were used to manipulate which letter was the focus of attention at any given moment). How is information lost from short-term memory? Several answers have been provided (Endress & Szabó, 2017). Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) emphasised the importance of displacement – the capacity of short-term memory is very limited, and so new items often displace items currently in short-term memory. Another possibility is that information in short-term memory decays over time in the absence of rehearsal. A further possibility is interference which could come from items on previous trials and/or from information presented during the retention interval. The experimental findings are variable. Berman et al. (2009) claimed interference is more important than decay. Short-term memory perfor- mance on any given trial was disrupted by words presented on the previ- ous trial. Suppose this disruption effect occurred because words from the previous trial had not decayed sufficiently. If so, disruption would have been greatly reduced by increasing the inter-trial interval. In fact, increas- ing that interval had no effect. However, the disruption effect was largely eliminated when interference from previous trials was reduced. Campoy (2012) pointed out Berman et al.’s (2009) research was limited because their experimental design did not allow them to observe any decay occurring within 3.3 seconds of item presentation. Campoy obtained strong decay effects at time intervals shorter than 3.3 seconds. Overall, the find- ings suggest decay occurs mostly at short retention intervals and interfer- ence at longer ones. Strong evidence interference is important was reported by Endress and Potter (2014). They rapidly presented 5, 11 or 21 pictures of familiar objects. In their unique condition, no pictures were repeated over trials, whereas in their repeated condition, the same pictures were seen frequently over trials. Short-term memory was greater in the unique condition in which there was much less interference than in the repeated condition (see Figure 6.2). In sum, most of the evidence indicates that interference is the most important factor causing forgetting from short-term memory, although decay may also play a part. There is little direct evidence that displace- ment (emphasised by Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968) is the main factor causing forgetting. However, it is possible that interference causes items to be dis- placed from short-term memory (Endress & Szabó, 2017).

If they are separate, we would expect some patients to have impaired long-term memory but intact short-term memory with others showing the opposite pattern. This would produce a double dissociation (see Glossary). The findings are generally support- ive. Patients with amnesia (discussed in Chapter 7) have severe long-term memory impairments but nearly all have intact short-term memory (Spiers et al., 2001). A few brain-damaged patients have severely impaired short-term memory but intact long-term memory. For example, KF had no prob- lems with long-term learning and recall but had a very small digit span (Shallice & Warrington, 1970). Subsequent research indicated his short- term memory problems focused mainly on recall of verbal material (letters; words; digits) rather than meaningful sounds or visual stimuli (Shallice & Warrington, 1974). Evaluation The multi-store model has been enormously influential. It is widely accepted (but see below) that there are three separate kinds of memory stores. Several sources of experimental evidence support the crucial distinction between short-term and long-term memory. However, the strongest evidence proba- bly comes from brain-damaged patients having impairments only to short- term or long-term memory. What are the model’s limitations? First, it is very oversimplified (e.g., the assumptions that the short-term and long-term stores are both unitary: operating in a single, uniform way). Below we discuss an approach where the single short-term store is replaced by a working memory system having four components. In similar fashion, there are several long-term memory systems (see Chapter 7).

The information processed in short-term memory has typically already made contact with information in long-term memory (Logie, 1999). For example, you can only process IBM as a single chunk in short-term memory after you have accessed long-term memory to obtain the meaning of IBM. Third, Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) assumed information in short- term memory represents the “contents of consciousness”. This implies only information processed consciously is stored in long-term memory. However, there is much evidence for implicit learning (learning without conscious awareness of what has been learned) (discussed later, see pp. 269–278). Fourth, the assumption all items within short-term memory have equal status is incorrect. The item currently being attended to is accessed more rapidly than other items within short-term memory (Vergauwe & Langerock, 2017). Fifth, the notion that most information is transferred to long-term memory via rehearsal greatly exaggerates its role in learning. In fact, only a small fraction of the information stored in long-term memory was rehearsed during learning. Sixth, the notion that forgetting from short-term memory is caused by displacement minimises the role of interference. Unitary-store model Several theorists have argued the multi-store approach should be replaced by a unitary-store model. According to such a model, “STM [short-term memory] consists of temporary activations of LTM [long-term memory] representations or of representations of items that were recently per- ceived” (Jonides et al., 2008, p. 198). In essence, Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) emphasised the differences between short-term and long-term memory whereas advocates of the unitary-store approach focus on the similarities. How can unitary-store models explain amnesic patients having essen- tially intact short-term memory but severely impaired long-term memory? Jonides et al. (2008) argued they have special problems in forming novel relations (e.g., between items and their context) in both short-term and long-term memory. Amnesic patients perform well on short-term memory tasks because such tasks typically do not require storing relational infor- mation. Thus, amnesic patients should have impaired short-term memory performance on tasks requiring relational memory. According to Jonides et al. (2008), the hippocampus and surround- ing medial temporal lobes (damaged in amnesic patients) are crucial for forming novel relations. Multi-store theorists assume these structures are much more involved in long-term than short-term memory. However, unitary-store models predict the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes would be involved if a short-term memory task required forming novel relations.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nLearning, memory and forgetting 245 Findings Several studies have assessed the performance of amnesic patients on short-term memory tasks. In some studies (e.g., Hannula et al., 2006) the performance of amnesic patients was impaired. However, Jeneson and Squire (2012) in a review found these allegedly short-term memory studies also involved long-term memory. More specifically, the information to be learned exceeded the capacity of short-term memory and so necessarily involved long-term memory as well as short-term memory (Norris, 2017). As a result, such studies do not demonstrate deficient short-term memory in amnesic patients. Several neuroimaging studies have reported hippocampal involvement (thought to be crucial for long-term memory) during short-term memory tasks. However, it has generally been unclear whether hippocampal activa- tion was due in part to encoding for long-term memory. An exception was a study by Bergmann et al. (2012). They assessed short-term memory for face–house pairs followed by an unexpected test of long-term memory for the pairs. What did Bergmann et al. (2012) find? Encoding of pairs remembered in both short- and long-term memory involved the hippocampus. However, there was no hippocampal activation at encoding when short-term memory for word pairs was successful but subsequent long-term memory was not. Thus, the hippocampus was only involved on a short-term memory task when long-term memories were being formed. Evaluation As predicted by the unitary-store approach, activation of part of long-term memory often plays an important role in short-term memory. More specif- ically, relevant information from long-term memory frequently influences the contents of short-term memory. What are the limitations of the unitary-store approach? First, the claim that short-term memory consists only of activated long-term memory is oversimplified. As Norris (2017, p. 992) pointed out, “The central problem . . . is that STM has to be able to store arbitrary configurations of novel information. For example, we can remember novel sequences of words or dots in random positions on a screen. These cannot possibly have pre-existing representations in LTM that could be activated.” Short-term memory is also more flexible than expected on the unitary-store approach (e.g., backward digit recall: recalling digits in the opposite order to the one presented). Second, we must distinguish between the assumption that short-term memory is only activated long-term memory and the assumption that short-term and long-term memory are separate but often interact. Most evidence supports the latter assumption rather than the former. Third, the theory fails to provide a precise definition of the crucial explanatory concept of “activation”. It is thus unclear how activation might maintain representations in short-term memory (Norris, 2017). Fourth, the medial temporal lobes (including the hippocampus) are of crucial importance for many forms of long-term memory (especially Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["ould be involved if a short-term memory task required forming novel relations.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32."]}

Amnesic patients with damage to these brain areas have severely impaired declarative memory. In contrast, amnesic patients typically have intact short-term memory (Spiers et al., 2001). WORKING MEMORY: BADDELEY AND HITCH Is short-term memory useful in everyday life? Textbook writers used to argue it allows us to remember a telephone number for the few seconds required to dial it. Of course, that is now irrelevant – our mobile phones store all the phone numbers we need regularly. Baddeley and Hitch (1974) provided a convincing answer to the above question. They argued we typically use short-term memory when performing complex tasks. Such tasks involve storing information about the outcome of early processes in short-term memory while moving on to later processes. Baddeley and Hitch’s key insight was that short-term memory is essen- tial to the performance of numerous tasks that are not explicitly memory tasks. The above line of thinking led Baddeley and Hitch (1974) to replace the concept of short-term memory with that of working memory. Working memory “refers to a system, or a set of processes, holding mental rep- resentations temporarily available for use in thought and action” (Oberauer et al., 2018, p. 886). Since 1974, there have been several developments of the working memory system (Baddeley, 2012, 2017; see Figure 6.3): Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch.

The most important component is the central executive. The phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad are slave systems used by the central executive for specific purposes. The phonological loop preserves word order, whereas the visuo-spatial sketchpad stores and manipulates spatial and visual information. All three components discussed above have limited capacity and can function fairly independently of the others. Two key assumptions follow: (1) If two tasks use the same component, they cannot be performed suc- cessfully together. (2) If two tasks use different components, they can be performed as well together as separately. Robbins et al. (1996) investigated these assumptions in a study on the selection of chess moves. Chess players selected continuation moves from various chess positions while also performing one of the following tasks: ● repetitive tapping: the control condition; ● random letter generation: this involves the central executive; ● pressing keys on a keypad in a clockwise fashion: this uses the visuo-spatial sketchpad; ● rapid repetition of the word “see-saw”: this is articulatory suppression and uses the phonological loop. The quality of chess moves was impaired when the additional task involved the central executive or visuo-spatial sketchpad but not when it involved the articulatory loop. Thus, calculating successful chess moves requires use of the central executive and the visuo-spatial sketchpad but not the articu- latory loop. Phonological loop According to the working memory model, the phonological loop has two components (see Figure 6.4): ● a passive phonological store directly concerned with speech perception; ● an articulatory process linked to speech production (i.e., rehearsal) giving access to the phonological store. KEY TERMS Working memory A limited-capacity system used in the processing and brief holding of information. Central executive A modality-free, limited- capacity, component of working memory. Phonological loop A component of working memory in which speech- based information is processed and stored briefly and subvocal articulation occurs. Visuo-spatial sketchpad A component of working memory used to process visual and spatial information and to store this information briefly.

Would they use the phonological loop to engage in verbal rehearsal (i.e., saying the words repeatedly to themselves)? Two kinds of evidence (discussed below) indicate the answer is “Yes”. First, there is the phonological similarity effect – reduced immediate serial recall when words are phonologically similar (i.e., have similar sounds). For example, Baddeley et al. (2018) found that short-term memory was much worse with phonologically similar words (e.g., pan, cat, bat, ban, pad, man) than phonologically dissimilar words (e.g., man, pen, rim, cod, bud, peel). The working memory model does not make it clear whether the phono- logical similarity effect depends more on acoustic similarity (similar sounds) or articulatory similarity (similar articulatory movements). Schweppe et al. (2011) found the effect depends more on acoustic than articulatory similar- ity. However, there was an influence of articulatory similarity when recall was spoken. Second, there is the word-length effect: word span (words recalled immediately in the correct order) is greater for short than long words. Baddeley et al. (1975) obtained this effect with visually presented words. As predicted, the effect disappeared when participants engaged in articulatory suppression (repeating the digits 1 to 8) to prevent rehearsal within the phonological loop during list presentation. In similar fashion, Jacquemot et al. (2011) found a brain-damaged patient with greatly impaired ability to engage in verbal rehearsal had no word-length effect. Jalbert et al. (2011) pointed out a short word generally has more orthographic neighbours (words of the same length differing from it in only one letter) than a long word. When short (one-syllable) and long (three-syllable) words were equated for neighbourhood size, the word- length effect disappeared. Thus, the word-length effect may be misnamed. Which brain areas are associated with the phonological loop? Areas in the parietal lobe, especially the supramarginal gyrus (BA40) and angular gyrus (BA39), are associated with the phonological store, whereas Broca’s area (approximately BA44 and BA45) within the frontal lobe is associated with the articulatory control process. Evidence indicating these areas differ in their functioning was reported by Papagno et al. (2017). Patients undergoing brain surgery received direct KEY TERMS Phonological similarity effect The finding that immediate serial recall of verbal material is reduced when the items sound similar.

Stimulation within the parietal lobe increased item errors in the task because it disrupted the storage of information. In contrast, stimulation within Broca’s area increased order errors because it disrupted rehearsal of items in the correct order (see Figure 6.5). How is the phonological loop useful in every- day life? The answer is not immediately obvious. Baddeley et al. (1988) found a female patient, PV, with a very small digit span (only two items) coped very well (e.g., running a shop and raising a family). In subsequent research, however, Baddeley et al. (1998) argued the phonological loop is useful when learning a language. PV (a native Italian speaker) had generally good learning ability but was totally unable to associate Russian words with their Italian translations. Indeed, she showed no learning at all over ten trials! The phonological loop (“inner voice”) is also used to resist temptation. Tullett and Inzlicht (2010) found articulatory suppression (saying computer repeatedly) reduced participants’ ability to control their actions (they were more likely to respond on trials where they should have inhibited a response). Visuo-spatial sketchpad The visuo-spatial sketchpad is used for the temporary storage and manipu- lation of visual patterns and spatial movement. In essence, visual processing involves remembering what and spatial processing involves remembering where. In everyday life, we use the sketchpad to find the route when moving from one place to another or when watching television. The distinction between visual and spatial processing is very clear with respect to blind individuals. Schmidt et al. (2013) found blind individuals could construct spatial representations of the environment almost as accurately as those of sighted individuals despite their lack of visual processing. Is there a single system containing combining visual and spatial pro- cessing or are there partially separate systems? Logie (1995) identified two separate components: (1) visual cache: this stores information about visual form and colour; (2) inner scribe: this processes spatial and movement information; it is involved in the rehearsal of information in the visual cache and trans- fers information from the visual cache to the central executive. Smith and Jonides (1997) obtained findings supporting the notion of sepa- rate visual and spatial systems. Two visual stimuli presented together were followed by a probe stimulus. Participants decided whether the probe was in the same location as one of the initial stimuli (spatial task) or had the same form (visual task). Even though the stimuli presented were identical in Figure 6.5 Sites where direct electrical stimulation disrupted digit- span performance. Item-error sites are in blue, order- error sites are in yellow and sites where both types of errors occurred are in green. KEY TERMS Visual cache According to Logie, the part of the visuo-spatial sketchpad that stores information about visual form and colour. Inner scribe According to Logie, the part of the visuo-spatial sketchpad dealing with spatial and movement information.

Zimmer (2008) found in a research review that areas within the occipital and temporal lobes were activated during visual processing. In contrast, areas within the parietal cortex (especially the intraparietal sulcus) were acti- vated during spatial processing. Klauer and Zhao (2004) used two main tasks: (1) a spatial task (memory for dot loca- tions); (2) a visual task (memory for Chinese characters). The main task was performed at the same time as a visual (colour discrimina- tion) or spatial (movement discrimination) interference task. If the visuo-spatial sketch- pad has separate spatial and visual compo- nents, the spatial interference task should disrupt performance more on the spatial main task. Second, the visual interference task should disrupt per- formance more on the visual main task. Both predictions were supported (see Figure 6.6). Vergauwe et al. (2009) argued that visual and spatial tasks often require the central executive’s attentional resources. They used more demanding versions of Klauer and Zhao’s (2004) main tasks and obtained different findings: each type of interference (visual and spatial) had compa- rable effects on the spatial and visual main tasks. Thus, there are general, attentionally demanding interference effects when tasks are demanding but also interference effects specific to the type of interference when tasks are relatively undemanding. Morey (2018) discussed the theoretical assumption that the visuo- spatial sketchpad is a specialised system separate from other cognitive systems and components of working memory. She identified two predic- tions following from that assumption: (1) Some brain-damaged patients should have selective impairments of visual and/or spatial short-term memory with other cognitive pro- cesses and systems essentially intact. (2) Short-term visual or spatial memory in healthy individuals should be largely or wholly unaffected by the requirement to perform a second- ary task at the same time (especially when that task does not require visual or spatial processing). Morey (2018) reviewed evidence inconsistent with both the above predic- tions. First, the great majority of brain-damaged patients with impaired visual and/or spatial short-term memory also have various more general cognitive impairments. Second, Morey carried out a meta-analytic review and found that short-term visual and spatial memory was strongly impaired by cognitively demanding secondary tasks. This was the case even when the secondary task did not require visual or spatial processing.

However, the visuo-spatial sketchpad seems to interact extensively with other cogni- tive and memory systems, which casts doubt on the theoretical assumption that it often operates independently from other systems. Central executive The central executive (which resembles an attentional system) is the most important and versatile component of the working memory system. It is heavily involved in almost all complex cognitive activities (e.g., solving a problem; carrying out two tasks at the same time) but does not store information. There is much controversy concerning the brain regions most asso- ciated with the central executive and its various functions (see below, pp. 257–262). However, it is generally assumed the prefrontal cortex is heavily involved. Mottaghy (2006) reviewed studies using repetitive tran- scranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; see Glossary) to disrupt the dorsolat- eral prefrontal cortex (BA9/46). Performance on many complex cognitive tasks was impaired by this manipulation. However, executive processes do not depend solely on the prefrontal cortex. Many brain-damaged patients (e.g., those with diffuse trauma) have poor executive functioning despite having little or no frontal damage (Stuss, 2011). Baddeley has always recognised that the central executive is associated with several executive functions (see Glossary). For example, Baddeley (1996) speculatively identified four such processes: (1) focusing attention or concentration; (2) dividing attention between two stimulus streams; (3) switching attention between tasks; and (4) interfacing with long- term memory. It has proved difficult to obtain consensus on the number and nature of executive processes. However, two influential theoretical approaches are discussed below. Brain-damaged individuals whose central executive functioning is impaired suffer from dysexecutive syndrome. Symptoms include impaired response inhibition, rule deduction and generation, maintenance and shifting of sets, and information generation (Godefroy et al., 2010). Unsurprisingly, patients with this syndrome have great problems in holding a job and functioning adequately in everyday life (Chamberlain, 2003). Evaluation The notion of a unitary central executive is greatly oversimplified (see below). As Logie (2016, p. 2093) argued, “Executive control [may] arise from the interaction among multiple differing functions in cognition that use different, but overlapping, brain networks . . . the central executive might now be offered a dignified retirement.” Similar criticisms can be directed against the notion of a dysexecutive syndrome. Patients with widespread damage to the frontal lobes may have a global dysexecutive syndrome. However, as discussed below, patients with limited frontal damage display various patterns of impairment to executive processes (Stuss & Alexander, 2007).

First, the original version of the model was limited because its components were too separate in their functioning. For example, it was unclear how verbal information from the phonological loop and visual and spatial infor- mation from the visuo-spatial sketchpad was integrated to form multidi- mensional representations. Second, it was hard to explain within the original model the finding that people can provide immediate recall of up to 16 words presented in sentences (Baddeley et al., 1987). This high level of immediate sentence recall is substantially beyond the capacity of the phonological loop. The function of the episodic buffer is suggested by its name. It is episodic because it holds integrated information (or chunks) about epi- sodes or event in a multidimensional code combining visual, auditory and other information sources. It acts as a buffer between the other working memory components and also links to perception and long-term memory. Baddeley (2012) suggested the capacity of the episodic buffer is approx- imately four chunks (integrated units of information). This potentially explains why people can recall up to 16 words in immediate recall from sentences. Baddeley (2000) argued the episodic buffer could be accessed only via the central executive. However, it is now assumed the episodic buffer can be accessed by the visuo-spatial sketchpad and the phonological loop as well as by the central executive (see Figure 6.3). In sum, the episodic buffer differed from the existing subsystems representations [i.e., phonolog- ical loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad] in being able to hold a limited number of multi-dimensional representations or episodes, and it dif- fered from the central executive in having storage capacity . . . The episodic buffer is a passive storage system, the screen on which bound information from other sources could be made available to conscious awareness and used for planning future action. (Baddeley, 2017, pp. 305–306) Findings Why did Baddeley abandon his original assumption that the central exec- utive controls access to and from the episodic buffer? Consider a study by Allen et al. (2012). Participants were presented with visual stimuli and had to remember briefly a single feature (colour; shape) or colour–shape combi- nations. It was assumed combining visual features would require the central executive prior to storage in the episodic buffer. On that assumption, the requirement to perform a task requiring the central executive (counting backwards) at the same time should have reduced memory to a greater extent for colour–shape combinations than single features. Allen et al. (2012) found that counting backwards had comparable effects on memory performance regardless of whether or not feature com- binations needed to be remembered.

Grot et al. (2018) clarified the relationship between the central execu- tive and the episodic buffer. Participants learned to link or bind together words and spatial locations within the episodic buffer for a memory test. It was either relatively easy to bind words and spatial locations together (passive binding) or relatively difficult (active binding). The central executive was involved only in the more difficult active binding condition. Darling et al. (2017) discussed several studies showing how memory can be enhanced by the episodic buffer. Much of this research focused on visuo-spatial bootstrapping (verbal memory being bootstrapped (supported) by visuo-spatial memory). Consider a study by Darling and Havelka (2010). Immediate serial recall of random digits was best when they were presented on a keypad display rather on a single item or linear display (see Figure 6.7). Why was memory performance best with the keypad display? This was the only condition which allowed visual information, spatial information and knowledge about keyboard displays accessed from long-term memory to be integrated within the episodic buffer using bootstrapping. Evaluation The episodic buffer provides a brief storage facility for information from the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad and long-term memory. Bootstrapping data (e.g., Darling & Havelka, 2010) suggest that processing in the episodic buffer “interacts with long-term knowledge to enable inte- gration across multiple independent stimulus modalities” (Darling et al., 2017, p. 7). The central executive is most involved when it is hard to bind together different kinds of information within the episodic buffer. What are the limitations of research on the episodic buffer? First, it remains unclear precisely how information from the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad is combined to form unified representations within the episodic buffer. Second, as shown in Figure 6.3, it is assumed information from sensory modalities other than vision and hearing can be stored in the episodic buffer. However, relevant research on smell and taste is lacking. Figure 6.7 Screen displays for the digit 6. Clockwise from top left: (1) single item display; (2) keypad display; and (3) linear display.

There is convincing empirical evidence for all com- ponents of the model. As Logie (2015, p. 100) noted, it explains findings “from a very wide range of research topics, for example, aspects of chil- dren’s language development, aspects of counting and mental arithmetic, reasoning and problem solving, dividing and switching attention, navigat- ing unfamiliar environments”. What are the model’s limitations? First, it is oversimplified. Several kinds of information are not considered within the model (e.g., those relating to smell, touch and taste). In addition, we can subdivide spatial working memory into somewhat separate eye-centred, hand-centred and foot-centred spatial working memory (Postle, 2006). This could lead to an unwieldy model with numerous components each responsible for a differ- ent kind of information. Second, the notion of a central executive should be replaced with a theoretical approach identifying the major executive processes (see below, pp. 257–262). Third, the notion that the visuo-spatial sketchpad is a specialised and relatively independent processing system is doubtful. There is much evi- dence (Morey, 2018) that it typically interacts with other working memory components (especially the central executive). Fourth, we need more research on the interactions among the four components of working memory (e.g., how the episodic buffer integrates information from the other components and from long-term memory). Fifth, the common assumption that conscious awareness is necessar- ily associated with processing in all working memory components requires further consideration. For example, executive processes associated with the functioning of the central executive can perhaps occur outside con- scious awareness (Soto & Silvanto, 2014). As discussed in Chapter 16, many complex processes can apparently occur in the absence of conscious awareness. WORKING MEMORY: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS There have been numerous recent attempts to enhance our understanding of working memory. Here we will focus on two major theoretical approaches. First, some theorists (e.g., Engle & Kane, 2004) have focused on working memory capacity. In essence, they claim performance across numerous tasks (including memory ones) is strongly influenced by individual differ- ences in working memory capacity. Second, many theorists have replaced a unitary central executive with several more specific executive functions. Working memory capacity Several theorists (e.g., Engle & Kane, 2004) have considered working memory from the perspective of individual differences in working memory capacity, “the ability to hold and manipulate information in a temporary KEY TERM Working memory capacity An assessment of how much information can be processed and stored at the same time; individuals with high capacity have higher intelligence and more attentional control.

Daneman and Carpenter (1980) used reading span to assess this capacity. Individuals read sentences for comprehension (processing task) and then recalled the final word of each sentence (storage task). The reading span was defined as the largest number of sentences from which individuals could recall the final words over 50% of the time. Operation span is another measure of working memory capacity. Items (e.g., IS (4 × 2) – 3 = 5? TABLE) are presented. Individuals answer each arithmetical question and try to remember all the last words. Operation span is the maximum number of items for which individuals can remem- ber all the last words over half the time. It correlates highly with reading span. Working memory capacity correlates positively with intelligence. We can clarify this relationship by distinguishing between crystallised intelligence (which depends on knowledge, skills and experience) and fluid intelligence (which involves a rapid understanding of novel relationships; see Glossary). Working memory capacity correlates more strongly with fluid intelligence (sometimes as high as +.7 or +.8; Kovacs & Conway, 2016). The correlation with crystallised intelligence is relatively low because it involves acquired knowledge whereas working memory capacity depends on cognitive processes and temporary information storage. Engle and Kane (2004) argued individuals who are high and low in working memory capacity differ in attentional control. In their influential two-factor theory, they emphasised two key aspects of attentional control: (1) the maintenance of task goals; (2) the resolution of response competi- tion or conflict. Thus, high-capacity individuals are better at maintaining task goals and resolving conflict. How does working memory capacity relate to Baddeley’s working memory model? The two approaches differ in emphasis. Researchers inves- tigating working memory capacity focus on individual differences in pro- cessing and storage capacity whereas Baddeley focuses on the underlying structure of working memory. However, there has been some convergence between the two theoretical approaches. For example, Kovacs and Conway (2016, p. 157) concluded that working memory capacity “reflects individual differences in the executive component of working memory, particularly executive attention and cognitive control”. In view of the association between working memory capacity and intelligence, we would expect high-capacity individuals to outperform low-capacity ones on complex tasks. That is, indeed, the case (see Chapter 10). However, Engle and Kane’s (2004) theory also predicts high-capacity individuals might perform better than low-capacity ones even on relatively simple tasks if it were hard to maintain task goals. Findings There are close links between working memory capacity and the executive functions of the central executive. For example, McCabe et al. (2010) found measures of working memory capacity correlated highly with measures of executive functioning. Both types of measures reflect executive attention (which maintains task goals).

Sörqvist (2010) studied distraction effects caused by the sounds of planes flying past. Recall of a prose passage was adversely affected by distraction only in low-capacity individuals. Yurgil and Golob (2013), using event- related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary), found that high-capacity individuals attended less than low-capacity ones to distracting auditory stimuli. We have seen goal maintenance or attentional control in low- capacity individuals is disrupted by external distraction. It is also disrupted by inter- nal task-unrelated thoughts (mind-wandering). McVay and Kane (2012) used a sustained-attention task in which participants responded to frequent target words but withheld responses to rare non-targets. Low-capacity individuals performed worse than high-capacity ones on this task because they engaged in more mind-wandering. Robison and Unsworth (2018) identified two main reasons why this might be the case. First, low-capacity individuals’ inferior attentional control may lead to increased amounts of spontaneous or unplanned mind- wandering. Second, low-capacity individuals may be less motivated to perform cognitive tasks well and so engage in increased deliberate mind-wandering. Robison and Unsworth’s findings provided support only for the first reason. Individuals having low working memory capacity may have worse task performance than high-capacity ones because they consistently have poorer attentional control and ability to maintain the current task goal. Alternatively, their failures of attentional control may only occur relatively infrequently. Unsworth et al. (2012) compared these two explanations. They used the anti-saccade task: a flashing cue is presented to the left (or right) of fixation followed by a target presented in the opposite location. Reaction times to identify the target were recorded. Unsworth et al. (2012) divided each participant’s reaction times into quintiles (five bins representing the fastest 20%, the next fastest 20% and so on). Low-capacity individuals were significantly slower than the high- capacity ones only in the slowest quintile (see Figure 6.8). Thus, they expe- rienced failures of goal maintenance or attentional goal on only a small fraction of trials.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nLearning, memory and forgetting 257 Evaluation Theory and research on working memory capacity indicate the value of focusing on individual differences. There is convincing evidence high- and low-capacity individuals differ in attentional control. More specifically, high-capacity individuals are better at controlling external and internal distracting information. In addition, they are less likely than low-capacity individuals to experience failures of goal maintenance. Of importance, indi- vidual differences in working memory capacity are relevant to performance on numerous different tasks (see Chapter 10). What are the limitations of research in this area? First, the finding that working memory capacity correlates highly with fluid intelligence means many findings ascribed to individual differences in working memory capac- ity may actually reflect fluid intelligence. However, it can be argued that general executive functions relevant to working memory capacity partially explain individual differences in fluid intelligence (Kovacs & Conway, 2016). Second, research on working memory capacity is somewhat narrowly based on behavioural research with healthy participants. In contrast, the unity/diversity framework (discussed next) has been strongly influenced by neuroimaging and genetic research and by research on brain-damaged patients. Third, there is a lack of conceptual clarity. For example, theorists differ as to whether the most important factor differentiating individuals with high- or low-capacity is “maintenance of task goals”, “resolution of conflict”, “executive attention” or “cognitive control”. We do not know how closely related these terms are. Fourth, the inferior attentional or cognitive control of low-capacity individuals might manifest itself consistently throughout task performance or only sporadically. Relatively little research (e.g., Unsworth et al., 2012) has investigated this issue. Fifth, the emphasis in theory and research has been on the benefits for task performance associated with having high working memory capacity. However, some costs are associated with high capacity. These costs are manifest when the current task requires a broad focus of attention but high-capacity individuals adopt a narrow and inflexible focus (e.g., DeCaro et al., 2016, 2017; see Chapter 12). Executive functions: unity/diversity framework Executive functions are “high-level processes that, through their influ- ence on lower-level processes, enable individuals to regulate their thoughts and actions during goal-directed behaviour” (Friedman & Miyake, 2017, p. 186). The crucial issue is to identify the number and nature of these executive functions or processes. Various approaches can address this issue: (1) Psychometric approach: several tasks requiring the use of execu- tive functions are administered and the pattern of inter-correlations among the tasks is assessed. Consider the following hypothetical example. There are four executive tasks (A, B, C and D). There is a moderate positive correlation between tasks A and B and between C KEY TERMS Executive functions Processes that organise and coordinate the workings of the cognitive system to achieve current goals; key executive functions include inhibiting dominant responses, shifting attention and updating information in working memory.

Such a pattern sug- gests tasks A and B involve the same executive function whereas tasks C and D involve a different executive function. (2) Neuropsychological approach: the focus is on individuals with brain damage causing impaired executive functioning. Patterns of impaired functioning are related to the areas of brain damage to identify exec- utive functions and their locations within the brain. Shallice and Cipiolotti (2018) provide a thorough discussion of the applicability of this approach to understanding executive functioning. (3) Neuroimaging approach: the focus is on assessing similarities and dif- ferences in the patterns of brain activation associated with various executive tasks. For example, the existence of two executive functions (A and B) would be supported if they were associated with different patterns of brain activation. (4) Genetic approach: twin studies are conducted with an emphasis on showing different sets of genes are associated with each executive function (assessed by using appropriate cognitive tasks). Several theories have been proposed on the basis of evidence using the above approaches (see Friedman and Miyake, 2017, for a review). Here we will focus on the very influential theory originally proposed by Miyake et al. (2000) and developed subsequently (e.g., Friedman & Miyake, 2017). Unity/diversity framework In their initial study, Miyake et al. (2000) used the psychometric approach: they administered several executive tasks and then focused on the pattern of inter-correlations among the tasks. They identified three related (but sepa- rable) executive functions: (1) Inhibition function: used to deliberately override dominant responses and to resist distraction. For example, it is used on the Stroop task (see Figure 1.3 on p. 5), which involves naming the colours in which words are printed. When the words are conflicting colour words (e.g., the word BLUE printed in red), it is necessary to inhibit saying the word. (2) Shifting function: used to switch flexibly between tasks or mental sets. Suppose you are presented with two numbers on each trial. Your task is to switch between multiplying the two numbers and dividing one by the other on alternate trials. Such task switching requires the shifting function. (3) Updating function: used to monitor and engage in rapid addition or deletion of working memory contents. For example, this function is used if you must keep track of the most recent member of each of several categories. Subsequent research (e.g., Friedman et al., 2008; Miyake & Friedman, 2012) led to the development of the unity/diversity framework. The basic idea is that each executive function consists of what is common to all three executive functions (unity) plus what is unique to that function (diversity) (see Figure 6.9). After accounting for what was common to all executive KEY TERMS Stroop task A task in which participants have to name the ink colours in which colour words are printed; performance is slowed when the to-be-named colour (e.g., green) conflicts with the colour word (e.g., red).

Of importance, separable shifting and updating factors have consistently been identified in subsequent research (Friedman & Miyake, 2017). What is the nature of the common factor? According to Friedman and Miyake (2017, p. 194), “It reflects individual differences in the ability to maintain and manage goals, and use those goals to bias ongoing pro- cessing.” Goal maintenance (resembling concentration) may be especially important on inhibition tasks where it is essential to focus on task require- ments to avoid distraction or incorrect competing responses. This could explain why such tasks load only on the common factor. Support for the notion that the common factor reflects goal mainte- nance was reported by Gustavson et al. (2015). Everyday goal- management failures (assessed by questionnaire) correlated negatively with the common factor. Findings So far we have focused on the psychometric approach. The unity/ diversity framework is also supported by research using the genetic approach. Friedman et al. (2008) had monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins perform several executive function tasks. One key finding was that individual differences in all three executive functions (common; updating; shifting) were strongly influenced by genetic factors. Another key finding was that different sets of genes were associated with each function. We turn now to neuroimaging research. Such research partly supports the unity/diversity framework. Collette et al. (2005) found all three of Miyake et al.’s (2000) functions (i.e., inhibition; shifting; updating) were Figure 6.9 Schematic representation of the unity and diversity of three executive functions (EFs). Each executive function is a combination of what is common to all three and what is specific to that executive function. The inhibition-specific component is absent because the inhibition function correlates very highly with the common executive function. From Miyake and Friedman (2012).

However, all tasks produced activation in other areas (e.g., the left lateral prefrontal cortex, which is consistent with Miyake and Friedman’s (2012) unity notion). Niendam et al. (2012) carried out a meta-analysis (see Glossary) of findings from 193 studies where participants performed many tasks involv- ing executive functions. Of most importance, several brain areas were activated across all executive functions (see Figure 6.10). These areas included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9/46), fronto-polar cortex (BA10), orbitofrontal cortex (BA11) and anterior cingulate (BA32). This brain network corresponds closely to the common factor identified by Miyake and Friedman (2012). In addition, Niendam et al. found some dif- ferences in activated brain areas between shifting and inhibition function tasks. Stuss and Alexander (2007) argued the notion of a dysexecutive syn- drome (see Glossary; discussed earlier, p. 251) erroneously implies brain damage to the frontal lobes damages all central executive functions. While there may be a global dysexecutive syndrome in patients having wide- spread damage to the frontal lobes, this is not so in patients having limited prefrontal damage. Among such patients, Stuss and Alexander identified three executive processes, each associated with a different region within the frontal cortex (approximate brain locations are in brackets): (1) Task setting (left lateral): this involves planning; it is “the ability to set a stimulus-response relationship . . . necessary in the early stages of learning to drive a car or planning a wedding” (p. 906).

(3) Energisation (superior medial): this involves sustained attention or concentration; deficient energisation leads to slow performance on all tasks requiring fast responding. The above three executive processes are often used in combination when someone performs a complex task. Note that these three processes differ from those identified by Miyake et al. (2000). However, there is some overlap: task setting and monitoring both involve aspects of cognitive control as do the processes of inhibition and shifting. Stuss (2011) confirmed the importance of the above three executive functions. In addition, he identified a fourth executive process he called metacognition/integration (located in BA10: fronto-polar prefrontal cortex). According to Stuss (p. 761), “This function is integrative and coordinat- ing-orchestrating . . . [it includes] recognising the differences between what one knows from what one believes.” Evidence for this process has come from research on patients with damage to BA10 (Burgess et al., 2007). Evaluation The unity/diversity framework provides a coherent account of the major executive functions and is deservedly highly influential. One of its great- est strengths is that it is supported by research using several different approaches (e.g., psychometric; genetic; neuroimaging; neuropsycholog- ical). The notion of a hierarchical system with one very general function (common executive function) plus more specific functions (e.g., shifting; updating) is consistent with most findings. What are the limitations of the unity/diversity framework? First, as Friedman and Miyake (2017, p. 199) admitted, “The results of lesion studies are in partial agreement with the unity/diversity framework . . . the processes [identified] in these studies are not clearly the same as those [identified] in studies of normal individual differences.” For example, Stuss (2011) obtained evidence for task setting, monitoring, energisation and metacognition/integration functions in research on brain-damaged patients. Second, many neuroimaging findings appear inconsistent with the framework. For example, Nee et al. (2013) carried out a meta-analysis of 36 neuroimaging studies on executive processes. There was little evi- dence that functions such as shifting, updating and inhibition differed in their patterns of brain activation. Instead, one frontal region was mostly involved in processing spatial content (where-based processing) and a second frontal region was involved in processing non-spatial content (what-based processing). Third, Waris et al. (2017) also found evidence for content-based factors differing from the executive factors emphasised within the unity/diversity framework. They factor-analysed performance on ten working memory tasks and identified two specific content-based factors: (1) a visuo-spatial factor; and (2) a numerical-verbal factor. There is some overlap between these factors and those identified by Nee et al. (2013).

The complexities and inconsistencies of the research evi- dence suggest this assumption may be only partially correct. LEVELS OF PROCESSING (AND BEYOND) What determines long-term memory? According to Craik and Lockhart (1972), how information is processed during learning is crucial. In their levels-of-processing approach, they argued that attentional and perceptual processes of learning determine what information is stored in long-term memory. Levels of processing range from shallow or physical analysis of a stimulus (e.g., detecting specific letters in words) to deep or semantic anal- ysis. The greater the extent to which meaning is processed, the deeper the level of processing. Here are Craik and Lockhart’s (1972) main theoretical assumptions: ● The level or depth of stimulus processing has a large effect on its mem- orability: the levels-of-processing effect. ● Deeper levels of analysis produce more elaborate, longer-lasting and stronger memory traces than shallow levels. Craik (2002) subsequently moved away from the notion that there is a series of processing levels going from perceptual to semantic. Instead, he argued that the richness or elaboration of encoding is crucial for long-term memory. Hundreds of studies support the levels-of-processing approach. For example, Craik and Tulving (1975) compared deep processing (decide whether each word fits the blank in a sentence) and shallow processing (decide whether each word is in uppercase or lowercase letters). Recognition memory was more than three times higher with deep than with shallow processing. Elaboration of processing (amount of processing of a given kind) was also important. Cued recall following the deep task was twice as high for words accompanying complex sentences (e.g., “The great bird swooped down and carried off the struggling ____”) as those accompany- ing simple sentences (e.g., “She cooked the ____”). Rose et al. (2015) reported a levels-of-processing effect even with an apparently easy memory task: only a single word had to be recalled and the retention interval was only 10 seconds. More specifically, words asso- ciated with deep processing were better recalled than those associated with shallow processing when the retention interval was filled with a task involving adding or subtracting). Baddeley and Hitch (2017) pointed out the great majority of studies had used verbal materials (e.g., words). Accordingly, they decided to see whether a levels-of-processing effect would be obtained with different learn- ing materials. In one study, they found the effect with recognition memory was much smaller with doors and clocks than with food names (see Figure 6.11). The most plausible explanation is that it is harder to produce an elaborate semantic encoding with doors or clocks than with most words.

Participants answered semantic or shallow (rhyme) questions for words. Memory was tested by a standard recognition test (select list words and reject non-list words) or a rhyming recognition test (select words rhyming with list words – the list words themselves were not presented). There was the usual superiority of deep pro- cessing on the standard recognition test. However, the opposite was the case on the rhyme test, a finding inconsistent with the theory. According to Morris et al.’s transfer-appropriate processing theory, retrieval requires that the processing during learning is relevant to the demands of the memory test. With the rhyming test, rhyme information is relevant but sematic information is not. Challis et al. (1996) compared the levels-of-processing effect on explicit memory tests (e.g., recall; recognition) involving conscious recollection and on implicit memory tests not involving conscious recollection (see Chapter 7). The effect was generally greater in explicit than implicit memory. Parks (2013) explained this difference in terms of transfer-appropriate pro- cessing. Shallow processing involves more perceptual but less conceptual processing than deep processing. Accordingly, the levels-of-processing effect should generally be smaller when the memory task requires demanding perceptual processing (as is the case with most implicit memory tasks). Distinctiveness Another important factor influencing long-term memory is distinctiveness. Distinctiveness means a memory trace differs from other memory traces because it was processed differently during learning. According to Hunt and Smith (2014, p. 45), distinctive processing is “the processing of differ- ence in the context of similarity”. Eysenck and Eysenck (1980) studied distinctiveness using nouns having irregular pronunciations (e.g., comb has a silent “b”). In one condition, par- ticipants said these nouns in a distinctive way (e.g., pronouncing the “b” in comb). Thus, the processing was shallow (i.e., phonemic) but the memory traces were distinctive. Recognition memory was much higher than in a phonemic condition involving non-distinctive processing (i.e., pronouncing nouns as normal). Indeed, memory was as good with distinctive phonemic processing as with deep or semantic processing. How can we explain the beneficial effects of distinctiveness on long- term memory? Chee and Goh (2018) identified two potential explanations. First, distinctive items may attract additional attention and process- ing at the time of study. Second, distinctive items may be well remem- bered because of effects occurring at the time of retrieval, an explanation Figure 6.11 Recognition memory performance as a function of processing depth (shallow vs deep) for three types of stimuli: doors, clocks and menus.

For example, suppose the distinc- tive item is printed in red whereas all the other items are printed in black. The retrieval cue (recall the red item) uniquely specifies one item and so facilitates retrieval. Chee and Goh (2018) contrasted the two above explanations. They presented a list of words referring to species of birds including the word kiwi. Of importance, kiwi is a homograph (two words having the same spelling but two different meanings): it can mean a species of bird or a type of fruit. Participants were instructed before study (encoding condition) or after study (retrieval condition) that one of the words would be a type of fruit. The findings are shown in Figure 6.12. A distinctiveness effect was found in the retrieval condition in the absence of distinctive processing at study. These findings strongly support a retrieval-based explanation of the distinctiveness effect. Evaluation There is compelling evidence that processes at learning have a major impact on subsequent long-term memory (Roediger, 2008). Another strength of the theory is the central assumption that learning and remembering are byprod- ucts of perception, attention and comprehension. The levels-of- processing approach led to the identification of elaboration and distinctiveness of processing as important factors in learning and memory. Finally, “The levels-of-processing approach has been fruitful and generative, providing a powerful set of experimental techniques for exploring the phenomena of memory” (Roediger & Gallo, 2001, p. 44). The levels-of-processing approach has several limitations. First, Craik and Lockhart (1972) underestimated the importance of the retrieval envi- ronment in determining memory performance (e.g., Morris et al., 1977). Second, the relative importance of processing depth, elaboration of process- ing and distinctiveness of processing to long-term memory remains unclear. Third, the terms “depth”, “elaboration” and “distinctiveness” are vague and hard to measure (Roediger & Gallo, 2001).

Fifth, the levels-of-processing effect is typically smaller with non-verbal stimuli than with words (Baddeley & Hitch, 2017). LEARNING THROUGH RETRIEVAL How can we maximise our learning (e.g., of some topic in cognitive psy- chology)? Many people (including you?) think what is required is to study and re-study the to-be-learned material with testing serving only to estab- lish what has been learned. In fact, this is not the case. As we will see, there is typically a testing effect: “the finding that intermediate retrieval practice between study and a final memory test can dramatically enhance final-test performance when compared with restudy trials” (Kliegl & Bäuml, 2016). The testing effect is generally surprisingly strong. Dunlosky et al. (2013) discussed ten learning techniques including writing summaries, forming images of texts and generating explanations for stated facts, and found repeated testing was the most effective technique. Rowland (2014) carried out a meta-analysis: 81% of the findings were positive. Most of these studies were laboratory-based. Reassuringly, Schwieren et al. (2017) found the magnitude of the testing effect was comparable in real-life contexts (teaching psychology) and laboratory conditions. Explanations of the testing effect We start by identifying two important theoretical approaches to explaining the testing effect. First, several theorists have emphasised the importance of retrieval effort (Rowland, 2014). The core notion here is that the testing effect will be greater when the difficulty or effort involved in retrieval during the learning period is high rather than low. Why does increased retrieval effort have this beneficial effect? Several answers have been suggested. For example, there is the elaborative retrieval hypothesis, which is applicable to paired-associate learning (e.g., learn- ing to associate the cue Chalk with the target Crayon). According to this hypothesis, “the act of retrieving a target from a cue activates cue- relevant information that becomes incorporated with the successfully retrieved target, providing a more elaborate representation” (Carpenter & Yeung, 2017, p. 129). According to a more specific version of this hypothesis (the mediator effectiveness hypothesis), retrieval practice promotes the use of more effective mediators. In the above example, Board might be a mediator triggered by the cue Chalk. Rickard and Pan (2018) proposed a related (but more general) dual-memory theory. In essence, restudy causes the memory trace formed at initial study to be strengthened. Testing with feedback (which involves effort) also strengthens the memory trace formed at initial study. More importantly, it leads to the formation of a second memory trace (see Figure 6.13). The strength of this second memory trace probably depends on the amount of retrieval effort during testing. Thus, testing generally pro- motes superior memory to restudy because it promotes the acquisition of two memory traces for each item rather than one.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\n266 Memory Second, there is the bifurcation model (bifurcation means division into two) proposed by Kornell et al. (2011). According to this model, items successfully retrieved during testing practice are strengthened more than restudied items. However, the crucial assumption is that items not retrieved during testing practice are strengthened less than restudied items; indeed, their memory strength does not change. Thus, there should be circumstances in which the testing effect is reversed. Findings Several findings indicate that the size of the testing effect depends on retrieval effort (probably because it leads to the formation of a strong second memory trace). Endres and Renkl (2015) asked participants to rate the mental effort they used during retrieval practice and restudying. They obtained a testing effect that disappeared when mental effort was controlled for statistically. As predicted, more effortful or difficult retrieval tests (e.g., free recall) typically led to a greater testing effect than easy retrieval tests (e.g., recognition memory) (Rowland, 2014). All these findings provide indirect support for the dual-memory theory. It seems reasonable to assume retrieval practice is more effortful and demanding when initial memory performance is low rather than high. As Figure 6.13 (a) Restudy causes strengthening of the memory trace formed after initial study; (b) testing with feedback causes strengthening of the original memory trace; and (c) the formation of a second memory trace. t = the response threshold that must be exceeded for any given item to be retrieved on the final test.

Suppose you are trying to learn the word pair wingu–cloud. You might try to link the words by using the mediator plane. When subsequently given the cue (wingu) and told to recall the target word (cloud), you might generate the sequence wingu–wing–cloud according to the mediator effec- tiveness hypothesis. Pyc and Rawson (2010) instructed participants to learn Swahili-English pairs (e.g., wingu–cloud). In one condition, each trial after the initial study trial involved only restudy. In the other con- dition (test-restudy), each trial after the initial study trial involved a cued recall test followed by restudy. Participants generated and reported medi- ators on the study and restudy trials. There were three recall conditions on the final memory test 1 week later: (1) cue only; (2) cue + the medi- ator generated during learning; (3) cue + prompt to try to generate the mediator. The findings were straightforward (see Figure 6.14(a)): (1) Memory performance in the cue only condition replicated the basic testing effect. (2) Performance in the cue + mediator con- dition shows test-restudy participants generated more effective mediators than restudy-only participants. (3) Test-restudy participants performed much better than restudy-only ones in the cue + prompt condition. Test- restudy participants remembered the mediators much better. Retrieving mediators was important for the test- restudy participants – their performance was poor when they failed to recall mediators. Pyc and Rawson (2012) developed the medi- ator effectiveness hypothesis. Participants were more likely to change their mediators during test-restudy practice than restudy-only practice. Of most importance, participants engaged in test-restudy practice were more likely to change their mediators following retrieval failure than retrieval success. Thus, retrieval practice allows people to evaluate the effectiveness of their mediators and to replace ineffective ones with effective ones. We turn now to the bifurcation model, the main theoretical approach predicting reversals of the testing effect. Support was Figure 6.14 (a) Final recall for restudy-only and test-restudy group participants provided at test with cues (C), cues + the mediators generated during learning (CM) or cues plus prompts to recall their mediators (CMR).

In Session 2 (48 hours later), Test 1 was immediately followed by feedback (re-presentation of the word pairs) and 10 minutes later by Test 2. There was a testing effect on Test 1 but a reversed testing effect on Test 2 (see Figure 6.15). According to the bifurcation model, non-recalled items on Test 1 should be weaker if previously subject to retrieval practice rather than restudy. Thus, they should benefit less from feedback. That is precisely what happened (see Figure 6.15). Most research on the testing effect has involved the use of identical materials during both initial and final retrieval tests. For many purposes, however, we want retrieval to produce more general and flexible learning that transfers to related (but non-tested) information. Pan and Rickard (2018) found in a meta-analysis that retrieval practice on average has a moderately beneficial effect on transfer of learning. This was especially the case when retrieval practice involved elaborative feedback (e.g., extended and detailed feedback) than when only basic feedback (i.e., the correct answer) was provided. Evaluation The testing effect is strong and has been obtained with many different types of learning materials. Testing during learning has the advantage it can be used almost regardless of the nature of the to-be-learned material. Of importance, retrieval practice often produces learning that generalises or transfers to related (but non-tested) information. Testing has benefi- cial effects because it produces a more elaborate memory trace (elabora- tive retrieval hypothesis) or a second memory trace (dual-memory theory). However, testing can be ineffective if the studied material is not retrieved and there is no feedback (the bifurcation model). What are the limitations of theory and research in this area? (1) There are several ways retrieval practice might produce more elabo- rate memory traces (e.g., additional processing of external context; the production of more effective internal mediators). The precise form of such elaborate memory traces is hard to predict. (2) The dual-memory theory provides a powerful explanation of the testing effect. However, more research is required to demonstrate the conditions in which testing leads to the formation of a second memory trace differing from the memory trace formed during initial study. (3) The bifurcation model has received empirical support. However, it does not specify the underlying processes or mechanisms responsible for the reversed testing effect.

(4) The fact that the testing effect has been found with numerous types of learning material and testing conditions suggests that many different processes can produce that effect. Thus, currently prominent theories are probably applicable to only some findings. IMPLICIT LEARNING Earlier in the chapter we discussed learning through retrieval and learn- ing from the levels-of-processing perspective. In both cases, the empha- sis was on explicit learning: it generally makes substantial demands on attention and working memory and learners are aware of what they are learning. Can we learn something without an awareness of what we have learned? It sounds improbable. Even if we learned something without realising, it seems unlikely we would make much use of it. In fact, there is much evi- dence for implicit learning: “learning that occurs without full conscious awareness of the regularities contained in the learning material itself and/ or that learning has occurred” (Sævland & Norman, 2016, p. 1). As we will see, it is often assumed implicit learning differs from explicit learning in being less reliant on attention and working memory. We can also distinguish between implicit learning and implicit memory (memory not involving conscious recollection; discussed in Chapter 7). There can be implicit memory for information acquired through explicit learn- ing if learners lose awareness of that information over time. There can also be explicit memory for information acquired through implicit learn- ing if learners are provided with informative contextual cues when trying to remember that information. However, implicit learning is typically fol- lowed by implicit memory whereas explicit learning is followed by explicit memory. There is an important difference between research on implicit learning and implicit memory. Research on implicit learning mostly involves focus- ing on performance changes occurring over a lengthy sequence of learning trials. In contrast, research on implicit memory mostly involves one or a few learning trials and the emphasis is on the effects of various factors (e.g., retention interval; retrieval cues) on memory performance. In addi- tion, research on implicit learning often uses fairly complex, novel tasks whereas much research on implicit memory uses simple, familiar stimulus materials. Reber (1993) made five assumptions concerning major differences between implicit and explicit learning (none established definitively): (1) Age independence: implicit learning is little influenced by age or devel- opmental level. (2) IQ independence: performance on implicit tasks is relatively unaffected by IQ. (3) Robustness: implicit systems are relatively unaffected by disorders (e.g., amnesia) affecting explicit systems. (4) Low variability: there are smaller individual differences in implicit learning than explicit learning. (5) Commonality of process: implicit systems are common to most species.

With respect to the first assump- tion, some studies have reported comparable implicit learning in older and young adults. However, implicit learning is mostly significantly impaired in older adults. How can we explain this deficit? Older adults generally have reduced volume of frontal cortex and the striatum, an area strongly associ- ated with implicit learning (King et al., 2013a). With respect to the second assumption, Christou et al. (2016) found on a visuo-motor task that the positive effects of high working memory capacity on task performance were due to explicit but not implicit learn- ing. When the visuo-motor task was changed to reduce the possibility of explicit learning, high working memory capacity was unrelated to perfor- mance. Overall, intelligence is associated more strongly with explicit learn- ing. However, the association between intelligence and implicit learning appears greater than predicted by Reber (1993). IN THE REAL WORLD: SKILLED TYPISTS AND IMPLICIT LEARNING Millions of individuals have highly developed typing skills (e.g., the typical American student who touch types produces 70 words a minute) (Logan & Crump, 2009). Nevertheless, many expert typists find it hard to think exactly where the letters are on the keyboard. For example, the first author of this book has typed 8 million words for publication but has limited conscious awareness of the locations of most letters! This suggests expert typing relies heavily on implicit learning and memory. However, typing initially involves mostly explicit learning as typists learn to associate finger movements with specific letter keys. Snyder et al. (2014) studied college students averaging 11.4 years of typing practice. In the first experiment, typists saw a blank keyboard and were instructed to write the letters in their correct locations (see Figure 6.16). They located only 14.9 (57.3%) of the letters accurately. If you are a skilled typist, try this task before checking your answers (shown in Figure 6.22). Accurate identification of letters’ keyboard locations could occur because typists engage in simulated typing. In their second experiment, Snyder et al. (2014) found the ability to identify the keyboard locations of letters was reduced when simulated typing was prevented. Thus, explicit memory for letter locations is lower than 57%.

(2014) gave typists two hours’ training on the Dvorak keyboard, on which the letter locations differ from the traditional QWERTY keyboard. The ability to locate letters on the Dvorak and QWERTY keyboards was comparable. Thus, typists have no more explicit knowledge of letter locations on a keyboard after 11 years than after 2 hours! What is the nature of experienced typists’ implicit learning? Logan (2018) addressed this issue. Much of this learning involves forming associations between individual letters and finger movements. In addition, however, typists learn to treat each word as a single chunk or unit. As a result, they type words much faster than non-words containing the same number of letters. Thus, implicit learning occurs at both the word and letter levels (Logan, 2018). If experts rely on implicit learning and memory, we might predict performance impairments if they focused consciously on their actions. There is much support for this prediction. For example, Flegal and Anderson (2008) gave skilled golfers a putting task before and after they described their actions in detail. Their putting performance was markedly worse after describing their actions because conscious processes disrupted implicit ones. Assessing implicit learning You might think it is easy to decide whether implicit learning has occurred – we simply ask participants after performing a task to indicate their con- scious awareness of their learning. Implicit learning is shown if there is no such conscious awareness. Alas, individuals sometimes fail to report fully their conscious aware- ness of their learning (Shanks, 2010). For example, there is the “retrospec- tive problem” (Shanks & St. John, 1994) – participants may be consciously aware of what they are learning at the time but have forgotten it when questioned subsequently. Shanks and St. John (1994) proposed two criteria (incompletely imple- mented in most research) for implicit learning to be demonstrated: (1) Information criterion: The information participants are asked to provide on the awareness test must be the information responsible for the improved performance. (2) Sensitivity criterion: “We must . . . show our test of awareness is sen- sitive to all of the relevant knowledge” (Shanks & St. John, 1994, p. 374). We may underestimate participants’ consciously accessible knowledge if we use an insensitive awareness test. When implicit learning studies fail to obtain significant evidence of explicit learning, researchers often (mistakenly) conclude there was no explicit learning. Consider research on contextual cueing: participants search for targets in visual displays and targets are detected increasingly rapidly (espe- cially with repeated rather than random displays). Subsequently, partici- pants see the repeating patterns and new random ones and indicate whether they have previously seen each one. Typically, participants fail to identify the repeating patterns significantly more often than the random ones. Such non-significant findings imply all task learning is implicit. Vadillo et al. (2016) argued many of the above non-significant find- ings occurred because insufficiently large samples were used. In their review of 73 studies, 78.5% of awareness tests produced non-significant findings. Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":[".","(2014)."]}

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\n272 Memory Nevertheless, participants in 67% of the studies performed above chance (a highly significant finding). Thus, some explicit learning is involved in contextual cueing even though the opposite is often claimed. Finally, we consider the process-dissociation procedure. Suppose participants perform a task involving a repeating sequence of stimuli. They either guess the next stimulus (inclusion condition) or try to avoid guess- ing the next stimulus accurately (exclusion condition). If learning is wholly implicit, performance should be comparable in both conditions because participants would have no conscious access to relevant information. If it is partly or wholly explicit, performance should be better in the inclusion condition. The process-dissociation procedure is based on the assumption that the influence of implicit and explicit processes is unaffected by instruc- tions (inclusion vs exclusion). However, Barth et al. (2019) found explicit knowledge was less likely to influence performance in the exclusion than the inclusion condition. Such findings make it hard to interpret findings obtained using the process-dissociation procedure. Findings The serial reaction time task has often been used to study implicit learn- ing. On each trial, a stimulus appears at one of several locations on a com- puter screen and participants respond using the response key corresponding to its location. There is typically a complex, repeating sequence over trials but participants are not told this. Towards the end of the experiment, there is often a block of trials conforming to a novel sequence but the partici- pants are not informed. Participants speed up over trials on the serial reaction time task but respond much more slowly during the novel sequence (Shanks, 2010). When questioned at the end of the experiment, participants usually claim no conscious awareness of a repeating sequence or pattern. However, par- ticipants sometimes have partial awareness of what they have learned. Wilkinson and Shanks (2004) gave participants 1,500 trials (15 blocks) or 4,500 trials (45 blocks) on the task and obtained strong sequence learn- ing. This was followed by a test of explicit learning based on the process- dissociation procedure. Participants’ predictions were significantly better in the inclusion than exclusion condition (see Figure 6.17) indicating some conscious or explicit knowledge was acquired. In a similar study, Gaillard et al. (2009) obtained comparable findings and discovered conscious knowledge increased with practice. Haider et al. (2011) argued the best way to assess whether learning is explicit or implicit is to use several measures of conscious awareness. They used a version of the serial reaction time task in which a colour word (the target) was written in ink of the same colour (congruent trials) or a differ- ent colour (incongruent trials). Participants responded to the colour word rather than the ink. There were six different coloured squares below the target word and participants pressed the coloured square corresponding to the colour word. The correct coloured square followed a regular sequence (1-6-4-2-3-5) but participants were not told this. KEY TERMS Process-dissociation procedure On learning tasks, participants try to guess the next stimulus (inclusion condition) or avoid guessing the next stimulus accurately (exclusion condition); the difference between the two conditions indicates the amount of explicit learning. Serial reaction time task Participants on this task respond as rapidly as possible to stimuli typically presented in a repeating sequence; it is used to assess implicit learning.

They hypothesised these RT-drop participants were consciously aware of the regular sequence (explicit learning). The remaining 66% failed to show a sudden drop (the no-RT-drop participants) and were hypothesised to have engaged only in implicit learning (see Figure 6.18). Haider et al. (2011) used the process- dissociation procedure to test the above hypotheses. The RT-drop participants per- formed well: 80% correct on inclusion trials vs 18% correct on exclusion trials, suggesting considerable explicit learning. In contrast, the no-RT-drop participants had comparably low performance on inclusion and exclusion trials indicating an absence of explicit learn- ing. Finally, all participants described the training sequence (explicit task). Almost all (91%) of the RT-drop participants did this perfectly compared to 0% of the no-RT-drop participants. Thus, all the various findings supported Haider et al.’s hypotheses. Figure 6.18 Response times for participants showing a sudden drop in RTs (right-hand side) or not showing such a drop (left-hand side).

As predicted, Jiménez and Vázquez (2011) reported no interference when participants performed the serial reaction time task and a second implicit learning task. Many tasks involve a combination of implicit and explicit learning. Taylor et al. (2014) used a visuo-motor adaptation task on which partic- ipants learned to point at a target that rotated 45 degrees counterclock- wise. Participants initially indicated their aiming direction and then made a rapid reaching movement. The former provided a measure of explicit learning whereas the latter provided a measure of implicit learning. Thus, an advantage of this experimental approach is that it provides separate measures of explicit and implicit learning. Huberdeau et al. (2015) reviewed findings using the above visuo-motor adaptation task and drew two main conclusions. First, improved perfor- mance over trials depended on both implicit and explicit learning. Second, there was a progressive increase in implicit learning with practice, whereas most explicit learning occurred early in practice. Cognitive neuroscience If implicit and explicit learning are genuinely different, they should be asso- ciated with different brain areas. Implicit learning has been linked to the striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia (see Figure 6.19). For example, Reiss et al. (2005) found on the serial reaction time task that participants showing implicit learning had greater activation in the striatum than those not exhibiting implicit learning. In contrast, explicit learning and memory are typically associated with activation in the medial temporal lobes including the hippocam- pus (see Chapter 7). Since conscious awareness is most consistently associated with activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate (see Chapter 16), these areas should be more active during explicit than implicit learning. Relevant evidence was reported by Wessel et al. (2012) using the serial reaction time task. Some participants showed clear evi- dence of explicit learning during training. A brain area centred on the right prefrontal cortex became much more active around the onset of explicit learning. In similar fashion, Lawson et al. (2017) compared participants showing (or not showing) conscious aware- ness of a repeating pattern on the serial reac- tion time task. The fronto-parietal network was more activated for those showing conscious awareness.

Destrebecqz et al. (2005) used the process-dissociation procedure (see Glossary) with the serial reaction time task to distinguish more clearly between the explicit and implicit components of learning. Striatum acti- vation was associated with the implicit component whereas the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate were associated with the explicit component. Penhune and Steele (2012) proposed a model of motor sequence learning (see Figure 6.20). The striatum is involved in learning stimulus– response associations and motor chunking or organisation. The cerebellum is involved in producing an internal model to aid sequence performance and error correction. Finally, the motor cortex is involved in storing the learned motor sequence. Of importance, the involvement of each brain area varies across stages of learning. Evidence for the importance of the cerebellum in motor sequence learning was reported by Shimizu et al. (2017) using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; see Glossary) applied to the cerebellum. This KEY TERM Striatum It forms part of the basal ganglia and is located in the upper part of the brainstem and the inferior part of the cerebral hemispheres.

In spite of the above findings, there are many inconsistencies and com- plexities in the research literature (Reber, 2013). For example, Gheysen et al. (2011) found the striatum contributed to explicit learning of motor sequences as well as implicit learning and the hippocampus is sometimes involved in implicit learning (Henke, 2010). Why are the findings inconsistent? First, there are numerous forms of implicit learning. As Reber (2013, p. 2029) argued, “We should expect to find implicit learning . . . whenever perception and/or actions are repeated so that processing comes to reflect the statistical structure of experience.” As a consequence, it is probable that implicit learning can involve several different brain networks. Second, we can regard, “the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cortex as an integrated system” (Caligiore et al., 2017, p. 204). This system plays an important role in implicit and explicit learning. Third, as we have seen, there are large individual differences in learn- ing strategies and the balance between implicit and explicit learning. These individual differences introduce complexity into the overall findings. Fourth, there are often changes in the involvement of implicit and explicit processes during learning. For example, Beukema and Verstynen (2018) focused on changes in the involvement of different brain regions during the acquisition of sequential motor skills (e.g., the skills acquired by typists). Explicit processes dependent on the medial temporal lobe (shown in magenta) were especially important early in learning whereas implicit processes dependent on the basal ganglia (shown in blue) became increas- ingly important later in learning (see Figure 6.21). Figure 6.21 Sequential motor skill learning initially depends on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) including the hippocampus (shown in magenta) but subsequently depends more on the basal ganglia (BG) including the striatum (shown in blue).

If separate learning systems underlie implicit and explicit learning, we might expect amnesic patients to have intact implicit learning but impaired explicit learning. That pattern of findings has been reported several times. However, amnesic patients are often slower than healthy controls on implicit-learning tasks (Oudman et al., 2015). Earlier we discussed the hypothesis that the basal ganglia (especially the striatum) are of major importance in implicit learning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (a progressive neurological disorder) have damage to this region. As predicted, Clark et al. (2014) found in a meta-analytic review that patients with Parkinson’s disease typically exhibit impaired implicit learning on the serial reaction time task (see Chapter 7). However, Wilkinson et al. (2009) found Parkinson’s patients also showed impaired explicit learning on that task. In a review, Marinelli et al. (2017) found that Parkinson’s patients showed the greatest impairment in motor learn- ing when the task required conscious processing resources (e.g., attention; cognitive strategies). Much additional research indicates Parkinson’s patients have impaired conscious processing (see Chapter 7). Siegert et al. (2008) found in a meta- analytic review that such patients exhibited consistently poorer performance than healthy controls on working memory tasks. Roussel et al. (2017) found 80% of Parkinson’s patients have dysexecutive syndrome which involves general impairments in cognitive processing. In sum, findings from Parkinson’s patients provide only limited information concerning the dis- tinction between implicit and explicit learning. Evaluation Research on implicit learning has several strengths (see also Chapter 7). First, the distinction between implicit and explicit learning has received Figure 6.22 Percentages of experienced typists given an unfilled schematic keyboard (see Figure 6.16) who correctly located (top number), omitted (middle number) or misplaced (bottom number) each letter with respect to the standard keyboard.

Second, the basal ganglia (including the striatum) tend to be associated with implicit learning whereas the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and medial temporal lobes are associated with explicit learning. There is accu- mulating evidence that complex brain networks are involved in implicit learning (e.g., Penhune & Steele, 2012). Third, given the deficiencies in assessing conscious awareness with any single measure, researchers are increasingly using several measures. Thankfully, different measures often provide comparable estimates of the extent of conscious awareness (e.g., Haider et al., 2011). Fourth, researchers increasingly reject the erroneous assumption that finding some evidence of explicit learning implies no implicit learning occurred. In fact, learning typically involves implicit and explicit aspects and the extent to which learners are consciously aware of what they are learning depends on individual differences and the stage of learning (e.g., Wessel et al., 2012). What are the limitations of research on implicit learning? (1) There is often a complex mixture of implicit and explicit learning, making it hard to determine the extent of implicit learning. (2) The processes underlying implicit and explicit learning interact in ways that remain unclear. (3) In order to show the existence of implicit learning we need to demon- strate that learning has occurred in the absence of conscious aware- ness. This is hard to do – we may fail to assess fully participants’ conscious awareness (Shanks, 2017). (4) The definition of implicit learning as learning occurring without con- scious awareness is vague and underspecified, and so is applicable to numerous forms of learning having little in common with each other. It is probable that no current theory can account for the diverse forms of implicit learning. FORGETTING FROM LONG-TERM MEMORY Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913) studied forgetting from long-term memory in detail, using himself as the only participant (not recommended!). He initially learned lists of nonsense syllables lacking meaning and then relearned each list between 21 minutes and 31 days later. His basic measure of forgetting was the savings method – the reduction in the number of trials during relearning compared to original learning. Ebbinghaus found forgetting was very rapid over the first hour after learning but then slowed considerably (see Figure 6.23). Rubin and Wenzel (1996) found the same pattern when analysing numerous for- getting functions and argued a logarithmic function describes forgetting over time. In contrast, Averell and Heathcote (2011) argued for a power function. It is often assumed (mistakenly) that forgetting should always be avoided. Nørby (2015) identified three major functions served by forgetting: KEY TERM Savings method A measure of forgetting introduced by Ebbinghaus in which the number of trials for relearning is compared against the number for original learning.

(2) It is useful to forget outdated information (e.g., where your friends used to live) so it does not interfere with current information (e.g., where your friends live now). Richards and Frankland (2017) devel- oped this argument. They argued a major purpose of memory is to enhance decision-making and this purpose is facilitated when we forget outdated information. (3) When trying to remember what we have read or heard, it is typically most useful to forget specific details and focus on the overall gist or message (see Box and Chapter 10). Figure 6.23 Forgetting over time as indexed by reduced savings. Data from Ebbinghaus (1885/1913). IN THE REAL WORLD: IS PERFECT MEMORY USEFUL? What would it be like to have a perfect memory? Jorge Luis Borges (1964) answered this question in a story called “Funes the memorious”. After falling from a horse, Funes remembers everything that happens to him in full detail. This had several negative consequences. When he recalled the events of any given day, it took him an entire day to do so! He found it very hard to think because his mind was full of incredibly detailed information. Here is an example: Not only was it difficult for him to comprehend that the generic symbol dog embraces so many unlike individuals of diverse size and form; it bothered him that the dog at three fourteen (seen from the side) should have the same name as the dog at three fifteen (seen from the front).

When he worked as a journalist, his editor noticed he could repeat everything said to him verbatim. The editor sent Shereshevskii (S) to see the psychologist Luria. He found S rapidly learned complex material (e.g., lists of over 100 digits) which he remembered perfectly (even in reverse order) several years later. According to Luria (1968), “There was no limit either to the capacity of S’s memory or to the durability of the traces he retained.” What was S’s secret? He had exceptional imagery and an amazing capacity for synaesthesia (the tendency for processing in one modality to evoke other sense modalities). For example, when hearing a tone, he said: “It looks like fireworks tinged with a pink-red hue.” Do you envy S’s memory powers? Ironically, his memory was so good it disrupted his everyday life. For example, this was his experience when hearing a prose passage: “Each word calls up images, they collide with one another, and the result is chaos.” His mind came to resemble “a junk heap of impressions”. His acute awareness of details meant he sometimes failed to recognise someone he knew if, for example, their facial colouring had altered because they had been on holiday. These memory limitations made it hard for him to live a normal life and he eventually ended up in an asylum. KEY TERM Synaesthesia The tendency for one sense modality to evoke another. Most forgetting studies focus on declarative or explicit memory involv- ing conscious recollection (see Chapter 7). Forgetting is often slower in implicit than explicit memory. For example, Mitchell (2006) asked participants to identify pictures from fragments having seen some of them in an experiment 17 years pre- viously. Performance was better with the previously seen pictures, provid- ing evidence for very-long-term implicit memory. However, there was little explicit memory for the previous experiment. A 36-year-old male partici- pant confessed, “I’m sorry – I don’t really remember this experiment at all.” Below we discuss major theories of forgetting. These theories are not mutually exclusive – they all identify factors jointly responsible for forgetting. Decay Perhaps the simplest explanation for forgetting of long-term memories is decay, which involves “forgetting due to a gradual loss of the substrate of memory” (Hardt et al., 2013, p. 111). More specifically, forgetting often occurs because of decay processes occurring within memory traces. In spite of its plausibility, decay has largely been ignored as an explanation of for- getting. Hardt et al. argued a decay process (operating mostly during sleep) removes numerous trivial memories we form every day. This decay process is especially active in the hippocampus (part of the medial temporal lobe involved in acquiring new memories; see Chapter 7). Forgetting can be due to decay or interference (discussed shortly). Sadeh et al. (2016) assumed detailed memories (i.e., containing contextual information) are sufficiently complex to be relatively immune to interference Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["have the same name as the dog at three fifteen (seen from the front).","(p."]}

As a result, most forgetting of such memories should be due to decay. In contrast, weak memories (i.e., lacking contextual infor- mation) are very susceptible to interference and so forgetting of such memo- ries should be primarily due to interference rather than decay. Sadeh et al.’s findings supported these assumptions. Thus, the role played by decay in forgetting depends on the nature of the underlying memory traces. Interference theory Interference theory was the dominant approach to forgetting during much of the twentieth century. According to this theory, long-term memory is impaired by two forms of interference: (1) proactive interference – disruption of memory by previous learning; (2) retroactive interference – disruption of memory for previous by other learning or processing during the retention interval. Research using methods such as those shown in Figure 6.22 indicates proactive and retroactive interference are both maximal when two different responses are associated with the same stimulus. Proactive interference Proactive interference typically involves competition between the correct response and an incorrect one. There is greater competition (and thus more interference) when the incorrect response is associated with the same stimu- lus as the correct response. Jacoby et al. (2001) found proactive interference was due much more to the strength of the incorrect response than the weak- ness of the correct response. Thus, it is hard to exclude incorrect responses from the retrieval process. More evidence for the importance of retrieval processes was reported by Bäuml and Kliegl (2013). They tested the hypothesis that proactive interference is often found because rememberers’ memory search is too KEY TERMS Proactive interference Disruption of memory by previous learning (often of similar material). Retroactive interference Disruption of memory for previously learned information by other learning or processing occurring during the retention interval.

In the remember (proactive interference) condition, three word lists were presented followed by free recall of the last one. In the forget condition, the same lists were presented but participants were told after the first two lists to forget them. Finally, there was a control (no proactive interference) condition where only one list was learned and tested. Participants in the control condition recalled 68% of the words compared to only 41% in the proactive interference condition. Crucially, participants in the forget condi- tion recalled 68% of the words despite having learned two previous lists. The instruction to forget the first two lists allowed participants to limit their retrieval efforts to the third list. This interpretation was strengthened by the finding that retrieval speed was comparable in the forget and control conditions (see Figure 6.25). Kliegl et al. (2015) found in a similar study that impaired encoding (see Glossary) contributes to proactive inter- ference. Encoding was assessed using electroencephalography (EEG; see Glossary). The EEG indicated there was reduced attention during encoding of a word list preceded by other word lists (proactive interference condi- tion). As in the study by Bäuml and Kliegl (2013), there was also evidence that proactive interference impaired retrieval. Suppose participants learn word pairs on the first list (e.g., Cat–Dirt) and more word pairs on the second list (e.g., Cat–Tree). They are then given the first words (e.g., Cat) and must recall the paired word from the second list (see Figure 6.24). Jacoby et al. (2015) argued proactive interference (e.g., recalling Dirt instead of Tree) often occurs when participants often fail to recog- nise changes in the word pairings between lists. As predicted, when they instructed some participants to detect changed pairs, there was proactive facilitation rather than interference. Thus, proactive interference can be reduced (or even reversed) if we recollect the changes between information learned originally and subsequently. Retroactive interference Anecdotal evidence that retroactive interference can be important in every- day life comes from travellers claiming exposure to a foreign language reduces their ability to recall words in their own language. Misra et al. (2012) studied bilinguals whose native language was Chinese and second language was English. They named pictures in Chinese more slowly after previously naming the same pictures in English. The evidence from event- related potentials suggested participants were inhibiting second- language names when naming pictures in Chinese.

(2015) found evidence for proactive facilitation rather than interference when participants explicitly focused on changes between the first and second lists (e.g., Cat–Dirt and Cat–Tree). Jacoby et al. also found that instructing participants to focus on changes between lists produced retroactive facilitation rather than interference. Focusing on changes made it easier for participants to discriminate accu- rately between list 1 responses (e.g., Dirt) and list 2 responses (e.g., Tree). Retroactive interference is generally greatest when the new learning resembles previous learning. However, Dewar et al. (2007) obtained evi- dence of retroactive interference for a word list when participants per- formed an unrelated task (e.g., detecting tones) between learning and memory test. Fatania and Mercer (2017) found children were more sus- ceptible than adults to non-specific retroactive interference, perhaps because they used fewer effective strategies (e.g., rehearsal) to minimise such interference. In sum, retroactive interference can occur in two ways: (1) learning material similar to the original learning material; (2) distraction involving expenditure of mental effort during the retention interval (non-specific retroactive interference); this cause of retroac- tive interference is probably most common in everyday life. Retrieval problems play a major role in producing retroactive interference. Lustig et al. (2004) found that much retroactive interference occurs because people find it hard to avoid retrieving information from the wrong list. How can we reduce retrieval problems? Unsworth et al. (2013) obtained substan- tial retroactive interference when two word lists were presented prior to recall of the first list. When focused retrieval was made easier (the words in each list belonged to two separate categories such as animals and trees), there was no retroactive interference. Ecker et al. (2015) also tested recall of the first list following presenta- tion of two word lists. When the time interval between lists was long rather than short, recall performance was better. Focusing retrieval on first-list words was easier when the two lists were more separated in time and thus more discriminable. Evaluation There is convincing evidence for both proactive and retroactive interfer- ence, and progress has been made in identifying the underlying processes. Proactive and retroactive interference depend in part on problems with focusing retrieval exclusively on to-be-remembered information. Proactive interference also depends on impaired encoding of information. Both types of interference can be reduced by active strategies (e.g., focusing on changes between the two lists). What are the limitations of theory and research in this area? First, interference theory explains why forgetting occurs but does not explain why forgetting rate decreases over time. Second, we need clarification of the roles of impaired encoding and impaired retrieval in producing inter- ference effects.

Third, the precise mechanisms responsible for the reduced interference effects with various strategies have not been identified. Motivated forgetting Interest in motivated forgetting was triggered by the bearded Austrian psy- chologist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). His approach was narrowly focused on repressed traumatic and other distressing memories. More recently, a broader approach to motivated forgetting has been adopted. Much infor- mation in long-term memory is outdated and useless for present purposes (e.g., where you have previously parked your car). Thus, motivated or intentional forgetting can be adaptive. Repression Freud claimed threatening or traumatic memories often cannot gain access to conscious awareness: this serves to reduce anxiety. He used the term repression to refer to this phenomenon. He claimed childhood traumatic memories forgotten for many years are sometimes remembered in adult life. Freud found these recovered memories were often recalled during therapy. However, many experts (e.g., Loftus & Davis, 2006) argue most recovered memories are false memories referring to imaginary events. Relevant evidence concerning the truth of recovered memories was reported by Lief and Fetkewicz (1995). Of adult patients who admitted reporting false recovered memories, 80% had therapists who had made direct suggestions they had been subject to childhood sexual abuse. These findings suggest recovered memories recalled inside therapy are more likely to be false than those recalled outside. Geraerts et al. (2007) obtained support for the above suggestion in a study on three adult groups who had suffered childhood sexual abuse: (1) Suggestive therapy group: their recovered memories were recalled ini- tially inside therapy. (2) Spontaneous recovery group: their recovered memories were recalled initially outside therapy. (3) Continuous memory group: they had continuous memories of abuse from childhood onwards. Geraerts et al. (2007) argued the genuineness of the memories produced could be assessed approximately by using corroborating evidence (e.g., the abuser had confessed). Such evidence was available for 45% of the continu- ous memory group and 37% of the outside therapy group but for 0% of the inside therapy group. These findings suggest recovered memories recalled outside therapy are much more likely to be genuine than those recalled inside therapy. Geraerts (2012) reviewed research comparing women whose recov- ered memories were recalled spontaneously or in therapy. Of importance, those with spontaneous recovered memories showed more ability to sup- press unwanted memories and were more likely to forget they remembered KEY TERMS Repression Motivated forgetting of traumatic or other threatening events (especially from childhood).

Spontaneous recovery memories are often triggered by relevant retrieval cues (e.g., returning to the scene of the abuse). It seems surprising that women recovering memories outside therapy failed for many years to remember childhood sexual abuse. However, it is so only if the memories are traumatic (as Freud assumed). In fact, only 8% of women with recovered memories regarded the relevant events as trau- matic or sexual when they occurred (Clancy & McNally, 2005/2006). The great majority described their memories as confusing or uncomfortable – it seems reasonable that confusing or uncomfortable memories could be suppressed or simply ignored or forgotten. In sum, many assumptions about recovered memories are false. As McNally and Geraerts (2009, p. 132) concluded, “A genuine recovered CSA [childhood sexual abuse] memory does not require repression, trauma, or even complete forgetting.” Directed forgetting Directed forgetting is a phenomenon involving impaired long-term memory triggered by instructions to forget information previously pre- sented for learning. It is often studied using the item method: several words are presented, each followed immediately by an instruction to remem- ber or forget it. After the words have been presented, participants are tested for recall or recognition memory of all the words. Memory perfor- mance is worse for the to-be-forgotten words than the to-be-remembered ones. What causes directed forgetting? The instructions cause learners to direct their rehearsal processes to to-be-remembered items at the expense of to-be-forgotten ones. Inhibitory processes are also involved. Successful forgetting is associated with activation in areas within the right frontal cortex involved in inhibition (Rizio & Dennis, 2013). Directed forgetting is often unsuccessful. Rizio and Dennis (2017) found 60% of items associated with forget instructions (Forget items) were successfully recognised compared to 73% for items associated with remem- ber instructions (Remember items). They then considered brain activation for successfully recognised items associated with a feeling of remembering. There was greater activation in prefrontal areas associated with effortful processing for recognised Forget items than recognised Remember items. This enhanced effort was required because participants engaged in inhibi- tory processing of Forget items at encoding even if they were subsequently recognised. Think/No-Think paradigm: suppression Anderson and Green (2001) developed the Think/No-Think paradigm to assess whether individuals can actively suppress memories. Participants learn a list of cue–target word pairs (e.g., Ordeal–Roach; Steam–Train). Then they receive the cues studied earlier (e.g., Ordeal; Steam) and try to recall the associated words (e.g., Roach; Train) (respond condition) or prevent them coming to mind (suppress condition). Some cues are not presented at this stage (baseline condition).

In the same-probe test condition, the original cues are presented (e.g., Ordeal) and partic- ipants recall the corresponding target words (e.g., Roach). In the independent-probe test condition, participants are presented with a novel category cue (e.g., Roach might be cued with Insect–r). If people can suppress unwanted mem- ories, recall should be lower in the suppress than the respond condition. Recall should also be lower in the suppress condition than the baseline condition. Anderson and Huddleston (2012) carried out a meta-analysis of 47 experiments and found strong support for both predictions (see Figure 6.26). However, suppression attempts were often unsuccessful: in the suppress condition (same-probe test), 82% of items were recalled. What strategies do individuals use to produce successful suppression of unwanted memories? Direct suppression (focusing on the cue word and blocking out the associated target word) is an important strategy. Thought substitution (associating a different non-target word with each cue word) is also very common. Bergström et al. (2009) found these strategies were comparably effective in reducing recall in the suppress condition. Anderson et al. (2016b) pointed out the Think/No-Think paradigm is unrealistic in that we rarely make deliberate efforts to retrieve suppressed memories in everyday life. They argued it would be more realistic to assess the involuntary or spontaneous retrieval of suppressed memories. They found suppression was even more effective than voluntary retrieval at reducing involuntary retrieval of such memories. How do suppress instructions cause forgetting? Anderson (e.g., Anderson & Huddleston, 2012) argues inhibitory control is important – the learned response to the cue word is inhibited. More specifically, he assumes inhibitory control involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other frontal areas. Prefrontal activation leads to reduced activation in the hippocampus (of central importance in learning and memory). There is much support for the above hypothesis. First, there is typ- ically greater dorsolateral prefrontal activation during suppression attempts than retrieval but reduced hippocampal activation (Anderson et al., 2016b). Second, studies focusing on connectivity between the dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus indicated the former influ- ences the latter (Anderson et al., 2016b). Third, individuals whose left and right hemisphere frontal areas involved in inhibitory control are most closely coordinated exhibit superior memory suppression (Smith et al., 2018).

Progress has been made in identifying the underlying mechanisms. Of most importance, inhib- itory control mechanisms associated with the prefrontal cortex (especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) often reduce hippocampal activation (Anderson et al., 2016b). What are the limitations of theory and research in this area? First, more research is required to clarify the reasons why suppression attempts are often unsuccessful. Second, the reduced recall typically obtained in the suppress condition is not always due exclusively to inhibitory processes. Some individuals use thought substitution, a strategy which reduces recall by producing interference or competition with the correct words (Bergström et al., 2009). However, del Prete et al. (2015) argued (with supporting evi- dence) that inhibitory processes play a part in explaining the successful use of thought substitution. Cue-dependent forgetting We often attribute forgetting to the weakness of relevant memory traces. However, forgetting often occurs because we lack the appropriate retrieval cues (cue-dependent forgetting). For example, suppose you have forgotten the name of an acquaintance. If presented with four names, however, you might well recognise the correct one. Tulving (1979) argued that forgetting typically occurs when there is a poor match or fit between memory-trace information and information available at retrieval. This notion was expressed in his encoding specificity principle: “The probability of successful retrieval of the target item is a monotonically increasing function of informational overlap between the information present at retrieval and the information stored in memory” (p. 478). (If you are bewildered, note that a “monotonically increasing function” is one that generally rises and does not decrease at any point.) The encoding specificity principle resembles the notion of transfer- appropriate processing (Morris et al., 1977; discussed earlier, see p. 263). The main difference is that the latter focuses more directly on the processes involved in memory. Tulving (1979) assumed that when we store infor- mation about an event, we also store information about its context. According to the encoding specificity principle, memory is better when the retrieval context is the same as that at learning. Note that context can be external (the environment in which learning and retrieval occur) or internal (e.g., mood state). Eysenck (1979) argued that long-term memory does not depend only on the match between informa- tion available at retrieval and stored information. The extent to which the retrieval information allows us KEY TERM Encoding specificity principle The notion that retrieval depends on the overlap between the information available at retrieval and the information in the memory trace.

Findings Recognition memory is typically much better than recall (e.g., we can rec- ognise names we cannot recall). However, it follows from the encoding specificity principle that recall will be better than recognition memory when information in the recall cue overlaps more than that in the recognition cue with memory-trace information. This surprising finding has been reported many times. For example, Muter (1978) found people were better at recall- ing famous names (e.g., author of the Sherlock Holmes stories: Sir Arthur Conan ___) than selecting the same names on a recognition test (e.g., DOYLE). Much research indicates the importance of context in determining for- getting. On the assumption that information about mood state (internal context) is often stored in the memory trace, there should be less forget- ting when the mood state at learning and retrieval is the same rather than different. This phenomenon (mood-state-dependent memory) has often been reported (see Chapter 15). Godden and Baddeley (1975) manipulated external context. Divers learned words on a beach or 10 feet underwater and then recalled the words in the same or the other environment. Recall was much better in the same environment. However, Godden and Baddeley (1980) found no effect of context in a very similar experiment testing recognition memory rather than recall. This probably happened because the presence of the learned items on the rec- ognition test provided powerful cues outweighing any impact of context. Bramão and Johansson (2017) found that having the same picture context at learning and retrieval enhanced memory for word pairs pro- vided that each word pair was associated with a different picture context. However, having the same picture context at learning and retrieval impaired memory when each word pair was associated with the same picture context. In this condition, the picture context did not provide useful information specific to each of the word pairs being tested. The encoding specificity principle can be expressed in terms of brain activity: “Memory success varies as a function of neural encoding patterns being reinstated at retrieval” (Staudigl et al., 2015, p. 5373). Several studies have supported the notion that neural reinstatement is important for memory success. For example, Wing et al. (2015) presented scenes paired with matching verbal labels at encoding and asked participants to recall the scenes in detail when presented with the labels at retrieval. Recall perfor- mance was better when brain activity at encoding and retrieval was similar in the occipito-temporal cortex, which is involved in visual processing. Limitations on the predictive power of neural reinstatement were shown by Mallow et al. (2015) in a study on trained memory experts learning the locations of 40 digits presented in a matrix. They turned the numbers into concrete objects, which were then mentally inserted into a memorised route. On average, they recalled 86% of the digits in the correct order. However, none of the main brain areas active during encoding was acti- vated during recall: thus, there was remarkably little neural reinstatement.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nLearning, memory and forgetting 289 This happened because the processes occurring during encoding were very different from (and much more complex than) those occurring at retrieval. Suppose you learn paired associates including park–grove and are later given the cue word park and asked to supply the target or response word (i.e., grove). The response words to the other paired associates are either associated with park (e.g., tree; bench; playground) or not associated. In the latter case, the cue is uniquely associated with the target word and so your task should be easier. There is high overload when a cue is associated with several response words and low overload when it is only associated with one response word. The target word is more distinctive when there is low overload (distinctiveness was discussed earlier in the chapter). Goh and Lu (2012) tested the above predictions. Encoding-retrieval overlap was manipulated by using three item types. There was maximal overlap when the same cue was presented at retrieval and learning (e.g., park–grove followed by park–???); this was an intra-list cue. There was moderate overlap when the cue was a strong associate of the target word (e.g., airplane–bird followed by feather–???). Finally, there was little overlap when the cue was a weak associate of the target word e.g., roof–tin fol- lowed by armour–???). As predicted from the encoding specificity principle, encoding- retrieval overlap was important (see Figure 6.27). However, cue overload was also important – memory performance was much better when each cue was uniquely associated with a single response word. According to the encoding specificity principle, memory performance should be best when encoding-retrieval overlap is highest (i.e., with intra-list cues). However, that was not the case with high overload. Evaluation Tulving’s approach based on the encoding specificity principle has several strengths. The overlap between memory-trace informa- tion and that available in retrieval cues often determines retrieval success. The principle has also received some support from neuro- imaging studies and research on mood-state- dependent memory (see Chapter 15). The notion that contextual information (external and internal) strongly influences memory per- formance has proved correct. What are the limitations with Tulving’s approach? First, he exaggerated the impor- tance of encoding-retrieval overlap as the major factor determining remembering and forgetting. Remembering typically involves rejecting incorrect items as well as select- ing correct ones. For this purpose, a cue’s ability to discriminate among memory traces is important (Bramão & Johansson, 2017; Eysenck, 1979; Goh & Lu, 2012).

This is especially the case when the processes at retrieval are very different from those used at encoding (e.g., Mallow et al., 2015). Third, Tulving’s assumption that retrieval-cue information is compared directly with memory-trace information is oversimplified. For example, you would probably use complex problem-solving strategies to answer the question, “What did you do six days ago?”. Remembering is a more dynamic, reconstructive process than implied by Tulving (Nairne, 2015a). Fourth, as Nairne (2015a, p. 128) pointed out, “Each of us regularly encounters events that ‘match’ prior episodes in our lives . . . but few of these events yield instances of conscious recollection.” Thus, we experience less conscious recollection than implied by the encoding specificity principle. Fifth, it is not very clear from the encoding specificity principle why context effects are often greater on recall than recognition memory (e.g., Godden & Baddeley, 1975, 1980). Sixth, memory allegedly depends on “informational overlap” between memory trace and retrieval environment, but this is rarely assessed. Inferring the amount of informational overlap from memory performance is circular reasoning. Consolidation and reconsolidation The theories discussed so far identify factors that cause forgetting, but do not indicate clearly why the rate of forgetting decreases over time. The answer may lie in consolidation. According to this theory, consolidation “refers to the process by which a temporary, labile memory is transformed into a more stable, long-lasting form” (Squire et al., 2015, p. 1). According to the standard theory, episodic memories are initially dependent on the hippocampus. However, during the process of consoli- dation, these memories are stored within cortical networks. This theory is oversimplified: the process of consolidation involves bidirectional interac- tions between the hippocampus and the cortex (Albo & Gräff, 2018). The key assumption of consolidation theory is that recently formed memories are still being consolidated and so are especially vulnerable to interference and forgetting. Thus, “New memories are clear but fragile and old ones are faded but robust” (Wixted, 2004, p. 265). Findings Much research supports consolidation theory. First, the decreased rate of forgetting typically found over time can be explained by assuming recent memories are more vulnerable than older ones due to an ongoing consoli- dation process. Second, there is research on retrograde amnesia, which involves impaired memory for events occurring before amnesia onset. As predicted by consolidation theory, patients with damage to the hippocampus often show greatest forgetting for memories formed shortly before amnesia onset and least for more remote memories (e.g., Manns et al., 2003). However, the findings are somewhat mixed (see Chapter 7).

Electroconvulsive therapy reduced their memory for programmes up to 3 years beforehand from 65% to 42% but had no effect on memories acquired 4 to 17 years earlier. Third, individuals who drink excessively sometimes experience “blackouts” (an almost total loss of memory for events occurring while drunk). These blackouts probably indicate a failure to consolidate mem- ories formed while intoxicated. As predicted, Moulton et al. (2005) found long-term memory was impaired in individuals who drank alcohol shortly before learning. However, alcohol consumption shortly after learning led to improved memory. Alcohol may inhibit the subsequent formation of new memories that would interfere with the consolidation process of mem- ories formed just before alcohol consumption. Fourth, consolidation theory predicts newly formed memories are more susceptible to retroactive interference than older ones. There is some support for this prediction when the interfering material is dissimilar to that in the first learning task (Wixted, 2004). Fifth, consolidation processes during sleep can enhance long-term memory (Paller, 2017). Consider a technique known as target memory reactivation: sleeping participants are exposed to auditory or olfactory cues (the latter relate to the sense of smell) present in the context where learning took place. This enhances memory consolidation by reactivating brain net- works (including the hippocampus) involved in encoding new information and increases long-term memory (Schouten et al., 2017). Reconsolidation Consolidation theory assumes memory traces are “fixated” because of a consolidation process. However, accumulating evidence indicates that is oversimplified. The current view is that consolidation involves progres- sive transformation of memory traces rather than simply fixation (Elsey et al., 2018). Of most importance, reactivation of previously consolidated memory traces puts them back into a fragile state that can lead to those memory traces being modified (Elsey et al., 2018). Reactivation can lead to reconsolidation (a new consolidation process). Findings Reconsolidation is very useful for updating our knowledge because pre- vious learning is now irrelevant. However, it can impair memory for the information learned originally. This is how it happens. We learn some information at Time 1. At Time 2, we learn additional information. If the memory traces based on the information learned at Time 1 are activated at Time 2, they immediately become fragile. As a result, some information learned at Time 2 will mistakenly become incorporated into the memory traces of Time 1 information and thus cause misremembering. Here is a concrete example. Chan and LaPaglia (2013) had partici- pants watch a movie about a fictional terrorist attack (original learning). Subsequently, some recalled 24 specific details from the move (e.g., a ter- rorist using a hypodermic syringe) to produce reconsolidation (reactivation) KEY TERM Reconsolidation This is a new process of consolidation occurring when a previously formed memory trace is reactivated; it allows that memory trace to be updated.

After that, the participants encountered misinformation (e.g., the terrorist used a stun gun) or neutral information (relearning). Finally, there was a recognition-memory test for the information in the movie. What did Chan and LaPaglia (2013) find? Misinformation during the relearning phase led to substantial forgetting of information from the movie in the reactivation/reconsolidation condition but not the no- reactivation condition. Reactivating memory traces from the movie triggered reconsol- idation making those memory traces vulnerable to disruption from mis- information. In contrast, memory traces not subjected to reconsolidation were not disrupted. Scully et al. (2017) reported a meta-analytic review based on 34 exper- iments. As predicted, memory reactivation made memories susceptible to behavioural interference leading to impaired memory performance for the original learning event. These findings presumably reflect a reconsolidation process. However, the mean effect size was small and some studies (e.g., Hardwicke et al., 2016) failed to obtain significant effects. Evaluation Consolidation theory explains why the rate of forgetting decreases over time. It also successfully predicts that retrograde amnesia is greater for recently formed memories and that retroactive interference effects are great- est when the interfering information is presented shortly after learning. Consolidation processes during sleep are important in promoting long-term memory and progress has been made in understanding the underlying pro- cesses (e.g., Vahdat et al., 2017). Reconsolidation theory helps to explain how memories are updated and no other theory can explain the range of phenomena associated with reconsolidation (Elsey et al., 2018). It is a useful corrective to the excessive emphasis of consolidation theory on the permanent storage of memory traces. Reconsolidation may prove very useful in clinical contexts. For example, patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically experience flashbacks (vivid re-experiencing of trauma-related events). There is preliminary evidence that reconsolidation can be used successfully in the treatment of PTSD (Elsey et al., 2018). What are the limitations of this theoretical approach? (1) Forgetting does not depend solely on consolidation but also depends on factors (e.g., encoding-retrieval overlap) not considered within the theory. (2) Consolidation theory does not explain why proactive and retroactive interference are greatest when two different responses are associated with the same stimulus. (3) Much remains to be done to bridge the gap between consolidation theory (with its focus on physical processes within the brain) and approaches to forgetting that emphasise cognitive processes. (4) Consolidation processes are very complex and only partially under- stood. For example, it has often been assumed that cortical networks become increasingly important during consolidation.

Much evidence (e.g., from amnesic patients) provides general support for the model, but it is greatly oversimplified. According to the unitary-store model, short-term memory is the temporarily activated part of long-term memory. That is partially correct. However, the crucial term “activation” is not precisely defined. In addition, research on amnesic patients and neuroimaging studies suggest the differences between short-term and long-term memory are greater than assumed by the unitary-store model. • Working memory. Baddeley’s original working memory model consisted of three components: an attention-like central executive, a phonological loop holding speech-based information, and a visuo-spatial sketchpad specialised for visual and spatial processing. However, there are doubts as to whether the visuo- spatial sketchpad is as separate from other cognitive processes and system as assumed theoretically. The importance of the central executive can be seen in brain-damaged patients whose central executive functioning is impaired (dysexecutive syndrome). The notions of a central executive and dysexecutive syndrome are oversimplified because they do not distinguish different executive functions. More recently, Baddeley added an episodic buffer that stores integrated information in multidimensional representations. • Working memory: executive functions and individual differences. Individuals high in working memory capacity have greater attentional control than low-capacity individuals, and so are more resistant to external and internal distracting information. There is a lack of conceptual clarity concerning the crucial differences between high- and low-capacity individuals, and potential costs associated with high capacity have rarely been investigated. According to the unity/diversity framework, research on executive functions indicates the existence of a common factor however, consolidation is associated with a reorganisation within the hippocampus (Dandolo & Schwabe, 2018). (5) How memory retrieval makes consolidated memories vulnerable and susceptible to reconsolidation remains unclear (Bermúdez-Rattoni & McGaugh, 2017). (6) It has not always been possible to replicate reconsolidation effects. For example, Hardwicke et al. (2016) conducted seven studies but found no evidence of reconsolidation. (7) Impaired memory performance for reactivated memory traces is typically explained as indicating that reconsolidation has disrupted storage of the original memory traces. However, it may also reflect problems with memory retrieval (Hardwicke et al., 2016).

Support for this framework has been obtained from the psychometric, neuroimaging and genetic approaches. However, research on brain-damaged patients provides only partial support for the theoretical framework. • Levels of processing. Craik and Lockhart (1972) focused on learning processes in their levels-of-processing theory. They identified depth of processing, elaboration of processing and distinctiveness of processing as key determinants of long-term memory. Insufficient attention was paid to the relationship between learning processes and those at retrieval and to the role of distinctive processing in enhancing long-term memory. The theory is not explanatory, and the reasons why depth of processing influences explicit memory much more than implicit memory remain unclear. • Learning through retrieval. Long-term memory is typically much better when much of the learning period is devoted to retrieval practice rather than study and the beneficial effects of retrieval practice extend to relevant but non-tested information. The testing effect is greater when it is hard to retrieve the to-be- remembered information. Difficult retrieval probably enhances the generation and retrieval of effective mediators. There is a reversal of the testing effect when numerous items are not retrieved during testing practice; this reversal is explained by the bifurcation model. • Implicit learning. Behavioural findings support the distinction between implicit and explicit learning even though most measures of implicit learning are relatively insensitive. The brain areas activated during implicit learning (e.g., striatum) often differ from those activated during explicit learning (e.g., prefrontal cortex). However, complexities arise because there are numerous forms of implicit learning, and learning is often a mixture of implicit and explicit. Amnesic patients provide some support for the notion of implicit learning because they generally have less impairment of implicit than explicit learning. Parkinson’s patients with damage to the basal ganglia show the predicted impairment of implicit learning. However, they generally also show impaired explicit learning and so provide only limited information concerning the distinction between implicit and explicit learning. • Forgetting from long-term memory. Some forgetting from long- term memory is due to a decay process operating mostly during sleep. Strong proactive and retroactive interference effects have been found inside and outside the laboratory. People use active control processes to minimise proactive interference.

Memories can be deliberately suppressed with inhibitory control processes within the prefrontal cortex producing reduced hippocampal activation. Forgetting depends in part on encoding-retrieval overlap (encoding specificity principle). However, retrieval is often a more complex and dynamic process than implied by this principle. Consolidation theory explains the form of the forgetting curve but de-emphasises the role of cognitive processes. Reconsolidation theory explains how memories are updated and provides a useful corrective to consolidation theory’s excessive emphasis on permanent storage. However, the complex processes involved in consolidation and reconsolidation are poorly understood. FURTHER READING Baddeley, A.D., Eysenck, M.W. & Anderson, M.C. (2020). Memory (3rd edn).

Much of this information is stored in schemas or organ- ised packets of knowledge used extensively during language comprehension (see Chapter 10). This remarkable variety is inconsistent with Atkinson and Shiffrin’s (1968) notion of a single long-term memory store (see Chapter 6). More recently, there has been an emphasis on memory systems (note the plural!). Each memory system is distinct, having its own specialised brain areas and being involved in certain forms of learning and memory. Schacter and Tulving (1994) identified four memory systems: episodic memory; seman- tic memory; the perceptual representation system; and procedural memory. Since then, there has been a lively debate concerning the number and nature of long-term memory systems. Amnesia Suggestive evidence for several long-term memory systems comes from brain-damaged patients with amnesia. If you are a movie fan you may have mistaken ideas about the nature of amnesia (Baxendale, 2004). In the movies, serious head injuries typically cause characters to forget the past while still being fully able to engage in new learning. In the real world, however, new learning is typically greatly impaired as well. Bizarrely, many movies suggest the best cure for amnesia caused by severe head injury is to suffer another blow to the head! Approximately 40% of Americans believe a second blow to the head can restore memory in patients whose amnesia was caused by a previous blow (Spiers, 2016). Patients become amnesic for various reasons. Closed head injury is the most common cause. However, patients with closed head injury often have several other cognitive impairments making it hard to interpret their memory deficits. As a result, much research has focused on patients whose amnesia is due to chronic alcohol abuse (Korsakoff’s syndrome). Chapter 7 KEY TERMS Amnesia A condition caused by brain damage in which there is severe impairment of long-term memory (mostly declarative memory).

When he was 27, his epileptic condition was treated by surgery involving removal of his medial temporal lobes including the hippocampus. This affected his memory more dramatically than his general cognitive functioning (e.g., IQ). Corkin (1984, p. 255) reported many years later that HM “does not know where he lives, who cares for him, or where he ate his last meal . . . in 1982 he did not recognise a picture of himself”. Research on HM (starting with Scoville and Milner, 1957) transformed our understanding of long-term memory in several ways (see Eichenbaum, 2015): (1) Scoville and Milner’s article was “the origin of modern neuroscience research on memory” (Eichenbaum, 2015, p. 71). (2) HM showed reasonable learning and long-term retention on a mirror-tracing task (drawing objects seen only in reflection) (Corkin, 1968). He also showed learning on the pursuit rotor (manual tracking of a moving target) suggesting there is more than one long-term memory system. (3) HM had essentially intact short-term memory supporting the important distinction between short-term and long-term memory (see Chapter 6). (4) HM had generally good memory for events occurring a long time before his operation. This suggests memories are not stored permanently in the hippocampus. Research on HM led to an exaggerated emphasis on the role of the hippocampus in memory (Aggleton, 2013). His memory problems were greater than those experienced by the great majority of amnesic patients with hippocampal damage. This probably occurred mainly because surgery removed other areas (e.g., the parahippocampal region) and possibly because the anti-epileptic drugs used by HM damaged brain cells relevant to memory (Aggleton, 2013). The notion that HM’s brain damage exclusively affected his long-term memory for memories formed after his operation is oversimplified (Eichenbaum, 2015). Evidence suggests HM had various deficits in his perceptual and cognitive capacities. It also indicates he had impaired memory for public and personal events occurring prior to his operation. Thus, HM’s impairments were more widespread than generally assumed. In sum, we need to beware of “the myth of HM” (Aly & Ranganath, 2018, p. 1), which consists of two mistaken assumptions. First, while the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe are important in episodic memory (memory for personal events), episodic memory depends on a network that includes several other brain regions. For example, Vidal-Piñeiro et al. (2018) found that long-lasting episodic memories were associated with greater activation at encoding in inferior lateral parietal regions as well as the hippocampus. Second, the role of the hippocampus is not limited to memory. It also includes “other functions, such as perception, working memory, and implicit memory [memory not involving conscious recollection]” (Aly & Ranganath, 2018, p. 1). This issue is discussed later (see pp. 332–336). Henry Molaison, the most famous amnesic patient of all time. Research on him transformed our knowledge of the workings of long-term memory.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\n298 Memory Korsakoff patients are said to suffer from the “amnesic syndrome”: ● anterograde amnesia: a marked impairment in the ability to learn and remember information encountered after the onset of amnesia; ● retrograde amnesia: problems in remembering events prior to amnesia onset (see Chapter 6); ● only slightly impaired short-term memory on measures such as digit span (repeating back a random string of digits); ● some remaining learning ability (e.g., motor skills). The relationship between anterograde and retrograde amnesia is typically strong. Smith et al. (2013) obtained a correlation of +.81 between the two forms of amnesia in patients with damage to the medial temporal lobes. However, new learning is more easily disrupted by limited brain damage within the medial temporal lobes than is memory for previously acquired information. This probably occurs because there has typically been consol- idation (see Glossary) of previously acquired information prior to amnesia onset. Further evidence the brain areas (and processes) underlying the two forms of amnesia differ was provided by Buckley and Mitchell (2016). Damage to the retrosplenial cortex (connected to the hippocampus) caused retrograde amnesia but not anterograde amnesia. There are problems with using Korsakoff patients. First, amnesia typi- cally has a gradual onset caused by an increasing deficiency of the vitamin thiamine. Thus, it is often unclear whether certain past events occurred before or after amnesia onset. Second, brain damage in Korsakoff patients typically involves the medial temporal lobes (especially the hippocampus; see Figure 7.1). However, there is often damage to the frontal lobes as well producing various cognitive deficits (e.g., impaired cognitive control). This compli- cates interpreting findings from these patients. Third, the precise area of brain damage (and thus the pattern of memory impairment) varies across patients. For example, some Korsakoff patients exhibit confusion, lethargy and inattention.

Brain plasticity and learning of compensatory strategies mean patients can grad- ually alleviate some memory problems (Fama et al., 2012). In sum, the study of amnesic patients has triggered several theoret- ical developments. For example, the distinction between declarative and non-declarative memory (see below) was originally proposed in part because of findings from amnesic patients. Declarative vs non-declarative memory Historically, the most important distinction between different types of long-term memory was between declarative memory and non- declarative memory (Squire & Dede, 2015). Declarative memory involves conscious recollection of events and facts – it often refers to memories that can be “declared” or described but also includes memories that cannot be described verbally. Declarative memory is sometimes referred to as explicit memory and involves knowing that something is the case. The two main forms of declarative memory are episodic and seman- tic memory. Episodic memory is concerned with personal experiences of events that occurred in a given place at a specific time. Semantic memory consists of general knowledge about the world, concepts, language and so on. In contrast, non-declarative memory does not involve conscious recol- lection. We typically obtain evidence of non-declarative memory by observ- ing changes in behaviour. For example, consider someone learning to ride a bicycle. Their cycling ability improves over time even though they cannot consciously recollect what they have learned. Non-declarative memory is sometimes known as implicit memory. There are various forms of non-declarative or implicit memory. One is memory for skills (e.g., piano playing; bicycle riding). Such memory involves knowing how to perform certain actions and is known as proce- dural memory. Another form of non-declarative memory is priming (also known as repetition priming): it involves facilitated processing of a stimu- lus presented recently (Squire & Dede, 2015, p. 7). For example, it is easier to identify a picture as a cat if a similar picture of a cat has been presented previously. The earlier picture is a prime facilitating processing when the second cat picture is presented. Amnesic patients find it much harder to form and remember declara- tive than non-declarative memories. For example, HM (discussed above) had extremely poor declarative memory for personal events occurring after his operation and for faces of those who became famous in recent decades. In stark contrast, he had reasonable learning ability and memory for non-declarative tasks (e.g., mirror tracing; the pursuit rotor; perceptual identification aided by priming). This chapter contains detailed discussion of declarative and non- declarative memory. Figure 7.2 presents the hugely influential traditional theoretical account, which strongly influenced most of the research dis- cussed in this chapter. However, it is oversimplified. At the end of this chapter, we discuss its limitations and possible new theoretical developments KEY TERMS Declarative memory A form of long-term memory that involves knowing something is the case; it involves conscious recollection and includes memory for facts (semantic memory) and events (episodic memory); sometimes known as explicit memory. Non-declarative memory Forms of long-term memory that influence behaviour but do not involve conscious recollection (e.g., priming; procedural memory); also known as implicit memory. Procedural memory This is memory concerned with knowing how and it includes the knowledge required to perform skilled actions. Priming Facilitating the processing of (and response) to a target stimulus by presenting a stimulus related to it shortly beforehand.

DECLARATIVE MEMORY Declarative or explicit memory encompasses numerous different kinds of memories. For example, we remember what we had for breakfast this morning and that “le petit déjeuner” is French for “breakfast”. Tulving (1972) argued the crucial distinction within declarative memory was between what he termed “episodic memory” and “semantic memory” (see Eysenck & Groome, 2015b). What is episodic memory? According to Tulving (2002, p. 5), “It makes possible mental time travel through subjective time from the present to the past, thus allowing one to re-experience . . . one’s own previous experiences.” Nairne (2015b) identified the three “Ws” of episodic memory: remembering a specific event (what) at a given time (when) in a particular place (where). What is semantic memory? It is “an individual’s store of knowledge about the world. The content of semantic memory is abstracted from actual experience and is therefore said to be conceptual, that is, generalised and without reference to any specific experience” (Binder & Desai, 2011, p. 527). What is the relationship between episodic memory and autobiograph- ical memory (discussed in Chapter 8)? Both are concerned with personal past experiences. However, much information in episodic memory is trivial Figure 7.2 The traditional theoretical account based on dividing long-term memory into two broad classes: declarative and non- declarative. Declarative memory is divided into episodic and semantic memory, whereas non-declarative memory is divided into procedural memory, priming, simple classical conditioning, and habituation and sensitisation. The assumption that there are several forms of long-term memory is accompanied by the further assumption that different brain regions are associated with each one. From Henke (2010).

In contrast, autobiographical memory typ- ically stores information for long periods of time about personally signifi- cant events and experiences. What is the relationship between episodic and semantic memory? According to Tulving (2002), episodic memory developed out of semantic memory during the course of evolution. It also develops later in childhood than semantic memory. Episodic vs semantic memory If episodic and semantic memory form separate memory systems, they should differ in several ways. Consider the ability of amnesic patients to acquire new episodic and semantic memories. Spiers et al. (2001) reviewed 147 cases of amnesia involving damage to the hippocampus or fornix. Episodic memory was impaired in all cases, whereas many patients had rel- atively small impairment of semantic memory. The above difference in the impact of hippocampal brain damage sug- gests episodic and semantic memory are distinctly different. However, the greater vulnerability of episodic memories than semantic ones may occur mainly because episodic memories are formed from a single experience whereas semantic memories often combine several learning opportunities. We would have stronger evidence if we discovered brain-damaged patients with very poor episodic memory but essentially intact semantic memory. Elward and Vargha-Khadem (2018) reviewed research on patients with developmental amnesia (amnesia due to hippocampal damage at a young age). These patients, “typically show relatively preserved semantic memory and factual knowledge about the natural world despite severe impairments in episodic memory” (p. 23). Vargha-Khadem et al. (1997) studied two patients (Beth and Jon) with developmental amnesia. Both had very poor episodic memory for the day’s activities and television programmes, but their semantic memory (language development; literacy; and factual knowledge) were within the normal range. However, Jon had various problems with semantic memory (Gardiner et al., 2008). His rate of learning was slower than that of healthy controls when provided with facts concerning geographical, historical and other kinds of knowledge. Similarly slow learning in semantic memory has been found in most patients with developmental amnesia (Elward & Vargha-Khadem, 2018). The findings from patients with developmental amnesia are surpris- ing given the typical finding that individuals with an intact hippocampus depend on it for semantic memory acquisition (Baddeley et al., 2020). Why, then, is their semantic memory reasonably intact? Two answers have been proposed. First, developmental amnesics typically devote more time than healthy individuals to repeated study of factual information. This may produce durable long-term semantic memories via a process of con- solidation (see Glossary and Chapter 6). Second, episodic memory may depend on the hippocampus whereas semantic memory depends on the underlying entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Note the brain damage suffered by Jon and Beth centred on the hippocampus. Bindschaedler et al.

His performance on semantic memory tasks (e.g., vocabu- lary) improved at the normal rate even though his performance was very poor on episodic memory tasks. Many amnesics may have severe problems with episodic and semantic memory because the hippocampus and underlying cor- tices are both damaged. This is very likely given the two areas are adjacent. Curot et al. (2017) applied electrical brain stimulation to memory- related brain areas to elicit reminiscences. Semantic memories were mostly elicited by stimulation of the rhinal cortex (including the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices). In contrast, episodic memories were only elicited by stimulation of the hippocampal region. Blumenthal et al. (2017) studied a female amnesic (HC) with severe hippocampal damage but intact perirhinal and entorhinal cortices. She was given the semantic memory task of generating intrinsic features of objects (e.g., shape; colour) and extrinsic features (e.g., how the object is used). HC performed comparably to controls with intrinsic features but signifi- cantly worse than controls with extrinsic features. Thus, the hippocampus is important for learning some aspects of semantic memory. How can we explain Blumenthal et al.’s (2017) findings? The hip- pocampus is involved in learning associations between objects and contexts in episodic memory (see final section of the chapter, pp. 332–340). In a similar fashion, generating extrinsic features of objects requires learning associations between objects and their uses. Retrograde amnesia We turn now to amnesic patients’ problems with remembering information learned prior to the onset of amnesia: retrograde amnesia (see Glossary and Chapter 6). Many amnesic patients have much greater retrograde amnesia for episodic than semantic memories. Consider the amnesic patient KC. According to Tulving (2002, p. 13), “He cannot recollect any personally experienced events . . ., whereas his semantic knowledge [e.g. general world knowledge] acquired before the critical accident is still reasonably intact.” There is much support for the notion that remote semantic memories formed prior to the onset of amnesia are essentially intact (see Chapter 6). For example, amnesic patients often perform comparably to healthy controls on semantic memory tasks (e.g., vocabulary knowledge; object naming). However, Klooster and Duff (2015) argued such findings may reflect the use of insensitive measures. In their study, Klooster and Duff gave amnesic patients the semantic memory task of listing features of common objects. On average, amnesic patients listed only 50% as many features as healthy controls. Retrograde amnesia for episodic memories in amnesic patients often spans several years and has a temporal gradient, i.e., older memories showing less impairment (Bayley et al., 2006). In contrast, retrograde amnesia for semantic memories is generally small except for knowledge acquired shortly before amnesia onset (Manns et al., 2003). In sum, retrograde amnesia is typically greater for episodic than seman- tic memories. However, semantic memories can be subject to retrograde amnesia when assessed using sensitive measures.

However, their episodic memory and most cog- nitive functions (e.g., attention; non-verbal problem solving) are reasona- bly intact initially. Semantic dementia always involves degeneration of the anterior temporal lobes. Areas such as the perirhinal and entorhinal cortex are probably involved in the formation of semantic memories. In contrast, the anterior temporal lobes are where such memories are stored semi- permanently. However, episodic memory and executive functioning are reasonably intact in the early stages. Patients with semantic dementia have great problems accessing infor- mation about concepts stored in semantic memory (Lambon Ralph et al., 2017). However, their performance on many episodic memory tasks is good (e.g., they have intact ability to reproduce complex visual designs: Irish et al., 2016). They also have comparable performance to healthy con- trols in remembering what tasks they performed 24 hours earlier and where those tasks were performed (Adlam et al., 2009). Landin-Romero et al. (2016) reviewed relevant research. The good epi- sodic memory of semantic dementia patients probably occurs because they make effective use of the frontal and parietal regions within the brain. In sum, we have an apparent double dissociation (see Glossary). Amnesic patients have very poor episodic memory but often reasonably intact semantic memory. In contrast, patients with semantic dementia have very poor semantic memory but reasonably intact episodic memory. However, the double dissociation is only approximate and it is hard to interpret the somewhat complex findings. Interdependence of episodic and semantic memory We have seen the assumption that there are separate episodic and semantic memory systems is oversimplified. Here we focus on the interdependence of episodic and semantic memory. In a study by Renoult et al. (2016), partic- ipants answered questions belonging to four categories: (1) unique events (e.g., “Did you drink coffee this morning?”); (2) general factual knowledge (e.g., “Do many people drink coffee?”); (3) autobiographical facts (e.g., “Do you drink coffee every day?”); and (4) repeated personal events (e.g., “Have you drunk coffee while shopping?”). Category 1 involves episodic memory and category 2 involves semantic memory. Categories 3 and 4 involve per- sonal semantic memory (a combination of episodic and semantic memory). Renoult et al. (2016) used event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) during retrieval for all four question categories. There were clear-cut ERP differences between categories 1 and 2. Of most importance, ERP patterns for category 3 and 4 questions were intermediate between those for cate- gories 1 and 2 suggesting they required retrieval from both episodic and semantic memory. Tanguay et al. (2018) reported similar findings. They interpreted the various findings with reference to personal semantics: aspects of autobi- ographical memory resembling semantic memory in being factual but also resembling episodic memory in being “idiosyncratically personal” (p. 65).

Amnesic patients and healthy controls generated as many members as possible from various categories. Some categories (e.g., kitchen utensils) were selected so that performance would benefit from using epi- sodic memory, whereas other categories (e.g., things typically red) seemed less likely to involve episodic memory. Amnesic patients performed worse than controls especially with categories potentially benefitting from epi- sodic memory. With those categories, controls were much more likely than patients to use episodic memory as an efficient organisational strategy to generate category members. Semanticisation of episodic memory Robin and Moscovitch (2017) argued initially episodic memories are trans- formed into semantic memories over time. For example, the first time you went to a seaside resort, you formed episodic memories of your experiences there. As an adult, while you still remember visiting that seaside resort as a child, you have probably forgotten the personal and contextual informa- tion originally associated with your childhood memories. Thus, what was an episodic memory has become a semantic memory. This change involves semanticisation of episodic memory and suggests episodic and semantic memories are related. Robin and Moscovitch (2017) argued the process of semanticisation often involves a memory transformation from an initially detail-rich epi- sodic representation to a gist-like or schematic representation involving semantic memory. They provided a theoretical framework within which to understand these processes (see Figure 7.3). There is much support for this theoretical approach (discussed later). For example, Gilboa and Marlatte (2017) found in a meta-analytic review that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is typically involved in schema pro- cessing within semantic memory. Sekeres et al. (2016) tested memory for movie clips. There was much more forgetting of peripheral detail over time (episodic memory) than of the gist (semantic memory). St-Laurent et al. (2016) found amnesic patients with hippocampal damage had reduced processing of episodic perceptual details. Robin and Moscovitch (2017) discussed research focusing on changes in brain activation during recall as time since learning increased. As pre- dicted, there was reduced anterior hippocampal activation but increased activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings reflected increased use of gist or schematic information compensating for reduced availability of details. Overall evaluation There is some support for separate episodic and semantic memory systems in the double dissociation involving amnesia and semantic dementia: the former is associated with greater impairment of episodic than seman- tic memory whereas the latter is associated with the opposite pattern. However, there are complications in interpreting these findings and the KEY TERM Semanticisation The phenomenon of episodic memories changing into semantic memories over time.

In addition, episodic and semantic memory are often interdependent at learning and during retrieval, making it hard to disentangle their respective contributions. EPISODIC MEMORY How can we assess someone’s episodic memory following learning (e.g., a list of to-be-remembered items)? Recognition and recall are the two main types of episodic memory test. Recognition-memory tests generally involve presenting various items with participants deciding whether each one was presented previously (often 50% were presented previously and 50% were not). As we will see, more complex forms of recognition-memory test have also been used. There are three types of recall test: free recall, serial recall and cued recall. Free recall involves producing previously presented items in any order in the absence of specific cues. Serial recall involves producing previously pre- sented items in the order they were presented. Cued recall involves produc- ing previously presented items to relevant cues. For example, “cat–table” might be presented at learning and the cue, “cat–???” at test. KEY TERMS Free recall A test of episodic memory in which previously presented to-be-remembered items are recalled in any order. Serial recall A test of episodic memory in which previously presented to-be- remembered items must be recalled in the order of presentation. Cued recall A test of episodic memory in which previously presented to-be-remembered items are recalled in response to relevant cues. Figure 7.3 Episodic memories (involving perceptual representations and specific details) depend on the posterior hippocampus (pHPC); semantic memories (involving schemas) depend on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC); and gist memories (combining episodic and semantic memory) depend on the anterior hippocampus (aHPC). There are interactions between these forms of memory caused by processes such as construction and elaboration. From Robin and Moscovitch (2017). Reprinted with permission of Elsevier.

Recollection involves recognition based on conscious retrieval of contextual information whereas such conscious retrieval is lacking in familiarity-based recognition (Brandt et al., 2016). Here is a concrete example. Several years ago, the first author walked past a man in Wimbledon, and was immediately confident he recognised him. However, he simply could not think where he had previ- ously seen the man. After some thought (this is the kind of thing academic psychologists think about!), he realised the man was a ticket-office clerk at Wimbledon railway station. Initial recognition based on familiarity was replaced by recognition based on recollection. The remember/know procedure (Migo et al., 2012) has often been used to assess familiarity and recollection. List learning is followed by a test where participants indicate whether each item is “Old” or “New”. Items identified as “Old” are followed by a know or remember judgement. Typical instructions require participants to respond know if they recognise the list words, “but these words fail to evoke any specific conscious recol- lection from the study list” (Rajaram, 1993, p. 102). They should respond remember if “the ‘remembered’ word brings back to mind a particular association, image, or something more personal from the time of study” (Rajaram, 1993, p. 102). Dunn (2008) proposed a single-process account: strong memory traces give rise to recollection judgements whereas weak memory traces give rise to familiarity judgements. As we will see, however, most evidence supports a dual- or two-process account, namely, that recollection and familiarity involve different processes. Brain mechanisms Diana et al. (2007) provided an influential theoretical account of the key brain areas involved in recognition memory in their binding-of-item-and- context model (see Figure 7.4): (1) The perirhinal cortex receives information about specific items (what information needed for familiarity judgements). (2) The parahippocampal cortex receives information about context (where information useful for recollection judgements). (3) The hippocampus receives what and where information (both of great importance to episodic memory) and binds them to form item–context associations permitting recollection. Findings Functional neuroimaging studies support the above model. In a meta- analytic review, Diana et al. (2007) found recollection was associated with more activation in parahippocampal cortex and the hippocampus than perirhinal cortex. In contrast, familiarity was associated with more activation in perirhinal cortex than the parahippocampal cortex or hippocampus.

In principle, more direct evidence could be obtained from brain-damaged patients. Bowles et al. (2010) studied amnesic patients with severe hippocampal damage. As predicted, these patients had significantly impaired recollection but not familiarity. However, other research has typically found amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage have a minor impairment in familiarity but a much larger one in recollection (Skinner & Femandes, 2007). According to the model, patients with damage to the perirhinal cortex should have largely intact recollection but impaired familiarity. Bowles et al. (2011) tested this prediction with a female patient, NB. As predicted, her recollection performance was consistently intact. However, she had impaired familiarity for verbal materials. Brandt et al. (2016) studied a female patient, MR, with selective damage to entorhinal cortex (adjacent to perirhinal cortex and previously linked to familiarity). As predicted, MR had impaired familiarity for words but intact recollection.

This is too limited. Diana (2017) used a non-spatial context – words were accompanied by contextual questions (e.g., “Is this word common or uncommon?”). There was greater parahippocampal activation for words associated with correct (rather than incorrect) context memory. Since the context (i.e., contextual questions) was non-spatial, the role of the parahippocampal cortex in epi- sodic memory extends beyond spatial information. Dual-process models assume the hippocampus is required to process relationships between items and to bind items to contexts but is not required to process items in isolation. There are two potential problems with these assumptions (Bird, 2017). First, the term “item” is often impre- cisely defined. Second, these models often de-emphasise the importance of the learning material (e.g., faces; names; pictures). Smith et al. (2014) compared immediate memory performance in healthy controls and amnesic patients with hippocampal damage. Fifty famous faces were presented followed by a recognition-memory test. The amnesic patients performed comparably to controls for famous faces not identified as famous but were significantly impaired for famous faces identified as famous. A plausible interpretation is that unfamiliar faces (i.e., unknown famous faces) are processed as isolated items and so do not require hippocampal processing. In contrast, known famous faces benefit from additional contextual processing dependent on the hippocampus. Bird (2017, p. 161) concluded his research review as follows: “There are no clear-cut examples of materials other than [unfamiliar] faces that can be recognised using extrahippocampal [outside the hippocam- pus] familiarity processes.” This is because most “items” are not pro- cessed in isolation but require the integrative processing provided by the hippocampus. Scalici et al. (2017) reviewed research on the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in familiarity and recollection. There was greater familiarity-based than recollection-based activity in the ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and lateral BA10 (at the front of the pre- frontal cortex) whereas the opposite was the case in medial BA10 (see Figure 7.5). These findings suggest familiarity and recollection involve dif- ferent processes. Evaluation Recognition memory depends on rather separate processes of familiar- ity and recollection, as indicated by neuroimaging studies. However, the most convincing findings come from studying brain-damaged patients. A double dissociation has been obtained – some patients have reasonably intact familiarity but impaired recollection whereas a few patients exhibit the opposite pattern. What are the limitations of theory and research in this area?

Brainerd et al. (2014) found a model assuming two types of recollection predicted behavioural data better than models assuming only one type of recollection. (2) Diana et al.’s (2007) model does not identify the processes underlying familiarity judgements. However, it is often assumed that items on a recognition-memory test that are easy to process are judged to be familiar. Geurten and Willems (2017) tested this assumption using unfamiliar pictures. On the recognition-memory test, some pictures were presented with reduced contrast to reduce processing fluency (see Figure 7.6). As predicted, recognition-memory performance was better with high- contrast than with low-contrast test pictures (70% vs 59%, respectively).

(4) The notion of an “item” requires more precise definition (Bird, 2017). Recall memory Here we will consider briefly similarities and differences between recall (especially free recall: see Glossary) and recognition memory. Mickes et al. (2013) reported important similarities using the remember/know proce- dure with free recall. Participants received a word list and for each word answered one question (e.g., “Is this item animate?”; “Is this item bigger than a shoebox?”). They then recalled the words, made a remember or know judgement for each recalled word and indicated which question had been associated with each word (contextual information). Participants were more accurate at remembering which question was associated with recalled words when the words received remember (rather than know) judgements. This is very similar to recognition memory where participants access more contextual information for remember words than know ones. Kragel and Polyn (2016) compared patterns of brain activation during recognition-memory and free-recall tasks. Brain areas activated during familiarity processes in recognition memory were also activated during free recall. There was also weaker evidence that brain areas activated during recollective processes in recognition were activated in free recall. As we have seen, amnesic patients exhibit very poor recognition memory (especially recognition associated with recollection). Amnesic patients also typically have very poor free recall (e.g., Brooks & Baddeley, 1976). Some aspects of recognition memory depend on structures other than the hippocampus itself (Diana et al., 2007). In contrast, it has typically been assumed the hippocampus is crucial for recall memory. Patal et al. (2015) supported these assumptions in patients with relatively selective hip- pocampal damage. The extent of hippocampal damage in these patients was negatively correlated with their recall performance but uncorrelated with their recognition-memory performance. There are several similarities between the processes involved in recall and recognition. However, the to-be-remembered information is physically present on recognition tests but not recall tests. As a result, processing demands should generally be less with recognition. Chan et al. (2017) obtained findings consistent with this analysis in patients with damage to the frontal lobes impairing higher-level cognitive processes. Individual dif- ferences in intelligence were strongly related to performance on recall tests but not recognition-memory tests. Thus, recall performance depends much more on higher-level cognitive processes. Is episodic memory constructive? We use episodic memory to remember experienced past events. Most people believe the episodic memory system resembles a video recorder pro- viding us with accurate and detailed information about past events (Simons & Chabris, 2011).

In fact, “Episodic memory is . . . a fundamentally Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nLong-term memory systems 311 constructive, rather than reproductive process that is prone to various kinds of errors and illusions” (Schacter & Addis, 2007, p. 773). For example, the constructive nature of episodic memory leads to distorted remembering of stories (Chapter 10) and to eyewitnesses producing inaccurate memories of crimes (Chapter 8). Why is episodic memory so error-prone? First, it would require massive processing to produce a semi-permanent record of all our experi- ences. Second, we typically want to access the gist or essence of our past experiences, omitting trivial details. Third, we often enrich our episodic memories when discussing our experiences with friends even when this pro- duces memory errors (Dudai & Edelson, 2016; see Chapter 8). What are the functions of episodic memory (other than to remember past events)? First, we use episodic memory to imagine possible future sce- narios and to plan the future (Madore et al., 2016). Imagining the future (episodic simulation) is greatly facilitated by episodic memory’s flexible and constructive nature. According to Addis (2018), remembered and imagined events are both very similar, “simulations of experience from the same pool of experiential details” (p. 69). However, Schacter and Addis (2007) assumed in their constructive episodic simulation hypothesis that episodic simulation is more demanding than episodic memory retrieval because control processes are required to combine details from multiple episodes. Second, Madore et al. (2019) found episodic memory influences diver- gent creative thinking (thinking of unusual and creative uses for common objects). Creative thinking was associated with enhanced connectivity between brain areas linked to episodic processing and brain areas associ- ated with cognitive control. Findings The tendency to recall the gist of our previous experiences increases throughout childhood (Brainerd et al., 2008). More surprisingly, children’s greater focus on remembering gist as they become older often increases memory errors. Brainerd and Mojardin (1998) asked children to listen to sentences such as “The tea is hotter than the cocoa”. Subsequently, they decided whether test sentences had been presented previously in precisely that form. Sentences having the same meaning as an original sentence but different wording (e.g., “The cocoa is cooler than the tea”) were more likely to be falsely recognised by older children. We turn now to the hypothesis (Schacter & Addis, 2007; Addis, 2018) that imagining future events involves very similar processes to those involved in remembering past episodic events. On that hypothesis, brain areas important for episodic memory (e.g., the hippocampus) should also be activated when imagining future events. Benoit and Schacter (2015) reported supportive evidence. There were two key findings: (1) Several brain regions were activated both while imagining future events (episodic simulation) and during episodic-memory recollection (see Figure 7.7A). The overlapping areas included “the hippocam- pus and parahippocampal cortex within the medial temporal lobes” (Benoit & Schacter, 2015, p. 450).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\n312 Memory (2) As predicted, several brain areas were more strongly activated during episodic simulation than episodic memory retrieval (see Figure 7.7B). These included clusters in the dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior infe- rior parietal lobes and clusters in the right medial temporal lobe (including the hip- pocampus) (Benoit & Schacter, 2015, p. 453). Some of these areas are involved in cognitive control – the borders of the fronto-parietal control network (see Chapter 6) are indicated by white dashed lines. Imagining future events is generally associated with hippocampal activation. We would have more direct evidence the hippocampus is nec- essarily involved if amnesic patients with hip- pocampal damage had impaired ability to imagine future events. Hassabis et al. (2007) found amne- sics’ imaginary experiences consisted of iso- lated fragments lacking the richness and spatial coherence of healthy controls’ experiences. The amnesic patient KC with extensive brain damage (including to the hippocampus) could not recall a single episodic memory from the past or imagine a possible future event (Schacter & Madore, 2016). Robin (2018) argued that spatial context is of major importance for both episodic memory and imagining future events. For example, Robin et al. (2016) asked participants to read brief nar- ratives and imagine them in detail. Even when no spatial context was specified in the narrative, participants nevertheless generated an appropri- ate spatial context while imagining on 78% of trials. The similarities between recall of past personal events and imagining future personal events have typically been attributed to episodic processes common to both tasks. However, some similarities may also reflect non-episodic processes. For example, amnesics’ impaired past recall and future imagining may reflect an impaired ability to construct detailed narrative. Schacter and Madore (2016) provided convincing evidence that episodic processes are involved in recalling past events and imagin- ing future ones. Participants received training in recollecting details of a recent experience. If recall of past events and imaging of future events both rely on episodic memory, this induction should benefit performance by increasing participants’ production of episodic details in recall and imagination. That is what was found. Figure 7.7 (A) Areas activated for both episodic simulation and episodic memory; (B) areas activated more for episodic simulation than episodic memory.

This assumption is supported by research on eyewitness memory (Chapter 8) and language comprehension (Chapter 10). The additional assumption that constructive processes used in episodic memory retrieval of past events are also involved in imagining future events is an exciting development sup- ported by much relevant evidence. Episodic memory is also involved in divergent creative thinking. What are the main limitations of research in this area? First, several brain areas associated with recalling past personal events and imagining future events have been identified, but their specific contributions remain somewhat unclear. Second, finding a given area is involved in recalling the past and imagining the future does not necessarily mean it is associated with the same cognitive processes in both cases. Third, there is greater uncertainty about future events than past ones. This may explain why imagined future events are less vivid than recalled past events but more abstract and dependent on semantic memory (MacLeod, 2016). SEMANTIC MEMORY Our organised general knowledge about the world is stored in semantic memory. Such knowledge is extremely varied (e.g., information about the French language; the rules of hockey; the names of capital cities). Much of this information consists of concepts: mental representations relating to objects, people, facts and words (Lambon Ralph et al., 2017). These rep- resentations are multimodal (i.e., they incorporate information from several sense modalities). How is conceptual information in semantic memory organised? We start this section by addressing this issue. First, we consider the notion that concepts are organised into hierarchies. Second, we discuss an alternative view, according to which semantic memory is organised on the basis of the semantic distance or semantic relatedness between concepts. After that, we focus on the nature of concepts and on how concepts are used. Finally, we consider larger information structures known as schemas. Organisation: hierarchies of concepts Suppose you are shown a photograph of a chair and asked what it is. You might say it is an item of furniture, a chair or an easy chair. This suggests concepts are organised into hierarchies. Rosch et al. (1976) identified three levels within such hierarchies: superordinate categories (e.g., items of furni- ture) at the top, basic level categories (e.g., chair) in the middle and subordi- nate categories (e.g., easy chair) at the bottom. Which level do we use most often? Sometimes we talk about superor- dinate categories (e.g., “That furniture is expensive”) or subordinate cate- gories (e.g., “I love my iPhone”). However, we typically deal with objects at the intermediate or basic level. Rosch et al. (1976) asked people to list concept attributes at each level in the hierarchy. Very few attributes were listed for superordinate KEY TERM Concepts Mental representations of categories of objects or items.

However, very similar attributes were listed for different categories at the lowest level. Thus, basic level categories generally have the best balance between informativeness and distinctiveness: informativeness is low at the highest level of the hierarchy and distinctive- ness is low at the lowest level. In similar fashion, Rigoli et al. (2017) argued (with supporting evidence) that categorising objects at the basic level gen- erally allows us to select the most appropriate action with respect to that object while minimising processing costs. Bauer and Just (2017) found the processing of basic level concepts involved many more brain regions than the processing of subordinate concepts. More specifically, brain areas associated with sensorimotor and language processing were activated with basic level concepts, whereas processing was focused on perceptual areas with subordinate concepts. Basic level categories have other special properties. First, they repre- sent the most general level at which individuals use similar motor move- ments when interacting with category members (e.g., we sit on most chairs in similar ways). Second, basic level categories were used 99% of the time when people named pictures of objects (Rosch et al., 1976). However, we do not always prefer basic level categories. For example, we expect experts to use subordinate categories. We would be surprised if a botanist simply described all the different kinds of plants in a garden as plants! We also often use subordinate categories with atypical category members. For example, people categorise penguins faster as penguins than as birds (Jolicoeur et al., 1984). Findings Tanaka and Taylor (1991) studied category naming in bird-watchers and dog experts who were shown pictures of birds and dogs. Both groups used subordinate names much more often in their expert domain than their novice domain. Even though people generally prefer basic level categories, this does not necessarily mean they categorise fastest at that level. Prass et al. (2013) presented photographs of objects very briefly and asked participants to cat- egorise them at the superordinate level (animal or vehicle), the basic level (e.g., cat or dog) or the subordinate level (e.g., Siamese cat vs Persian cat). Performance was most accurate and fastest at the superordinate level (see Figure 7.8). In similar fashion, Besson et al. (2017) found categorisation of faces was fastest at the superordinate level. Why does categorisation often occur faster at the superordinate level than the basic level? Close and Pothos (2012) argued that categorisation at the basic level is generally more informative and so requires more detailed processing. Rogers and Patterson (2007) supported this viewpoint. They studied patients with semantic dementia, a condition involving impair- ment of semantic memory (discussed earlier in this chapter, p. 303; see Glossary). Patients with severe semantic dementia performed better at the superordinate level than the basic level because less processing was required.

Collins and Loftus (1975) proposed an approach based on the more flexible assumption that semantic memory is organised in terms of the semantic distance between concepts. Semantic distance between concepts has been measured in many ways (Kenett et al., 2017). Kenett et al. used data from 60 individuals instructed to produce as many associations as possible in 60 seconds to 800 Hebrew cue words in order to assess semantic distance in terms of path length: “the shortest number of steps connecting any two cue words” (p. 1473). Kenett et al. (2017) asked participants to judge whether word pairs were semantically related. These judgements were well predicted by path distance: 91% of directly linked words (one-step) were judged to be seman- tically related, compared to 69% of two-step word pairs and 64% of three- step word pairs. Of importance, Kenett et al. (2017) found semantic distance predicted performance on various episodic memory tasks (e.g., free recall). In an experiment on cued recall, participants were presented with word pairs. This was followed by presenting the first word of each pair and instruct- ing them to recall the associated word. Performance was much higher on directly linked word pairs (1-step) than three-step word pairs: 30% vs 11%, respectively. Semantic distance also predicts aspects of language production. For example, Rose et al. (2019) had participants name target pictures (e.g., eagle) in the presence of distractor pictures that were semantically close (e.g., owl) or semantically distant (e.g., gorilla). There was an interference effect: naming times were longer when distractors were semantically close. What is the underlying mechanism responsible for the above findings? According to Collins and Loftus’s (1975) influential spreading-activation theory, the appropriate node in semantic memory is activated when we see, hear or think about a concept. Activation then spreads rapidly to other concepts, with greater activation for concepts closely related seman- tically than those weakly related. Such an account can readily explain Rose et al.’s (2019) findings. Figure 7.8 Accuracy of (a) object categorisation and (b) speed of categorisation at the superordinate, basic and subordinate levels.

For example, dog is recognised as a word faster when the preceding prime is cat than when it is car (Heyman et al., 2018). This can be explained by assuming that presentation of cat activates the dog concept and so facilitates recognising it as a word. In sum, the semantic distance of concepts within semantic memory is important in explaining findings in episodic memory research (e.g., free recall; cued recall) as well as findings relating to language processing. However, this approach is based on the incorrect assumption that each concept has a single fixed representation in semantic memory. Our process- ing of any given concept is influenced by context (see next section). For example, think about the meaning of piano. You probably did not focus on the fact that pianos are heavy. However, you would do so if you read the sentence “Fred struggled to lift the piano”. Thus, the meaning of any concept (and its relation to other concepts) varies as a function of the cir- cumstances in which it is encountered. Using concepts: Barsalou’s approach What do the mental representations of concepts look like? The “traditional” view involved the following assumptions about concept representations: ● They are abstract and so detached from input (sensory) and output (motor) processes. ● They are stable: the same concept representation is used on different occasions. ● Different individuals have similar representations of any given concept. In sum, it was assumed concept representations “have the flavour of detached encyclopaedia descriptions in a database of categorical knowledge about the world” (Barsalou, 2012, p. 247). This approach forms part of the sandwich model (Barsalou, 2016b): cognition (including concept processing) is “sandwiched” between perception and action and can be studied without considering them. How, then, could we use such concept representations to perceive the visual world or decide how to behave in a given situation (Barsalou, 2016a)? Barsalou (2012) argued all the above theoretical assumptions are incorrect. We process concepts in numerous different settings and that pro- cessing is influenced by the current setting or context. More generally, any concept’s representation varies flexibly across situations depending on the individual’s current goals and the precise situation. Consider the concept of a bicycle. A traditional abstract representation would resemble the Chambers Dictionary definition, a “vehicle with two wheels one directly in front of the other, driven by pedals”. According to Barsalou (2009), the individual’s current goals determine which features are activated. For example, the saddle’s height is important if you want to ride a bicycle, whereas information about the tyres is activated if you have a puncture. According to Barsalou’s theoretical approach (e.g., 2012, 2016a,b), conceptual processing is anchored in a given context or situation and Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["c and subordinate levels.","From Prass et al."]}

His approach is described as grounded cognition: cognition (including concept processing) is largely grounded (or based) on the perceptual and motor systems. Findings Evidence that conceptual processing can involve the perceptual system was reported by Wu and Barsalou (2009). Participants wrote down properties for nouns or noun phrases. Those given the word lawn focused on external properties (e.g., plant; blades) whereas those given rolled-up lawn focused more on internal properties (e.g., dirt; soil). Thus, object qualities not visible if you were actually looking at the object itself are harder to think of than visible ones. We might expect Barsalou’s grounded cognition approach to be less applicable to abstract concepts (e.g., truth; freedom) than concrete ones (objects we can see or hear). However, Barsalou et al. (2018) argued that abstract concepts are typically processed within a relatively concrete context. In fact, abstract-concept processing sometimes involves perceptual information but much less often than concrete-concept processing (Borghi et al., 2018). Hauk et al. (2004) reported suggestive evidence that the motor system is often involved when we access concept information. When participants read words such as “lick”, “pick” and “kick”, these verbs activated parts of the motor strip overlapping with areas activated when people make the relevant tongue, finger and foot movements. These findings do not show the motor system is necessary for concept processing – perhaps activation in areas within the motor strip occurs only after concept activation. Miller et al. (2018) asked participants to make hand or foot responses after reading hand-associated words (e.g., knead; wipe) or foot- associated words (e.g., kick; sprint). Responses were faster when the word was compatible with the limb making the response (e.g., hand response to a hand-associated word) than when word and limb were incompatible. These findings apparently support Barsalou’s approach, according to which “The understanding of action verbs requires activa- tion of the motor areas used to carry out the named action” (Miller et al., 2018, p. 335). Miller et al. (2018) tested the above prediction using event-related potentials (see Glossary) to assess limb-relevant brain activity. However, presentation of hand- and foot-associated words was not followed rapidly by limb-relevant brain activity. Thus, the reaction time findings discussed above were based on processing verb meanings and did not directly involve motor processing. How can we explain the differences in the findings obtained by Hauk et al. (2004) and by Miller et al. (2018)? Miller et al. used a speeded task that allowed insufficient time for motor imagery (and activation of relevant motor areas) to occur, whereas this was not the case with the study by Hauk et al. According to Barsalou, patients with severe motor system damage should have difficulty in processing action-related words (e.g., names of Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["016a,b), conceptual processing is anchored in a given context or situation and Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","Long-term memory systems 317 involves the perceptual and motor or action systems."]}

Dreyer et al. (2015) studied HS, a patient with damage to sensori- motor brain systems close to the hand area. He had specific problems in recognising nouns relating to tools rather than those referring to food or animals. In a review, Vannuscorps et al. (2016) found some studies reported findings consistent with Dreyer et al.’s (2015) research. In other studies, however, patients with damage to sensorimotor systems had no deficit in conceptual processing of actions or manipulable objects. Vannuscorps et al. concluded many patients with deficits in processing concepts relating to actions and tool have extensive damage to brain areas additional to sen- sorimotor areas. The findings from such patients have limited relevance to Barsalou’s (2016b) theory. Vannuscorps et al. (2016) studied a patient, JR, with brain damage primarily affecting the action production system. JR’s picture-naming ability was assessed repeatedly over a 3-year period. Even though JR’s disease was progressive, his naming performance with action-related con- cepts (e.g., hammer; shovel) remained intact. Thus, processing of action- related concepts does not necessarily require the involvement of the motor system. Evaluation Barsalou’s general theoretical approach has several strengths. First, our everyday use of concept knowledge often involves the perceptual and motor systems. Second, concept processing is generally flexible: it is influenced by the present context and the individual’s goals. Third, it is easier to see how concept representations facilitate perception and action within Barsalou’s approach than the “traditional” approach. What are the limitations of Barsalou’s approach? First, Barsalou argues it is generally necessary to use perceptual and/or motor processes to understand concept meanings fully. However, motor processes may often not be necessary (Miller et al., 2018; Vannuscorps et al., 2016). Second, Barsalou exaggerates variations in concept processing across time and contexts. The traditional view that concepts possess a stable, abstract core has not been disproved (Borghesani & Piazza, 2017). In fact, concepts have a stable core and concept processing is often context- dependent (discussed below). Third, much concept knowledge does not consist simply of perceptual and motor features. Borghesani and Piazza (2017, p. 8) provide the follow- ing example: “Tomatoes are native to South and Central America.” Fourth, we recognise the similarities between concepts not sharing perceptual or motor features. For example, we categorise watermelon and blackberry as fruit even though they are very different visually and we eat them using different motor actions. Using concepts: hub-and-spoke model We have seen concept processing often involves the perceptual and motor systems. However, it is improbable nothing else is involved.

Second, as mentioned above, we can detect similarities in con- cepts differing greatly in perceptual terms. Such considerations led Patterson et al. (2007) to propose their hub- and-spoke model (see Figure 7.9). The “spokes” consist of several modality- specific regions involving sensory and motor processing. Each concept also has a “hub” – a modality-independent unified representation efficiently integrating our conceptual knowledge. It is assumed hubs are located within the anterior temporal lobes. As discussed earlier, patients with semantic dementia invariably have damage to the anterior temporal lobes and extensive loss of conceptual knowledge is their main problem. In the original model, it was assumed the two anterior temporal lobes (left and right hemisphere) formed a unified system. This is approximately correct – there is substantial activation in both anterior temporal lobes whether concepts are presented visually or verbally. However, the left ante- rior temporal lobe was more involved than the right in processing verbal information whereas the opposite was the case in processing visual infor- mation (Rice et al., 2015). Lambon Ralph et al. (2017) discussed research where patients with damage to the left anterior temporal lobe had par- ticular problems with anomia (object naming). In contrast, patients with damage to the right anterior temporal lobe had particular problems in face recognition. Findings We start with research on the “hub”. Mayberry et al. (2011) argued seman- tic dementia involves a progressive loss of “hub” information producing Figure 7.9 The hub-and-spoke model.

Accordingly, they predicted semantic dementia patients would have par- ticular problems making accurate category-membership decisions with (1) atypical category members (e.g., emu is an atypical bird); and (2) pseudo- typical items: non-category members resembling category members (e.g., butterfly is like a bird). Both predictions were supported with pictures and words, suggesting processing within the anterior temporal lobes is general and “hub-like” rather than modality-specific (e.g., confined to the visual modality). Findings from patients with semantic dementia suggest the anterior temporal lobes are the main brain areas associated with “hubs”. Binder et al. (2009) reviewed 120 neuroimaging studies involving semantic memory in healthy individuals and found the anterior temporal lobes were consist- ently activated. Pobric et al. (2010a) applied transcranial magnetic stimu- lation (TMS; see Glossary) to interfere with processing in the left or right anterior temporal lobe while participants processed concepts presented by verbal or pictorial stimuli. TMS disrupted concept processing comparably in both anterior temporal lobes. However, Murphy et al. (2017) discovered important differences between ventral (bottom) and anterior (front) regions of the anterior tem- poral lobe. Ventral regions responded to meaning and acted as a hub. However, anterior regions were responsive to differences in input modality (visual vs auditory) and thus are not “hub-like”. We turn now to research on the “spokes”. Pobric et al. (2010b) applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to interfere briefly with process- ing within the inferior parietal lobule (involved in processing actions we can make towards objects; the praxis spoke in Figure 7.9). TMS slowed naming times for manipulable objects but not non-manipulable ones indi- cating this brain area (unlike the anterior temporal lobes) is involved in relatively specific processing. Findings consistent with those of Pobric et al. (2010b) were reported by Ishibashi et al. (2018). They applied transcranial direct current stimu- lation (tDCS; see Glossary) to the inferior parietal lobule and the anterior temporal lobe. Since they used anodal tDCS, it was expected this stimula- tion would enhance performance on tasks requiring rapid access to seman- tic information concerning tool function (e.g., scissors are used for cutting) or tool manipulation (e.g., pliers are gripped by the handles). As predicted, anodal tDCS applied to the anterior temporal lobe facil- itated performance on both tasks because this brain area contains much general object knowledge (see Figure 7.10). The effects of anodal tDCS applied to the inferior parietal lobule were limited to the manipulation task as predicted because this area processes action-related information. Suppose we studied patients whose brain damage primarily affected one or more of the “spokes”. According to the model, we should find category-specific deficits (problems with specific categories of objects). There is convincing evidence for the existence of various category-specific deficits and these deficits are mostly associated with the model’s spokes (Chen et al., 2017). However, it is often hard to interpret the findings from patients with category-specific deficits. For example, many patients find it much harder KEY TERM Category-specific deficits Disorders caused by brain damage in which semantic memory is disrupted for certain semantic categories.

Several factors are involved: living things have greater contour overlap than non-living things, they are more complex structurally and they activate less motor informa- tion (Marques et al., 2013). It is difficult to disentangle the relative impor- tance of these factors. Finally, we consider a study by Borghesani et al. (2019). Participants read words (e.g., elephant) having conceptual features (e.g., mammal) and perceptual features (e.g., big; trumpeting). There were two main find- ings. First, conceptual and perceptual features were processed in different brain areas. Second, initial processing of both types of features occurred approximately 200 ms after word onset. These findings support the model’s assumptions that there is somewhat independent processing of “hub” infor- mation (i.e., conceptual features) and “spoke” information (i.e., perceptual features). However, the findings are inconsistent with Barsalou’s approach, according to which perceptual processing should precede (and influence) conceptual processing. Evaluation The hub-and-spoke model provides a comprehensive approach combin- ing aspects of the traditional view of concept processing and Barsalou’s approach. The notion within the model that concepts are represented by abstract core information and modality-specific information has strong support. Brain areas associated with different aspects of concept processing have been identified. What are the model’s limitations? First, it emphasises mostly the storage and processing of single concepts. However, we also need to con- sider relations between concepts. For example, we can distinguish between taxonomic relations based on similarity (e.g., dog–bear) and thematic rela- tions based on proximity (e.g., dog–leash). The anterior temporal lobes are important for taxonomic semantic processing whereas the temporo-parietal Figure 7.10 Performance accuracy on tool function and tool manipulation tasks with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL-A) or to the inferior parietal lobule (IPL-A) and in a control condition (Sham).

The model has problems with the latter finding given its focus on the ante- rior temporal lobes. Second, the role of the anterior temporal lobes in semantic memory is more complex than assumed theoretically. For example, Mesulam et al. (2013) found semantic dementia patients with damage primarily to the left anterior temporal lobe had much greater problems with verbal concepts than visually triggered object concepts. Thus, regions of the left anterior temporal lobe form part of a language network rather than a very general modality-independent hub. Third, we have only a limited understanding of the division of labour between the hub and the spokes during concept processing (Lambon Ralph, 2014). For example, we do not know how the relative importance of hub-and-spoke processing depends on task demands. It is also unclear how information from hubs and spokes is integrated during concept processing. Schemas vs concepts We may have implied semantic memory consists exclusively of concepts. In fact, there are also larger information structures called schemas. Schemas are “superordinate knowledge structures that reflect abstracted common- alities across multiple experiences” (Gilboa & Marlatte, 2017, p. 618). Scripts are schemas containing information about sequences of events. For example, your restaurant script probably includes the following: being given a menu, ordering food and drink, eating and drinking and paying the bill (Bower et al., 1979). Scripts (and schemas more generally) are discussed in Chapter 10 (in relation to language comprehension and memory) and Chapter 8 (relat- ing to failures of eyewitness memory). Here we first consider brain areas associated with schema-related information. We then explore implications of the theoretical assumption that semantic memory contains abstract con- cepts corresponding to words and broader organisational structures based on schemas. On that assumption, we might expect some brain-damaged patients would have greater problems accessing concept-based information than schema-based information, whereas others would exhibit the opposite pattern. This is a double dissociation (see Glossary). Brain networks Schema information and processing involves several brain areas. However, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is especially important. It includes several Brodmann Areas including BA10, BA11, BA12, BA14 and BA25 (see Figure 1.5). Gilboa and Marlatte (2017) reviewed 12 fMRI experiments where participants engaged in schema processing. Much of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was consistently activated, plus other areas including the hippocampus. Research on brain-damaged patients also indicates the important role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in schema processing. Ghosh et al. (2014) gave participants a schema (“going to bed at night”) and asked KEY TERMS Schema An organised packet of information about the world, events or people stored in long-term memory.

Patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex performed worse than healthy controls on this task, indicating impaired schema- related processing. Warren et al. (2014) presented participants with words belonging to a single schema (e.g., winter; blizzard; cold) followed by recall. Healthy individuals often falsely recall a schema-relevant non-presented word (e.g., snow) because their processing and recall involve extensive schema process- ing. If patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex engage in minimal schema processing, they should show reduced false recall. That is what Warren et al. found. Double dissociation As discussed earlier, brain-damaged patients with early-stage semantic dementia (see Glossary) have severe problems accessing word and object meanings. Bier et al. (2013) assessed the ability of three semantic demen- tia patients to use schema-relevant information by asking them what they would do if they had unknowingly invited two guests to lunch. The required script actions included dressing to go outdoors, going to the grocery store, shopping for food, preparing the meal and clearing up afterwards. One patient successfully described all the above script actions accu- rately despite severe problems with accessing concept information from semantic memory. The other patients had particular problems with plan- ning and preparing the meal. However, they remembered script actions relating to dressing and shopping. Note we might expect semantic demen- tia patients to experience problems with using script knowledge because they would need access to relevant concept knowledge (e.g., knowledge about food ingredients) when using script knowledge (e.g., preparing a meal). Other patients have greater problems with accessing script information than concept meanings. Scripts typically have a goal-directed quality (e.g., using a script to achieve the goal of enjoying a restaurant meal). Since the prefrontal cortex is of major importance in goal-directed activity, we might expect patients with prefrontal damage (e.g., ventromedial prefron- tal cortex) to have particular problems with script memory. Cosentino et al. (2006) studied patients having semantic dementia or fronto-temporal dementia (involving extensive damage to the prefron- tal cortex and the temporal lobes) with scripts containing sequencing or script errors (e.g., dropping fish in a bucket before casting the fishing line). Patients with extensive prefrontal damage failed to detect far more sequencing or script errors than those with semantic dementia. Farag et al. (2010) confirmed that patients with fronto-temporal dementia are generally less sensitive than those with semantic dementia to the appropriate order of script events. They identified the areas of brain damage in their participants (see Figure 7.11). Patients (including fron- to-temporal ones) insensitive to script sequencing had damage in inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, patients (including those with semantic dementia) sensitive to script sequencing showed little evi- dence of prefrontal damage.

(2017) also studied patients with fronto-temporal dementia with damage to the fronto-polar cortex (BA10, part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and the anterior temporal lobe. They assessed patients’ knowledge of social concepts (e.g., adventurous) and script knowledge (e.g., the likely long-term consequences of ignoring their employer’s requests). Patients with greater damage to the fronto-polar cortex than the anterior temporal lobe showed relatively poorer script knowledge than knowledge of social concepts. In contrast, patients with the oppo- site pattern of brain damage had relatively poorer knowledge of social concepts. In sum, semantic memory for concepts centres on the anterior tempo- ral lobe. Patients with semantic dementia have damage to this area causing severely impaired concept memory. In contrast, semantic memory for scripts or schemas involves the prefrontal cortex (especially ventromedial prefron- tal cortex). However, when we use our script knowledge (e.g., preparing a Figure 7.11 (a) Brain areas damaged in patients with fronto-temporal degeneration or progressive non-fluent aphasia.

As a consequence, semantic dementia patients whose primary impairment is to concept knowledge also have great diffi- culties in accessing and using script knowledge. NON-DECLARATIVE MEMORY Non-declarative memory does not involve conscious recollection but instead reveals itself through behaviour. As mentioned earlier, priming (the facilitated processing of repeated stimuli) and procedural memory (mainly skill learning) are two major forms of non-declarative memory. Note that procedural memory is typically involved in implicit learning (discussed in Chapter 6). There are two major differences between priming (also known as repe- tition priming) and procedural memory: (1) Priming often occurs rapidly whereas procedural memory or skill learning is typically slow and gradual (Knowlton & Foerde, 2008). (2) Priming is tied fairly closely to specific stimuli whereas skill learning typically generalises to numerous stimuli. For example, it would be useless if you could hit a good backhand at tennis only when the ball approached you from a given direction at a given speed! The strongest evidence for distinguishing between declarative and non- declarative memory comes from amnesic patients. Such patients mostly have severely impaired declarative memory but almost intact non- declarative memory (but see next section for a more complex account). Oudman et al. (2015) reviewed research on priming and procedural memory or skill learn- ing in amnesic patients with Korsakoff’s syndrome (see Glossary). Their per- formance was nearly intact on tasks such as the pursuit rotor (a stylus must be kept in contact with a target on a rotating turntable) and the serial reac- tion time task (see Glossary). Amnesic patients performed poorly on some non-declarative tasks reviewed by Oudman et al. (2015) for various reasons. First, some tasks require declarative as well as non-declarative memory. Second, some Kors akoff’s patients have widespread brain damage (including areas involved in non-declarative memory). Third, the distinction between declarative and non-declarative memory is less clear-cut and important than traditionally assumed (see later discussion). Repetition priming We can distinguish between perceptual and conceptual priming. Perceptual priming occurs when repeated presentation of a stimulus leads to facilitated processing of its perceptual features. For example, it is easier to identify a degraded stimulus if it was presented shortly beforehand. Conceptual priming occurs when repeated presentation of a stimulus leads to facilitated processing of its meaning. For example, we can decide faster whether an object is living or non-living if we saw it recently.

(2016) found patients with frontal lobe damage performed poorly on conceptual priming but had intact perceptual priming. In contrast, patients with occipital lobe damage (an area associ- ated with visual processing) had intact conceptual priming but impaired perceptual priming. If repetition priming involves non-declarative memory, amnesic patients should show intact repetition priming. This prediction has much support. For example, Cermak et al. (1985) found amnesic patients had comparable perceptual priming to controls. However, patients sometimes exhibit a modest priming impairment. Levy et al. (2004) studied conceptual priming: deciding whether words previously studied (vs not studied) belonged to given categories. Two male amnesic patients (EP and GP) with large lesions in the medial tem- poral lobes had intact conceptual priming to healthy controls, but they performed much worse than controls on recognition memory (involving declarative memory). Much additional research was carried out on EP, who had extensive damage to the perirhinal cortex (BA35 and BA36) plus other regions within the medial temporal lobe (Insausti et al., 2013). His long-term declarative memory was massively impaired. For example, he had very poor ability to identify names, words and faces that became familiar only after amnesia onset. However, EP’s performance was intact on non-declarative tasks (e.g., perceptual priming; visuo-motor skill learning; see Figure 7.12). His performance was at chance level on recognition memory but as good as that of healthy controls on perceptual priming. Schacter and Church (1995) reported further evidence amnesic patients have intact perceptual priming. Participants initially heard words all spoken in the same voice and then identified the same words passed through an auditory filter. There was priming because identifi- cation performance was better when the words were spoken in the same voice as initially. The notion that priming depends on memory systems different from those involved in declarative memory would be strengthened if we found patients having intact declarative memory but impaired priming. This would provide a double dis- sociation when considered together with amnesics having intact priming but impaired declarative memory. Gabrieli et al. (1995) studied a patient, MS with damage to the right occipital lobe. MS had intact perfor- mance on recognition and cued recall (declar- ative memory) but impaired performance on perceptual priming. This latter finding is con- sistent with findings reported by Gong et al. (2016) in patients with occipital lobe damage (discussed earlier).

(1995) studied perceptual priming based on audi- tory word identification. However, the words were initially presented in six different voices. On the word-identification test, half were presented in the same voice as initially and the other half were spoken by one of the other voices (re-paired condition). Healthy controls (but not amnesic patients) had more priming for words presented in the same voice. How can we explain these findings? In both conditions, participants were exposed to words and voices previously heard. The only advantage in the same voice condition was that the pairing of word and voice was the same as before. However, only those participants who had linked or asso- ciated words and voices at the original presentation would have benefited from the repeated pairings. Thus, amnesics are poor at binding together different kinds of information even on priming tasks apparently involving non-declarative memory (see later discussion pp. 333–336). Related findings were obtained by Race et al. (2019). Amnesic patients had intact repetition priming when the task involved relatively simple asso- ciative learning. However, their repetition priming was impaired when the task involved more complex and abstract associative learning. Race et al. concluded “These results highlight the multiple, distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms that support repletion priming” (p. 102). Priming processes What processes are involved in priming? A popular view is based on per- ceptual fluency: repeated presentation of a stimulus means it can be pro- cessed more efficiently using fewer resources. This view is supported by the frequent finding that brain activity decreases with stimulus repetition: this is repetition suppression. However, this finding on its own does not demon- strate a causal link between repetition suppression and priming. Wig et al. (2005) reported more direct evidence using transcranial mag- netic stimulation to disrupt processing. TMS abolished repetition suppres- sion and conceptual priming suggesting that repetition suppression was necessary for conceptual priming. Stimulus repetition is sometimes associated with repetition enhance- ment involving increased brain activity with stimulus repetition. de Gardelle et al. (2013) presented repeated faces and found evidence of both stimulus suppression and stimulus enhancement. What determines whether there is repetition suppression or enhance- ment? Ferrari et al. (2017b) presented participants with repeated neutral and emotional scenes. Repetition suppression was found when scenes were repeated many times in rapid succession, probably reflecting increased per- ceptual fluency. In contrast, repetition enhancement was found when rep- etitions were spaced out in time. This was probably due to spontaneous retrieval of previously presented stimuli. Kim (2017a) reported a meta-analysis of studies on repetition suppres- sion and enhancement in repetition priming (see Figure 7.13). There were two main findings. First, repetition suppression was associated with reduced activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and related areas, suggest- ing it reflected reduced encoding of repeated stimuli.

According to Kim (2017a, p. 1894), “The mechanism for repetition enhancement is . . . explicit retrieval during an implicit memory task.” Thus, explicit or declar- ative memory is sometimes involved in allegedly non-declarative priming tasks. In sum, progress has been made in understanding the processes under- lying priming. Of importance is suggestive evidence that priming some- times involves declarative as well as non-declarative memory (Kim, 2017). The mechanisms involved in repetition suppression and priming are still not fully understood. However, these effects depend on complex interac- tions among the time interval between successive stimuli, the task and the allocation of attention (Kovacs & Schweinberger, 2016). Procedural memory or skill learning Motor skills are important in everyday life – examples include word pro- cessing, writing, playing netball and playing a musical instrument. Skill learning or procedural memory includes sequence learning, mirror tracing (tracing a figure seen in a mirror), perceptual skill learning, mirror reading (reading a text seen in a mirror) and artificial grammar learning (Foerde & Poldrack, 2009; see Chapter 6). However, although these tasks are all categorised as skill learning, they differ in terms of the precise cognitive processes involved. Here we consider whether the above tasks involve non-declarative or procedural memory and thus involve different memory systems from those underlying episodic and semantic memory. We will consider skill learn- ing in amnesic patients. If they have essentially intact skill learning but severely impaired declarative memory, that would provide evidence that different memory systems are involved. Before considering the relevant evidence, we address an important general issue. It is sometimes incorrectly assumed any given task is always Figure 7.13 Brain regions showing repetition suppression (RS; orange colour) or response enhancement (RE; blue colour) in a meta-analysis.

Consider the weather-prediction task where participants use various cues to predict whether the weather will be sunny or rainy. Reber et al. (1996) found amnesics learned this task as rapidly as healthy controls, suggesting it involves procedural (non-declarative) memory. However, Rustemeier et al. (2013) found 61% of participants used a non-declarative strategy through- out learning but 12% used a declarative strategy throughout. In addition, 27% shifted from an early declarative to a later declarative strategy. Findings Amnesics often have essentially intact skill learning on numerous skill-learning tasks. For example, using the pursuit rotor (manual track- ing of a moving target), Tranel et al. (1994) found that 28 amnesic patients had intact learning. Even a patient (Boswell) with unusually extensive brain damage to brain areas strongly associated with declarative memory had intact learning. Much research has used the serial reaction time task (see Glossary). As discussed in Chapter 6, amnesics’ performance on this task is typically rea- sonably intact. It is somewhat hard to interpret the findings because per- formance on this task by healthy controls often involves some consciously accessible knowledge (Gaillard et al., 2009). Spiers et al. (2001) considered the non-declarative memory performance of 147 amnesic patients. All showed intact performance on tasks involving priming and learning skills or habits. However, as mentioned earlier, some studies have shown modest impairment in amnesic patients (Oudman et al., 2015). In addition, amnesics’ procedural memory has important limitations: “[Amnesic patients] typically do not remember how or where informa- tion was obtained, nor can they flexibly use the acquired information. The knowledge therefore lacks a . . . context” (Clark & Maguire, 2016, p. 68). Most tasks assessing skill learning in amnesics require learning far removed from everyday life. However, Cavaco et al. (2004) used five skill-learning tasks (e.g., a weaving task) involving real-world skills. Amnesic patients showed comparable learning to healthy controls despite significantly impaired declarative memory for the same tasks. Anderson et al. (2007) studied the motor skill of car driving in two severely amnesic patients. Their steering, speed control, safety errors and driving with distraction were intact. Finally, we discuss patients with Parkinson’s disease (see Glossary). These patients have damage to the striatum (see Glossary), which is of greater importance to non-declarative learning than declarative learning. As predicted, Parkinson’s patients typically have severely impaired non- declarative learning and memory (see Chapter 6). For example, Kemeny et al. (2018) found on the serial reaction time task that Parkinson’s patients showed practically no evidence of learning (see Figure 7.14). However, Parkinson’s patients sometimes have relatively intact epi- sodic memory. For example, Pirogovsky-Turk et al. (2015) found normal performance by Parkinson’s patients on measures of free recall, cued recall and recognition memory. These findings strengthen the case for a distinction between declarative and non-declarative memory.

First, Parkinson’s patients (especially as the disease progresses) often have damage to brain areas associated with episodic memory. Das et al. (2019) found impairments in recognition memory (a form of episodic memory) among Parkinson’s patients were related to damage within the hippocampus (of central impor- tance in episodic memory). Many Parkinson’s patients also have problems with attention and executive functions (Roussel et al., 2017). Bezdicek et al. (2019) found impaired episodic memory in Parkinson’s patients was related to reduced functioning of brain areas associated with attention and executive functions as well as reduced hippocampal functioning. Second, there are individual differences in the strategies used on many tasks (e.g., weather-prediction task discussed earlier). Kemeny et al. (2018) found Parkinson’s patients and healthy controls had comparable perfor- mance on the weather-prediction task. However, most Parkinson’s patients used a much simpler strategy than healthy controls. Thus, the patients’ processing was affected by the disease although this was not apparent from their overall performance. Interacting systems A central theme of this chapter is that traditional theoretical views are over- simplified (see next section pp. 332–340). For example, skill learning often involves brain circuitry including the hippocampus (traditionally associated exclusively with episodic memory). Döhring et al. (2017) studied patients with transient global amnesia who had dysfunction of the hippocam- pus lasting for several hours. This caused profound deficits in declarative memory but also reduced learning on a motor learning task involving finger sequence tapping. Thus, optimal motor learning can require interactions of the procedural and declarative memory systems. Albouy et al. (2013) discussed research on motor sequence learning (skill learning).

Doyon et al. (2018) reviewed changes during motor sequence learning. Early learning mainly involved striatal regions in conjunction with prefrontal and premotor cor- tical regions. The contribution of the striatum and motor cortical regions increases progressively during later learning. These findings suggest proce- dural learning is dominant later in learning but that declarative memory plays a part early in learning. Similar findings are discussed by Beukema and Verstynen (2018) (see p. 276). How different are priming and skill learning? Priming and skill learning are both forms of non-declarative memory. However, as Squire and Dede (2015, p. 2) pointed out, “Non-declarative memory is an umbrella term referring to multiple forms of memory.” Thus, we might expect to find differences between priming and skill learning. As mentioned earlier, priming generally occurs more rapidly and the learning associated with priming is typically less flexible. If priming and skill learning involve different processes, we would not necessarily expect individuals good at skill learning to also be good at priming. Schwartz and Hashtroudi (1991) found no correlation between performance on a priming task (word identification) and a skill-learning task (inverted text reading). Findings based on neuroimaging or on brain-damaged patients might clarify the relationship between priming and skill learning. Squire and Dede (2015) argued the striatum is especially important in skill learning whereas the neocortex (including the prefrontal cortex) is of major impor- tance in priming. Some evidence (including research discussed above) is supportive of Squire and Dede’s (2015) viewpoint. However, other research is less sup- portive. Osman et al. (2008) found Parkinson’s patients had intact proce- dural learning when learning about and controlling a complex system (e.g., water-tank system). This suggests the striatum is not needed for all forms of skill learning. Gong et al. (2016; discussed earlier, p. 326) found patients with frontal damage nevertheless had intact perceptual priming. The wide range of tasks used to assess priming and skill learning means numerous brain regions are sometimes activated on both kinds of tasks. We start with skill learning. Penhune and Steele (2012; see Chapter 6) pro- posed a theory assuming skill learning involves several brain areas includ- ing the primary motor cortex, cerebellum and striatum. So far as priming is concerned, Segaert et al. (2013) reviewed 29 neuroimaging studies and concluded that “Repetition enhancement effects have been found all over the brain” (p. 60).

In contrast, Parkinson’s patients (especially in the early stages of the disease) sometimes have intact declarative memory but impaired procedural memory. What are the main limitations of research in this area? (1) There is considerable flexibility in the processes used on many memory tasks. As a result, it is often an oversimplification to describe a task as involving only “non-declarative memory”. (2) Numerous tasks have been used to assess priming and skill learning. More attention needs to be paid to differences among tasks in the precise cognitive processes involved. (3) There should be more emphasis on brain networks rather than specific brain areas. For example, motor sequence learning involves a stria- to-cortical system rather than simply the striatum. In addition, this system interacts with a hippocampal-cortical system (Albouy et al., 2013). (4) The findings from Parkinson’s patients are mixed and inconsistent. Why is this? As the disease progresses, brain damage in such patients typically moves beyond brain areas involved in non-declarative memory (e.g., the striatum) to areas involved in declarative memory (e.g., the hippocampus and prefrontal areas). BEYOND MEMORY SYSTEMS AND DECLARATIVE VS NON-DECLARATIVE MEMORY Until relatively recently, most memory researchers argued the distinction between declarative/explicit and non-declarative/implicit memory was of major theoretical importance. According to this traditional approach, a crucial difference between memory systems is whether they support conscious access to stored information (see Figure 7.2). It was also often assumed that only memory systems involving conscious access depend heavily on the medial temporal lobe (especially the hippocampus). The traditional approach has proved extremely successful – consider all the accurate predictions it made with respect to the research discussed earlier. However, its major assumptions are oversimplified and more complex theories are required. Explicit vs implicit memory If the major dividing line in long-term memory is between declarative (explicit) and non-declarative (implicit) memory, it is important to devise tasks involving only one type of memory. This sounds easy: declara- tive memory is involved when participants are instructed to remember previously presented information but not otherwise. Reality is more complex. Consider the word-completion task. Participants are presented with a word list. Subsequently, they perform an apparently unrelated task: word fragments (e.g., STR _____ ) are presented and they produce a word starting with those letters. Implicit memory is revealed by the extent to which their word completions match list words. Since the instructions make no reference to recall, this task is apparently Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["om those involved in declarative memory.","There is limited evidence of a double Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32."]}

However, participants who become aware of the connection between the word list and the word-completion task perform better than those who do not (Mace, 2003). Hippocampal activation is generally associated with declarative memory whereas activity of the striatum is associated with non- declarative memory. However, Sadeh et al. (2011) obtained more complex find- ings. Effective learning on an episodic memory task was associated with interactive activity between the hippocampus and striatum. Following a familiar route also often involves complex interactions between the hip- pocampus and striatum with declarative memory assisting in the guid- ance of ongoing actions retrieved from non-declarative memory (Goodroe et al., 2018). The involvement of declarative/explicit memory and non-declarative/ implicit memory on any given task sometimes changes during the course of learning and/or there are individual differences in use of the two forms of memory. Consider the acquisition of sequential motor skills. There is often a shift from an early reliance on explicit processes to a later reli- ance on implicit processes (Beukema & Verstynen, 2018; see Chapter 6). Lawson et al. (2017) reported individual differences during learning on the serial reaction time task (see Chapter 6). Some learners appeared to rely solely on implicit processes whereas others also used explicit processes. Henke’s processing-based theoretical account Several theories differing substantially from the traditional theoretical approach have been proposed. For example, compare Henke’s (2010) processing-based model (see Figure 7.15) against the traditional model (see Figure 7.2). Henke’s model differs crucially in that “Consciousness of encoding and retrieval does not select for memory systems and hence does not feature in this model” (p. 528). Another striking difference relates to declarative memory. In the tra- ditional model, all declarative memory (episodic plus semantic memory) depends on the medial temporal lobes (especially the hippocampus) and the diencephalon. In Henke’s model, in contrast, episodic memory depends on the hippocampus and neocortex, semantic memory can involve brain areas outside the hippocampus, and familiarity in recognition memory depends on the parahippocampal gyrus and neocortex (and also the per- irhinal cortex). Figure 7.15 is oversimplified. Henke (2010) argued semantic knowl- edge can be learned in two different ways: one way is indicated in the figure but the other way “uses the hippocampus and involves episodic memory formation” (p. 528). The assumption that semantic memory need not depend on the hippocampus helps to explain why amnesic patients’ seman- tic memory is generally less impaired than their episodic memory (Spiers et al., 2001). There are three basic processing modes in Henke’s (2010) model: (1) Rapid encoding of flexible associations: this involves episodic memory and depends on the hippocampus. It is also assumed semantic memory often involves the hippocampus.

(3) Rapid encoding of single or unitised items (formed into a single unit): this involves priming and familiarity in recognition memory and depends on the parahippocampal gyrus. Many predictions are common to Henke’s (2010) model and the traditional model. For example, amnesic patients with hippocampal damage should have generally poor episodic memory but intact procedural memory and priming. However, the two models make different predictions: (1) Henke’s (2010) model predicts that amnesic patients with hippocam- pal damage should have severe impairments of episodic memory (and semantic memory) for flexible relational associations but not for single or unitised items. In contrast, according to the traditional model, amnesic patients should have impaired episodic and semantic memory for single or unitised items as well as for flexible relational associations. (2) Henke’s (2010) model predicts the hippocampus is involved in the encoding of flexible associations with unconscious and conscious Figure 7.15 A processing-based memory model. There are three basic processing modes: (1) rapid encoding of flexible associations; (2) slow encoding of rigid associations; and (3) rapid encoding of single or unitised items formed into a single unit.

(3) Henke’s model predicts the hippocampus is not directly involved in familiarity judgements in recognition memory. In contrast, the tra- ditional model assumes all forms of episodic memory depend on the hippocampus. Findings We start with the first prediction above as it applies to episodic memory. Quamme et al. (2007) studied recognition memory for word pairs (e.g., CLOUD–LAWN). In the key condition, each word pair was uni- tised (e.g., CLOUD-LAWN was interpreted as a lawn used for viewing clouds). Amnesic patients with hippocampal damage had a much smaller recognition-memory deficit when the word pairs were unitised than when they were not. Olson et al. (2015) presented faces with a fixed or variable viewpoint followed by a recognition-memory test. It was assumed flexible associations would be formed only in the variable-viewpoint condition. As predicted, a female amnesic (HC) had intact performance only in the fixed-viewpoint condition (see Figure 7.16). Research by Blumenthal et al. (2017; discussed earlier, p. 302) on semantic memory is also relevant to the first prediction. An amnesic patient with hippocampal damage had impaired semantic memory performance when it depended on having formed relational associations. However, her semantic memory performance was intact when relational associations were not required. Support for the second prediction was reported by Duss et al. (2014). Unrelated word pairs (e.g., violin–lemon) were presented subliminally to amnesic patients and healthy controls. The amnesic patients had signifi- cantly poorer relational or associative encoding and retrieval than the con- trols. However, their encoding (and retrieval) of information about single Figure 7.16 Recognition memory for faces presented in a fixed or variable viewpoint and tested in a fixed or variable viewpoint; HC is a female amnesic patient.

Only the relational task involved hippocampal activation. Hannula and Greene (2012) discussed several studies showing associa- tive or relational learning can occur without conscious awareness. Of most relevance here, however, is whether the hippocampus is activated during non-conscious encoding and retrieval. Henke et al. (2003) presented par- ticipants with task–occupation pairs below the level of conscious aware- ness. There was hippocampal activation during nonconscious encoding of the face–occupation pairs. There was also hippocampal activation during non-conscious retrieval of occupations associated with faces. Finally, we turn to Henke’s third prediction, namely, that the hip- pocampus is not required for familiarity judgements in recognition memory. If so, we might predict amnesic patients should have intact famil- iarity judgements. As predicted, amnesics have intact recognition memory (including familiarity judgements) for unfamiliar faces (Bird, 2017; dis- cussed earlier, p. 308). However, the findings with unfamiliar faces are unusual because patients generally have only reasonably (but not totally) intact familiarity judgements for other types of material (Bird, 2017; Bowles et al., 2010; Skinner & Femandes, 2007) (discussed earlier, pp. 307–308). However, these findings may not be inconsistent with Henke’s (2010) model because amnesics’ brain damage often extends beyond the hippocampus to areas associated with familiarity (perirhinal cortex). A male amnesic patient (KN) with hippocampal damage but no perirhinal damage had intact familiarity performance (Aggleton et al., 2005). As shown in Figure 7.15, Henke (2010) assumed that familiarity judgements depend on activation in brain areas also involved in priming. As predicted, Thakral et al. (2016) found similar brain areas were asso- ciated with familiarity and priming, suggesting they both involve similar processes. Evaluation Henke’s (2010) model with its emphasis on memory processes rather than memory systems is an advance. We have considered several examples where predictions from her model have proved superior to predictions from the traditional approach. What are the model’s limitations? First, more research and theoris- ing are needed to clarify the role of consciousness in memory. Conscious awareness is associated with integrated processing across several brain areas (Chapter 16) and so is likely to enhance learning and memory. However, how this happens is not specified. Second, the model resembles a framework rather than a model. For example, it is assumed the acquisition of semantic memories is sometimes closely related to episodic memory. However, we cannot make precise pre- dictions unless we know the precise conditions determining when this is the case and how processes associated with semantic and episodic memory interact. Third, the model does not consider the brain networks associated with different types of memory (see below).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nLong-term memory systems 337 Does each memory system depend on a few brain areas? According to the traditional theoretical approach (see Figure 7.2), each memory system depends on only a few key brain areas (a similar assumption was made by Henke, 2010). Nowadays, however, it is generally assumed each type of memory involves several brain areas forming one or more networks. How can we explain the above theoretical shift? Early memory research relied heavily on findings from brain-damaged patients. Such findings (while valuable) are limited. They can indicate a given brain area is of major importance. However, neuroimaging research allows us to identify all brain areas asso- ciated with a given type of memory. Examples of the traditional approach’s limitations are discussed below. First, it was assumed that episodic memory depends primar- ily on the medial temporal lobe (especially the hippocampus). Neuroimaging research indicates that several other brain areas interconnected with the medial temporal lobe are also involved. In a review, Bastin et al. (2019) concluded there is a general recollection network specific to episodic memory including the inferior parietal cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex and the pos- terior cingulate cortex. Kim and Voss (2019) assessed brain activity during the forma- tion of episodic memories. They discovered that activation within large brain networks predicted subsequent recognition-memory performance (see Figure 7.17). Why did activation in certain areas predict lower recognition- memory performance? The most important reason is that such activation often reflects various kinds of task-irrelevant processing. Second, in the traditional approach (and Henke’s, 2010, model), autobiographical memories were regarded simply as a form of episodic memory. However, the retrieval of auto- biographical memories often involves more brain networks than the retrieval of simple episodic memories. As is shown in Figure 8.7, retrieval of autobiographical memories involves the fronto- parietal network, the cingulo- operculum network, the medial prefrontal cortex network and the medial temporal lobe network. Only the last of these networks is emphasised within the traditional approach (and Henke’s model). Third, more brain areas are associated with semantic memory than the medial temporal lobes emphasised in the tra- ditional model. In a meta- analysis, Binder et al. (2009) identified a left- hemisphere network consisting of seven regions including the middle temporal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and ventromedial prefron- tal cortex. Fourth, it was assumed within the traditional approach that priming involves the neocortex. In fact, what is involved is more complex. Kim (2017a; discussed earlier, pp. 327–328) found in a meta-analysis that priming is associated with reduced activation in the fronto-parietal control Figure 7.17 Brain areas whose activity during episodic learning predicted increased recognition-memory performance (task-positive; in red) or decreased performance (task-negative; in blue).

Are memory systems independent? A key feature of the traditional theoretical approach (see Figure 7.2) was the assumption that each memory system operates independently. As a con- sequence, any given memory task should typically involve only a single memory system. This assumption is an oversimplification. As Ferbinteanu (2019, p. 74) pointed out, “The lab conditions, where experiments are care- fully designed to target specific types of memories, most likely do not uni- versally apply in natural settings where different types of memories combine in fluid and complex manners to guide behaviour.” First, consider episodic and semantic memory. Earlier we consid- ered cases where episodic and semantic memory were both involved. For example, people answering questions about repeated personal events (e.g., “Have you drunk coffee while shopping?”) rely on both episodic and semantic memory (Renoult et al., 2016). Second, consider skill learning and memory. Traditionally, it was assumed that skill learning depends primarily on implicit processes. However, as we saw earlier, explicit processes are often involved early in learning processes (Beukema & Verstynen, 2018; see Chapter 6). Component-process models The traditional theoretical model is too neat and tidy: it assumes the nature of any given memory task rigidly determines the processes used. We need a theoretical approach assuming that memory processes are much more flexible than assumed within the traditional model (or Henke’s model). Dew and Cabeza (2011) proposed such an approach (see Figure 7.18). Five brain areas were identified varying along three dimensions: (1) cognitive process: perceptually or conceptually driven; (2) stimulus representation: item or relational; (3) level of intention: controlled vs. automatic. This approach is based on two major assumptions, which differ from those of previous approaches. First, there is considerable flexibility in the com- bination of processes (and associated brain areas) involved in the perfor- mance of any memory task. Second, “The brain regions operative during explicit or implicit memory do not divide on consciousness per se” (Dew & Cabeza, 2011, p. 185). Cabeza et al. (2018) proposed a component-process model resembling that of Dew and Cabeza (2011). This model assumes that processing is very flexible and depends heavily on process-specific alliances (PSAs) or mini- networks. According to Cabeza et al., “A PSA is a small team of brain regions that rapidly assemble to mediate a cognitive process in response to task demands but quickly disassemble when the process is no longer needed . . . PSAs are flexible, temporary, and opportunistic” (p. 996). Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["(task-negative; in blue).","From Kim & Voss (2019)."]}

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nLong-term memory systems 339 Ferbinteanu (2019) proposed a dynamic network model based on very similar assumptions. A major motivation for this theoretical approach was neuroimaging evidence. Here is an example involving the left angular gyrus in the parietal lobe. This region is involved in both the recollection of episodic memories and numerous tasks requiring semantic processing (see Figure 7.19). Moscovitch et al. (2016) pointed out that the hippocampus’s connections to several other brain areas (e.g., those involved in visual perception) suggests it is not only involved in episodic memory. Consider research on boundary exten- sion: “the . . . tendency to reconstruct a scene with a larger background than actu- ally was presented” (Moscovitch et al., 2016, p. 121). Boundary extension is accompanied by hippocampal activation and is greatly reduced in amnesic patients with hippocampal damage. McCormick et al. (2018) reviewed research on patients with damage to the hippocampus. Such patients mostly showed decreased future thinking and impaired scene construction, navigation and moral decision-making as well as impaired episodic memory. McCormick et al. also reviewed research on patients with damage to the ventromedial prefron- tal cortex (centrally involved in schema processing in semantic memory), which is also connected to several other brain areas. Such patients had decreased future thinking and impaired scene construction, navigation and emotion regulation. Evaluation The component-process approach has several strengths. First, there is compelling evidence that processes associated with different memory systems combine very flexibly on numerous memory tasks. This flexibility depends on the precise task demands (e.g., processes necessary early in learning may be less so subsequently) and on individual differences in learning/memory skills and previous knowledge. In other words, we use whatever processes (and asso- ciated brain areas) are most useful for the current learning or memory task. Figure 7.18 A three-dimensional model of memory: (1) conceptually or perceptually driven; (2) relational or item stimulus representation; (3) controlled or automatic/involuntary intention. The brain areas are the visual cortex (Vis Ctx), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), hippocampus (Hipp), rhinal cortex (RhC) and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (L VL PFC).

It can account for the fact that many more brain areas are typically active during most memory tasks than expected from the traditional approach. Third, the component-process approach has encouraged researchers to abandon the traditional approach of studying memory as an isolated mental function. For example, processes associated with episodic memory are also involved in scene construction, aspects of decision-making, navigation, imagining the future and empathy (McCormick et al., 2018; Moscovitch et al., 2016). More generally, “The border between memory and percep- tion/action has become more blurred” (Ferbinteanu, 2019, p. 74). What are the limitations of the component-process approach? First, it does not provide a detailed model. This makes it hard to make specific pre- dictions concerning the precise combination of processes individuals will use on any given memory task. Second, our ability to create process-specific alliances rapidly and efficiently undoubtedly depends on our previous experiences and various forms of learning (Ferbinteanu, 2019). However, the nature of such learn- ing remains unclear. Third, as Moscovitch et al. (2016, p. 125) pointed out, “Given that PSAs are rapidly assembled and disassembled, they require a mechanism that can quickly control communication between distant brain regions.” Moscovitch et al. argued the prefrontal cortex is centrally involved, but we have very limited evidence concerning its functioning. Fourth, process-specific alliances are typically mini-networks involving two or three brain regions. However, as we have seen, some research has suggested the involvement of larger brain networks consisting of numer- ous brain regions (e.g., Kim & Voss, 2019). The optimal network size for explaining learning and memory remains unclear. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. The notion there are several memory systems is very influential. Within that approach, the crucial distinction is between declarative memory (involving conscious recollection) and non- declarative memory (not involving conscious recollection). This distinction has received strong support from amnesic patients with severely impaired declarative memory but almost intact non- declarative memory. Declarative memory is divided into semantic and episodic/autobiographical memory, whereas non-declarative memory is divided into priming and skill learning or procedural memory. • Declarative memory. Evidence from patients supports the distinction between episodic and semantic memory. Amnesic patients with damage to the medial temporal lobes including the hippocampus typically have more extensive impairment of episodic than semantic memory. In contrast, patients with semantic dementia (involving damage to the anterior temporal lobes) have KEY TERM Boundary extension Misremembering a scene as having a larger surround area than was actually the case.

However, a complicating factor is that many memory tasks involve combining episodic and semantic memory processes. Another complicating factor is semanticisation (transformation of episodic memories into semantic ones over time): perceptual details within episodic memory are lost over time and there is increased reliance on gist and schematic information within semantic memory. • Episodic memory. Episodic memory is often assessed by recognition tests. Recognition memory can involve familiarity or recollection. Evidence supports the binding-of-item-and-context model: familiarity judgements depend on perirhinal cortex whereas recollection judgements depend on binding what and where information in the hippocampus. In similar fashion, free recall can involve familiarity or recollection with the latter being associated with better recall of contextual information. Episodic memory is basically constructive rather than reproductive, and so we remember mostly the gist of our past experiences. Constructive processes associated with episodic memory are used to imagine future events. However, imaging future events relies more heavily on semantic memory than does recalling past events. Episodic memory is also used in divergent creative thinking. • Semantic memory. Most objects can be described at the superordinate, basic and subordinate levels. Basic level categories are typically used in everyday life. However, categorisation is often faster at the superordinate level than the basic level because less information processing is required. According to Barsalou’s situated simulation theory, concept processing involves perceptual and motor information. However, it is unclear whether perceptual and motor information are both necessary and sufficient for concept understanding (e.g., patients with damage to the motor system can understand action-related words). Concepts have an abstract central core of meaning de-emphasised by Barsalou. According to the hub-and-spoke model, concepts consist of hubs (unified abstract representations) and spokes (modality- specific information). The existence of patients with category- specific deficits supports the notion of spokes. Evidence from patients with semantic dementia indicates hubs are stored in the anterior temporal lobes. It is unclear how information from hubs and spokes is combined and integrated. Schemas are stored in semantic memory with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex being especially involved in schema processing. Patients with damage to that brain area often have greater impairments in schema knowledge than concept knowledge. In contrast, patients with semantic dementia (damage to the anterior temporal lobes) have greater impairments in concept knowledge than schema knowledge. Thus, there is some evidence for a double dissociation.

Priming often depends on enhanced neural efficiency shown by repetition suppression of brain activity. Skill learning occurs slowly and generalises to stimuli not presented during learning. Amnesic patients (with hippocampal damage) typically have fairly intact performance on priming and skill learning but severely impaired declarative memory. In contrast, Parkinson’s patients (with striatal damage) exhibit the opposite pattern. Amnesic and Parkinson’s patients provide only an approximate double dissociation. Complications arise because some tasks can be performed using either declarative or non-declarative memory, because different memory systems sometimes interact during learning, and because non-declarative learning often involves networks consisting of several brain areas. • Beyond memory systems and declarative vs non-declarative memory. The traditional emphasis on the distinction between declarative and non-declarative memory is oversimplified. It does not fully explain amnesics’ memory deficits and exaggerates the relevance of whether processing is conscious or not. Henke’s model (with its emphasis on processes rather than memory systems) provides an account that is superior to the traditional approach. According to the component-process model, memory involves numerous brain areas and processes used in flexible combinations rather than a much smaller number of rigid memory systems. This model has great potential. However, it is hard to make specific predictions about the combinations of processes individuals will use on any given memory task.

In this chapter, we focus on topics rarely researched until approximately 50 years ago but arguably even more directly relevant to our everyday lives. Two such topics are autobiographical memory and prospective memory, which are both strongly influenced by our everyday goals and motives. This is very clear with prospective memory (remember- ing to carry out intended actions). Our intended actions assist us to achieve our current goals. For example, if you have agreed to meet a friend at 10 am, you need to remember to set off at the appropriate time to achieve that goal. The other main topic discussed in this chapter is eyewitness testimony. Such research has obvious applied value with respect to the judicial system. However, most research on eyewitness testimony has been conducted in laboratory settings. Thus, it would be wrong to distinguish sharply between laboratory research and everyday memory or applied research. In spite of what has been said so far, everyday memory sometimes differs from more traditional memory research in various ways. First, social factors are often important in everyday memory (e.g., a group of friends discuss some event or holiday they have shared together). In contrast, participants in traditional memory research typically learn and remember information on their own. Second, participants in traditional memory experiments are generally motivated to be as accurate as possible. In contrast, everyday memory research is typically based on the notion that “Remembering is a form of purposeful action” (Neisser, 1996, p. 204). This approach involves three assumptions about everyday memory: (1) It is purposeful (i.e., motivated). (2) It has a personal quality about it, meaning it is influenced by the indi- vidual’s personality and other characteristics.

Chapter 8 Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nEveryday memory 345 (3) It is influenced by situational demands (e.g., the wish to impress one’s audience). The essence of Neisser’s (1996) argument is this: what we remember in everyday life is determined by our personal goals, whereas what we remem- ber in traditional memory research is mostly determined by the experi- menter’s demands for accuracy. Sometimes we strive for maximal memory accuracy in our everyday life (e.g., during an examination), but that is typically not our main goal. Findings Evidence that the memories we report in everyday life are sometimes delib- erately distorted was reported by Brown et al. (2015). They found 58% of students admitted to having “borrowed” other people’s personal memories when describing experiences that had allegedly happened to them. This was often done to entertain or impress an audience. If what you say about an event is deliberately distorted, does this change the memory itself? It often does. Dudokovic et al. (2004) asked people to recall a story accurately (as in traditional memory research) or entertainingly (as in the real world). Unsurprisingly, entertaining retellings were more emotional but contained fewer details. The participants were then instructed to recall the story accurately. Those who had previously recalled it entertainingly recalled fewer details and were less accurate than those who previously recalled it accurately. This exemplifies the saying-is-believing effect – tailoring what one says about an event to suit a given audience causes inaccuracies in memory for that event. Further evidence of the saying-is-believing effect was reported by Hellmann et al. (2011). Participants saw a video of a pub brawl involv- ing two men. They then described the brawl to a student having previously been told this student believed person A was (or was not) the culprit. The participants’ retelling of the event reflected the student’s biased views. On a subsequent unexpected test of free recall for the crime event, participants’ recall was systematically influenced by their earlier retelling. Free recall was most distorted in those participants whose retelling of the event had been most biased. What should be done? Research on human memory should ideally possess ecological validity (i.e., applicability to real life; see Glossary). Ecological validity has two aspects: (1) representativeness (the naturalness of the experimental situation and task); and (2) generalisability (the extent to which a study’s findings apply to the real world). It is often (mistakenly) assumed that everyday memory research has greater ecological validity than traditional laboratory research. This is simply incorrect. Generalisability is more important than representative- ness (Kvavilashvili & Ellis, 2004). Laboratory research is generally carried out under well-controlled conditions and very often produces findings that KEY TERM Saying-is-believing effect Tailoring a message about an event to suit a given audience causes subsequent inaccuracies in memory for that event.

Indeed, the fact that the level of experimental control is generally higher in laboratory research than in more naturalistic research means that the findings obtained often have greater generalisabil- ity. Laboratory research also often satisfies the criterion of representative- ness because the experimental situation captures key features of the real world. In sum, the distinction between traditional laboratory research and everyday memory research is blurred and indistinct. In practice, there is much cross-fertilisation, with the insights from both kinds of memory research enhancing our understanding of human memory. AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY: INTRODUCTION We have hundreds of thousands of memories relating to an endless variety of things. However, those relating to the experiences we have had and those of other people important to us have special significance and form our autobiographical memory (memory for the events of one’s own life). What is the relationship between autobiographical memory and epi- sodic memory (concerned with events at a given time in a specific place; see Chapter 7)? One important similarity is that both types of memory relate to personally experienced events. In addition, both are susceptible to proactive and retroactive interference and unusual or distinctive events are especially well remembered. There are also several differences between them. First, autobiograph- ical memory typically relates to events of personal significance whereas episodic memory (sometimes called “laboratory memory”) often relates to trivial events (e.g., was the word chair presented in the first list?). As a con- sequence, autobiographical memories are often thought about more often than episodic ones. They also tend to be more organised than episodic memories because they relate to the self. Second, neuroimaging evidence suggests autobiographical memory is more complex and involves more brain regions than episodic memory. Andrews-Hanna et al. (2014) carried out a meta-analysis (see Glossary) of studies on autobiographical memory, episodic memory and mentalis- ing (understanding the mental states of oneself and others) (see Figure 8.1). Episodic memory retrieval involved medial temporal regions (includ- ing the hippocampus) whereas mentalising involved the dorsal medial regions (including the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex). Of most impor- tance, the brain regions associated with autobiographical memory over- lapped with those associated with episodic memory and mentalising. Thus, autobiographical memory seems to involve both episodic memory and mentalising. Third, some people have large discrepancies between their auto- biographical and episodic memory (Roediger & McDermott, 2013). For example, Patihis et al. (2013) found individuals with exceptionally good autobiographical memory had only average episodic memory performance when recalling information learned under laboratory conditions (see below). Fourth, the role of motivation differs between autobiographical and episodic memory (Marsh & Roediger, 2012). We are much more inter- ested in our own personal history than episodic memories formed in the KEY TERMS Autobiographical memory Long-term memory for the events of one’s own life.

In contrast, we are motivated to recall labora- tory episodic memories accurately. Fifth, some aspects of autobiographical memory involve semantic memory (general knowledge; see Glossary) rather than epi- sodic memory (Prebble et al., 2013). For example, we know where and when we were born but this is not based on episodic memory! Further evidence for the involve- ment of semantic memory in autobiographi- cal memory comes from research on amnesic patients (Juskenaite et al., 2016). They have little or no episodic memory but can never- theless recall much information about them- selves (e.g., aspects of their own personality). Eustache et al. (2016) distinguished between episodic and semantic autobio- graphical memory. Both forms of autobio- graphical memory involve personal memories, but the latter differ from the former because they lack any subjective sense of recollection. Eustache et al. reviewed neuroimaging research supporting the above distinction. Episodic autobiographical memory was associated with activa- tion in the occipital cortex and lateral parietal cortex. In contrast, seman- tic autobiographical memory was associated with activation in the middle and inferior frontal cortex. Other brain areas (e.g., the lateral temporal cortex; the hippocampus) were activated by both forms of autobiograph- ical memory. More research indicating that autobiographical memories vary in their relationship to episodic and semantic memory is discussed in Chapter 7 (e.g., research of Renoult et al., 2016; see p. 303). What are the main functions of autobiographical memory? Bluck and Alea (2009) identified three key reasons: (1) social function: bonding with others (e.g., shared memories); (2) directive function: using the past as a guide to the future; (3) self-function: creating a sense of self-continuity over time. Vranić et al. (2018) obtained support for all three functions in a questionnaire- based approach. The social and self-functions were positively correlated with each other and there was some evidence these functions were more important than the directive function. Demiray and Janssen (2013) identified an additional function: self- enhancement. Most people feel closer to their positive memories than their negative ones, and this effect is stronger among individuals having high self-esteem. Below we discuss major topics within autobiographical memory. First, we consider unusually vivid autobiographical memories for dramatic per- sonal or world events. Second, we focus on those periods in individuals’ Figure 8.1 Brain regions activated by autobiographical, episodic retrieval and mentalising tasks including regions of episodic (green); mentalising (blue); autobiographical (red-brown); episodic + mentalising (blue/green); episodic + autobiographical (yellow); mentalising + autobiographical (purple); all 3 (white).

Note that research on autobiographical memories for traumatic childhood events is discussed in Chapter 7. IN THE REAL WORLD: HIGHLY SUPERIOR AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY (HSAM) Many people bemoan their deficient autobiographical memories. However, a few individuals have remarkably efficient autobiographical memory. Consider Jill Price (see photo). She has an incredible ability to recall detailed information about almost every day of her life and thus possesses what is known as highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM). You may envy Jill Price’s phenomenal autobiographical memory. However, she regards it as a disadvantage: “I call it a burden. I run my entire life through my head every day and it drives me crazy!!!” (Parker et al., 2006, p. 35). Strangely, her memory generally is very ordinary (e.g., recalling word lists). You can see Jill Price on YouTube: “The Woman Who Could Not Forget – Jill Price”. Why is her autobiographical memory so outstanding? First, she has obsessional tendencies and focuses excessively on her personal past. As she said, “This is OCD [obsessive-compulsive disorder]. I have OCD of my memories.” Second, she has poor inhibitory processes and so finds it very hard to switch off her personal memories. Third, she makes time seem more concrete by representing it in spatial form (e.g., positions on a circle). More recent research (e.g., LePort et al., 2012, 2016; Santangelo et al., 2018) indicates the great majority of individuals with HSAM possess similar obsessional characteristics to Jill Price. Indeed, they often have as many obsessional symptoms as patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Jill Price Dan Tuffs/Getty Images.

LePort et al. (2016) found individuals with HSAM had comparable autobiographical memory to controls one week after an event. However, they were dramatically better than controls thereafter (see Figure 8.2). These findings suggest the memory differences between the two groups depended mainly on processes occurring after acquisition (e.g., consolidation; frequent rehearsal) rather than encoding at the time of the event. Santangelo et al. (2018) found that individuals with HSAM retrieved autobiographical memories (but not other memories) much faster than controls. During retrieval of autobiographical memories, twice as many brain areas were activated in HSAM individuals as controls and they had enhanced connectivity between brain areas important in memory retrieval. Some individuals with HSAM may have brains differing from those of other people (Palombo et al., 2018). LePort et al. (2012) found that HK (a man with HSAM) had a larger right amygdala than most people and enhanced connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus. This could be important because the amygdala is involved in emotional processing and the hippocampus is crucial to forming long-term memories. However, such brain differences may be a consequence (rather than cause) of remarkable autobiographical memory. KEY TERMS Highly superior auto- biographical memory (HSAM) Exceptional ability to recall autobiographical memories in detail, generally accompanied by only average ability to recall other memories. Flashbulb memories Vivid and detailed personal memories of dramatic events (e.g., 9/11). Flashbulb memories Most people believe they have extremely clear and long-lasting memories for their personal experiences following important and dramatic public events (e.g., the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001). Such memories were termed flashbulb memories by Brown and Kulik (1977). They claimed dramatic events perceived as surprising and as having real consequences for the individual (making them of relevance to autobiographical memory) activate a special neural mechanism which “prints” the details of such events permanently in memory. Brown and Kulik (1977) argued the following information is typically included in flashbulb memories: ● informant (person who supplied the information); ● place where the news was heard; ● ongoing event; ● individual’s own emotional state; ● emotional state of others; ● consequences of the event for the individual. Findings Sharot et al. (2007) compared the memories of individuals close to the World Trade Centre (about 2 miles) on 9/11 with those somewhat further away (about 4½ miles) three years afterwards. The flash- bulb memories of those close to the event were more vivid and detailed and involved more activation of the amygdala (strongly involved in emotion). These findings suggest it may require intense emotional experience to produce genuine flashbulb memories. World Trade Center attacks on 9/11. Tammy KLEIN/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\n350 Memory Support for the involvement of the amygdala was reported by Spanel et al. (2018). Recall of flashbulb memories was much worse in patients with damage to the amygdala than those without damage to that brain area. Flashbulb memories not based on an intense emotional experience are often surprisingly inaccurate. For example, videotape of the first plane striking the first tower on 9/11 was not available on the day it happened. However, 73% of those questioned said they had seen it on that day (Pezdek, 2003)! Their memories were distorted because videotape of the second tower being hit was available on the day itself. Hirst et al. (2015) studied flashbulb memories and event memories (memories for facts associated with events causing flashbulb memories) of 9/11 over a 10-year period. There was rapid forgetting for both types of memories within the first year after 9/11 but very little thereafter. Of inter- est, participants had very high confidence in the accuracy of their flashbulb memories despite considerable forgetting. Rimmele et al. (2012) studied the consistency of flashbulb memories (i.e., lack of change) over time. There was high consistency between one week and three years after 9/11 for remembering the location at which par- ticipants heard about the event (83%), but lower consistency for informant (70%), ongoing activity (62%) and their own immediate reaction (34%). In spite of much inconsistency in individuals’ flashbulb memories, these memories are generally associated with high confidence levels. Talarico and Rubin (2003) found flashbulb memories for 9/11 showed no more consist- ency over a 32-week period than did everyday memories but the reported vividness of flashbulb memories was much greater. Why are confidence levels so high? Day and Ross (2014) assessed flash- bulb memories for Michael Jackson’s death. Participants having a strong social bond with Michael Jackson had greater confidence in the accuracy of their flashbulb memories than those with a weak social bond, because they experienced Jackson’s death with greater emotional intensity and also rehearsed the event more often. However, memory consistency was not influenced by social bond, emotional intensity or rehearsal. Conclusions Most findings suggest flashbulb memories are not special except perhaps when their formation is associated with high emotion. Most flashbulb mem- ories exhibit forgetting and/or distortions resembling those found with ordi- nary memories (Hirst & Phelps, 2016). However, such memories may be more detailed and long-lasting if the relevant event directly affected their lives (Sharot et al., 2007; see Chapter 15). Flashbulb memories are associated with excessively high levels of confidence in their accuracy for various reasons (e.g., the intensity of emotional experience involved; rehearsal: Day & Ross, 2014). Excellent memory for the location at which individuals heard about the traumatic event may cause them to exaggerate the accuracy of their flashbulb memo- ries (Rimmele et al., 2012). Finally, there are interesting links between flashbulb memories and flashbacks (“the intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic experiences in the present”: Brewin, 2015, p. 1).

With such research, it is possible to assess individuals’ immediate cognitive and emotional reactions to the traumatic event, which cannot be done when studying flashbulb memories. MEMORIES ACROSS THE LIFETIME Suppose we ask 70-year-olds to recall personal memories suggested by cue words (e.g., nouns referring to common objects). From which points in their lives would most memories come? Rubin et al. (1986) answered this question by combining findings from several studies. Two findings were of theoretical interest: ● Infantile amnesia (or childhood amnesia) shown by the almost total lack of memories from the first three years of life. ● Reminiscence bump, consisting of a surprisingly large number of mem- ories coming from the years between 10 and 30 (especially between 15 and 25). Infantile amnesia Adults sometimes claim their first autobiographical memory dates back to 2 years of age or earlier but such memories are typically fictional (Akhtar et al., 2018). Adults’ genuine first memories rarely date back to earlier than 2½ or 3 years of age and they also show limited recall for events occurring between 3 and 6 (see Figure 8.3). How can we explain this phenomenon (infantile amnesia or childhood amnesia)? Freud famously (notoriously?) attributed it to repression, with threat-related thoughts and experiences being consigned to the unconscious (see Chapter 6). This dramatic theory does not explain why adults cannot remember positive and neutral events from early childhood. Psychological theories Howe and Courage (1997) argued the development of the cognitive self (self-awareness) occurs during the second year of life. This plays an impor- tant role in the end of infantile amnesia and the onset of autobiographical memory. The reason is that possession of a cognitive self provides a frame- work for the organisation of autobiographical memories. The social-cultural developmental theory (e.g., Fivush, 2010) provides an alternative account, according to which language and culture are both central to autobiographical memory development. Language is important because we use it to communicate our memories. Experiences occurring before children develop language are hard to express in language later on. Evidence indicating the importance of language was reported by Jack et al. (2009): the age of first recalled memory was earlier in adolescents whose mothers reminisced elaborately about the past with their children. Jack and Hayne (2010) argued the common assumption of a gradual decline in infantile amnesia is incorrect. In their study, adults’ KEY TERMS Infantile amnesia The inability of adults to recall autobiographical memories from early childhood; also known as childhood amnesia.

These find- ings suggest infantile amnesia is a two-stage process: (1) absolute amnesia for the first two years of life; and (2) relative amnesia for the remaining preschool years. How can we account for these two stages? According to Jack and Hayne (2010), abso- lute amnesia ends with the onset of the cogni- tive self (consistent with Howe and Courage’s theory). The subsequent strong tendency for information recalled about childhood events to increase as the individual’s age at the time increases probably reflects children’s rapid development of language in early life (con- sistent with Fivush’s theory). Hippocampal neurogenesis Infantile amnesia has been observed in all altricial species (those showing considera- ble post-birth development). Such infantile amnesia cannot be explained with reference to notions such as the cognitive self or language development. However, it can potentially be explained by processes occurring within the hippocampus (crucially involved in declar- ative memory including autobiographical memory). We need to focus on hippocampal neurogenesis, a process in which new neurons are generated within the hippocampus (especially the dentate gyrus) early in development. According to Josselyn and Frankland (2012, p. 423), “High neurogenesis levels negatively regulate the ability to form enduring memories, most likely by replacing synaptic connections in pre-existing hippocampal memory circuits.” Madsen and Kim (2016) reviewed evidence indicating the importance of hippocampal neurogenesis in producing infantile amnesia. For example, long-term retrieval in mice was impaired when drugs increased hippocam- pal neurogenesis. In contrast, long-term retrieval was enhanced when drugs reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. Travaglia et al. (2016) found rats during the infantile amnesia period formed lasting (but relatively inacces- sible) memories. However, when activity in the hippocampus was blocked prior to learning, such memories were not acquired. Finally, Travaglia et al. showed that changing patterns of activation in the hippocampus signalled the end of the infantile amnesia period. Forgetting Defining “infantile amnesia” on the basis of adults’ inability to recall auto- biographical memories from the earliest years of life can lead to the erroneous Figure 8.3 Childhood amnesia based on data reported by Rubin and Schulkind (1997). Participants (20, 35 and 70 years of age) reported very few autobiographical memories before the age of 3 and there was later a levelling off between the ages of 7 and 10.

A simple explanation of infantile amnesia is that young children form auto- biographical memories but these memories are very susceptible to forgetting. Supporting evidence was reported by Tustin and Hayne (2016). Three- year-old children learned how to operate a train and their memory for this event was tested after 1 day and 1 year. They exhibited accurate memory (including verbal autobiographical memory) on both tests and there was no effect of retention interval. However, the children’s memories of the event contained only a few details which may help to explain why most early memories cannot be recalled by adults. Overall evaluation Infantile amnesia depends on several factors (see Howe, 2019, for a review). Absolute amnesia can probably be explained by hippocampal neurogene- sis. After that, the onset of autobiographical memory in infants probably depends on reductions in hippocampal neurogenesis plus the emergence of the cognitive self. Its subsequent expression depends heavily on social and cultural factors and children’s language development and possibly also on their development of semantic memory. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, most research has focused on adults’ inability to recall autobiographical memories from the first three years of life. It is generally unclear whether this inability is due to severely deficient initial encoding of such memories, to difficulties in retrieval or both. Second, most research is correlational making it hard to establish causality (e.g., the finding that the end of infantile amnesia occurs around the time the cognitive self emerges does not prove the latter causes the former). Reminiscence bump As mentioned earlier, older people asked to produce personal memo- ries recall numerous events from adolescence and early childhood (the reminiscence bump). Conway et al. (2005) found a reminiscence bump in older individuals in five countries (America, China, Japan, England and Bangladesh). Of interest, the Chinese (with a collectivistic culture emphasis- ing group cohesion) were most likely to recall events with a social or group orientation. In contrast, the Americans (with an individualistic culture emphasising personal responsibility and achievement) were most likely to recall events relating to themselves. It has typically been assumed (incorrectly) there is a single reminis- cence bump. Koppel & Berntsen (2015) carried out a meta-analysis using two techniques to assess the reminiscence bump: (1) cue-word method in which individuals generate memories to cue words; (2) the important memories method in which individuals report important personal memories. Their key findings were as follows (see Figure 8.4). First, the midpoint of the reminiscence bump was 15.5 years using cue words but 21.5 for important Interactive exercise: Reminiscence bump Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["process of generating new neurons in the hippocampus during early development.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32."]}

Second, the reminiscence bump was much stronger using the important memories method. How can we explain the reminiscence bump(s)? One influential approach is Rubin and Berntsen’s (2003) theory based on the notion of a life script (cultural expectations about the major life events in most people’s lives). Examples include falling in love, marriage and having children. Most such events occur between the ages of 15 and 30. According to the theory, the life script guides and organises the retrieval of autobiographical memories. Several predictions from the life-script account have been supported. First, most life events are emotionally positive, and so we would expect to find a reminiscence bump only for positive events. That is precisely what Berntsen et al. (2011) found. As expected, the positive events recalled were rated as much more central to the participants’ life story than the nega- tive ones. Second, there was no reminiscence bump for positive events not forming part of the life script (Berntsen et al.).

Most positive events forming part of the life script involve major transitions (e.g., going to college; marriage; having children). Evidence transitions not directly forming part of the life script are important were reported by Enz et al. (2016). Older adults recalled autobiographical events occurring between the ages of 40 and 60. Many events recalled occurred close in time to the major transition of a residential move: a relocation bump. Thus, autobiographical memories associated with transitions (even if not part of the life script) seem to be especially easy to recall, perhaps because such memories tend to be novel and distinctive. Why does the reminiscence bump depend on the method used? It has been argued (Koppel & Berntsen, 2016) that the crucial difference between the cue word and important memories methods is the retrieval strategy used. Koppel and Berntsen (2016) asked students (mean age = 23) to gen- erate the autobiographical memories they imagined a hypothetical 70-year- old would produce. With the important memories method, the timing and nature of the reminiscence bump were strikingly similar for imagined important memories and those of actual 70-year-olds. Similar (but much less striking) findings were obtained when compar- ing imagined and actual memories using the cue-word method. Koppel and Berntsen (2016) concluded the different reminiscence bumps pro- duced using the two methods “are largely produced by general schematic processes operative at retrieval” (p. 97). In sum, the reminiscence bump produced using the important memo- ries method depends on the life script and its associated cultural expecta- tions. In addition, it is probably relevant that major life events generally involve important transitions. In contrast, memories recalled using the cue-word method are much less influenced by the life script (Koppel & Berntsen, 2015). The finding (Koppel & Berntsen, 2016) that imagined memories differed substantially from actual ones using that method sug- gests specifically memory-based processes underlie the reminiscence bump associated with that method. THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY Many theories of autobiographical memory have been proposed over the years. Here we will focus mainly on Conway and Pleydell-Pearce’s (2000) self-memory system model and its subsequent development. Then, we discuss how cognitive neuroscience has contributed to our understanding of autobiographical memory. Self-memory system model Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) argued we possess a self-memory system having two major components: (1) Autobiographical memory knowledge base: this contains personal information at three levels of specificity: Research activity: Memory for personal events Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["tions concerning the nature and order of a typical person’s major life events.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32."]}

Different lifetime periods often overlap in time (e.g., living with someone may overlap with having a particular job). ● General events: these include repeated events (e.g., visits to a sports club) and single events (e.g., a holiday in Botswana). General events are often related to each other and to lifetime periods. ● Event-specific knowledge: this consists of images, feelings and other details relating to general events and spanning time periods from seconds to hours. Event knowledge is usually organised in the correct temporal order. (2) Working self: this is concerned with the self, what it may become and the individual’s current goals. The working self’s goals influence the memories stored within the autobiographical memory knowl- edge base and the autobiographical memories we recall. As a result, “Autobiographical memories are primarily records of success or failure in goal attainment” (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000, p. 266). According to the theory, autobiographical memories can be accessed in two ways. First, there is generative retrieval which involves deliberately con- structing autobiographical memories by applying the working self to infor- mation in the autobiographical memory knowledge base. Second, there is direct retrieval: autobiographical memories are triggered effortlessly or “automatically” by specific cues (e.g., hearing the word Paris may trigger retrieval of a holiday there). It was predicted recalled autobiographical memories would mostly be goal-relevant regardless of retrieval mode. However, events relating to current goals are more likely to be recalled with generative retrieval (which involves top-down processes) than with direct retrieval (which typically depends on bottom-up processes triggered by environmental cues). Conway (2005) developed the above theory (see Figure 8.5). The knowledge structures divided into the conceptual self and episodic memo- ries (previously called event-specific knowledge). At the top of the hierar- chy, the life story and themes have been added. The life story consists of very general factual and evaluative knowledge we possess about ourselves and themes referring to major life domains (e.g., work; relationships). Conway (2005) argued we want our autobiographical memories to exhibit coherence (consistency with our current goals and beliefs). However, we also often want them to exhibit correspondence (accuracy). Over time, coherence tends to win out over correspondence. Conway (2009) refined the theory. He argued the working self consists of the individual’s goal system (goals; plans; projects) plus their concep- tual self. It determines which autobiographical memories can be accessed. In addition, it is assumed that simple episodic memories resembling each other often form complex episodic memories. Finally, Conway et al. (2016) developed the notion of episodic memories within the self-memory system. They identified a remembering– imagining KEY TERMS Generative retrieval Deliberate or voluntary construction of autobiographical memories based on an individual’s current goals; see direct retrieval.

This system “serves the purpose of integrating past, current, and future goal-related activities” (p. 256). Participants listed all the personal events they could remember from the past 5 days and events they imagined were likely to occur over the next 5 days. The findings were as predicted (see Figure 8.6). Findings Research on patients with retrograde amnesia (widespread forgetting of events preceding brain injury; see Chapter 7) supports the notion there are different types of autobiographical knowledge. These patients often have greater difficulties recalling episodic memories than general events and life- time periods (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). For example, Rosenbaum et al. (2005) found an amnesic patient (KC) with no episodic memories could nevertheless access some general autobiographical knowledge.

(2017) found amnesic patients were more likely than healthy controls to recall frequently occurring events. This probably happened because it is easier to use semantic memory processes to recall general rather than unique events. McCormick et al. (2018) supported this viewpoint in a review. Amnesic patients use brain areas associated with retrieval of general or schematic information (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex; see Chapter 7) when retrieving autobiographical memories. According to the self-memory system model, the accessibility of auto- biographical memories depends on individuals’ goals. Woike et al. (1999) compared individuals with an agentic personality type (motivated by inde- pendence, achievement and personal power) and those with a communal personality type (motivated by interdependence and similarity to others). When they recalled a positive personal memory, 65% of agentic individuals recalled agentic memories (e.g., involving success) whereas 90% of com- munal individuals recalled communal memories (e.g., involving love or friendship). With negative personal memories, 47% of agentic individuals recalled agentic memories whereas 90% of communal individuals recalled communal memories. The model predicts faster recall of autobiographical memories with direct retrieval than generative retrieval. This prediction has support. Barzykowski and Staugaard (2016) both found direct retrieval was twice as fast as generative retrieval. According to the model, the individual’s working self and goals are more involved in generative than direct retrieval. Johannessen and Berntsen (2010) supported this assumption: memories elicited by generative retrieval were more significant and relevant to the individual’s personal identity than those involving direct retrieval. Addis et al. (2012) found generative retrieval was associated with more activation in prefrontal areas involved in strategic search for autobio- graphical information.

It has typically been assumed direct retrieval is involuntary whereas generative retrieval is voluntary. This assumption is oversimplified. Barzykowski and Staugaard (2016) distinguished between retrieval effort (high with generative retrieval and low with direct retrieval) and conscious intention (voluntary vs involuntary retrieval). They identified three types of autobiographical memories: (1) involuntary memories; (2) directly retrieved voluntary memories; and (3) generatively retrieved voluntary memories. According to the model, lifetime periods differ importantly from specific episodic memories. Various findings support this assumption (Thomsen, 2015). First, lifetime periods are regarded as more important than specific memories to an individual’s identity and personality. Second, memory for lifetime periods is less affected by ageing than specific memo- ries. Third, lifetime period memories are generally less vivid and emotional than specific memories and are associated with less activation in frontal areas and the medial temporal lobes (Ford et al., 2011). Evaluation The theoretical approach of Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) and Conway (2009) provides a comprehensive account of autobiographical memory. Several of their main theoretical assumptions (e.g., the hierar- chical structure of autobiographical memory; the intimate relationship between autobiographical memory and the self; the importance of goals in autobiographical memory) are well supported. There is also good support for the distinction between generative and direct retrieval. What are the limitations of the self-memory system model? First, we need to know more about how the working self interacts with the auto biographical knowledge base to produce recall of specific autobiographical memories. Second, autobiographical memories vary in how much episodic information (e.g., contextual details) and semantic information (e.g., world knowledge) they contain. This issue is not addressed fully within the model. Third, the distinction between direct and generative retrieval is oversimplified. Fourth, the model does not fully account for the complexities of autobiographical memory revealed by cognitive neuroscience studies (discussed next). Cognitive neuroscience The prefrontal cortex plays a major role in autobiographical memory retrieval (especially during generative retrieval). Svoboda et al. (2006) found in a meta-analytic review that the medial and ventromedial prefron- tal cortex was nearly always activated during autobiographical retrieval. Autobiographical memories are often of personally significant events and so are associated with emotion. The amygdala, buried deep within the temporal lobe, is strongly associated with emotion. As expected, amnesic patients who also have damage to the amygdala find it harder to retrieve emotional autobiographical memories (Buchanan et al., 2006). St. Jacques et al. (2011) found four brain networks (with strong bidirectional connections between them) were activated when individuals Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["ose they imagined were likely over the next 5 days.","From Conway et al."]}

Second, subse- quent elaborative processing of these memories involved strong connections between occipital-parietal areas and dorsal fronto-parietal regions. There was no sudden switch between the two processing stages: rather, the relative dominance of access-related and elaboration-related processing altered over time.

This assumption has been applied in studies on depressed individuals. Research has often involved participants recalling autobiographical memories of events lasting less than one day to word cues. Depressed individuals typically produce over-general negative memories (Fisk et al., 2019). For example, a depressed person might respond “Arguing with other people” to the cue “angry”. Most evidence shows only an association or correlation between over-general memories and depression and so does not demonstrate the former partially causes the latter. Stange et al. (2013) reported more convincing evidence. The extent of over-general autobiographical memory predicted increases in depressive symptoms 8 months later in those exposed to high levels of familial emotional abuse. Dalgleish et al. (2011) asked patients with current major depressive disorder, patients in remission from that disorder and healthy controls to list their most important lifetime periods. After that, the patients decided which positive and negative items (words or phrases) applied to each period. Four measures were identified: (1) the proportion of items that was negative; (2) compartmentalisation (the extent to which the proportion of items that was negative varied across lifetime periods); (3) positive redundancy (the extent to which the same positive terms were used across periods); (4) negative redundancy (the extent to which the same negative terms were used across periods).

In addition, current patients had a less integrated sense of self (i.e., greater compartmentalisation). This occurred in part because current depressed patients showed little consistency in their use of positive terms across lifetime periods (i.e., low positive redundancy). Finally, depressed patients in remission were intermediate between current patients and controls on most measures. What do these findings mean? First, the organisation of autobiographical knowledge in currently depressed patients is relevant to their working self (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). More generally, current patients’ perceived self is revealed in the predominantly negative and non- integrated structure of their autobiographical knowledge. Second, the structure of autobiographical knowledge is more integrated and less pervasively negative in patients in remission than current patients. Thus, recovery from major depressive disorder involves having a “healthier” perspective on one’s life history. Third, patients in remission nevertheless had a more negative and less integrated view of their life history than healthy controls. These findings suggest these patients were at risk of a subsequent depressive episode. Dalgleish and Werner-Seidler (2014) identified four cognitive biases in depression associated with autobiographical memory recall (see Figure 8.9). First, there is a strong tendency to recall negative autobiographical memories. Second, there is impoverished access to positive memories. Third, depressed individuals recall over-general negative memories. Fourth, depressed individuals have an altered relationship to their emotional memories in that they try (typically unsuccessfully) to avoid or suppress negative memories.

Some answers were discussed by Dalgleish and Werner-Seidler (2014). One approach is to use MEmory Specificity Training (MEST) where the emphasis is on training depressed patients to generate more specific autobiographical memories (e.g., for homework, patients produce specific memories to 10 cue words). MEST reduces rumination (repeated negative self-focused thoughts and images) and cognitive avoidance. Werner-Seidler et al. (2018) found in patients with major depressive disorder that MEST increased the specificity of their autobiographical memories and reduced their depressive symptoms. Hitchcock et al. (2016) used memory flexibility (MemFlex) training with individuals in remission from depression. This training focuses on the development of three important autobiographical memory skills: (1) Balancing involves enabling depressed individuals to recollect positive and negative, specific and general memories, with equal ease. (2) Elaboration focuses on allowing depressed individuals to store richer and more elaborative positive memories by focusing on emotional and situational details of such memories. (3) Flexibility involves training individuals to control whether the memories they recall are general or specific. They also learn to identify situations where specific memories are optimal (e.g., solving a problem) and those where general memories are optimal (e.g., when considering the strength of a friendship). Hitchcock et al. (2016) found MemFlex training increased the specificity of recalled autobiographical memories, reduced rumination and improved social problem solving. IN THE REAL WORLD: IS EYEWITNESS CONFIDENCE TRUSTWORTHY? In the United States, over 200 individuals convicted on the basis of mistaken eyewitness identification have been proved innocent by DNA tests. Garrett (2011) reviewed 161 such cases and discovered virtually all the mistaken eyewitnesses were certain at trial they had identified the culprit. These findings suggest we should ignore the confidence (or otherwise) eyewitnesses express in their identifications. However, that conclusion is not warranted. One case Garrett (2011) examined was that of Ronald Cotton. In 1985, he was found guilty of raping Jennifer Thompson because of her confident eyewitness identification of him as the culprit. However, he was exonerated by DNA evidence, after having spent over 10 years in prison. Of crucial importance, when Jennifer Thompson initially identified Cotton from a photo line-up, she hesitated for almost 5 minutes before eventually saying “I think this is the guy”. This case EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY Suppose you are the only eyewitness to a very serious crime. Subsequently the person you identify as the murderer on a line-up is found guilty although there is no other strong evidence. Is it safe to rely on eyewitness testimony? Simons and Chabris (2011) found 37% of Americans believe the testimony of a single confident eyewitness is sufficient to convict a criminal defendant. In fact, as we will see, eyewitness testimony can be very fallible.

Garrett (2011, p. 49) found “In 57% of trials transcripts (92 out of 161 cases), the witnesses reported they had not been certain at the time of their earlier identifications”. Why does eyewitness confidence often increase substantially from initial identification to courtroom? With Jennifer Thompson, positive feedback from the police following her initial identification caused her to become increasingly confident she had identified the culprit. Douglass and Steblay (2006) showed the importance of such feedback in a meta- analytic review. Eyewitnesses receiving confirming feedback after an identification (e.g., “Good, you identified the suspect”) believed mistakenly they had been very confident in the accuracy of their identification before receiving feedback: the “post- identification feedback effect”. In sum, two conclusions are warranted. First, we can generally trust eyewitnesses’ confidence in their identifications provided we focus on their initial level of confidence. Wixted et al. (2016) supported this conclusion in a large-scale real-life study of eyewitnesses’ initial identifications. When eyewitness confidence was low, only 20% of identifications were of the suspect. This increased dramatically to approximately 80% when their confidence was high. Second, “Testimony-relevant witness judgements should be collected and documented, preferably with videotape, before feedback can occur” (Steblay et al., 2014). Jennifer Thompson and Ronald Cotton.

Image provided courtesy of the PopTech Institute. Eyewitness memory is inaccurate for several reasons. We start with confirmation bias – eyewitnesses’ memory is influenced by their expec- tations. For example, Lindholm and Christianson (1998) found Swedish and immigrant students who saw a simulated robbery were twice as likely to select an innocent immigrant as an innocent Swede as the culprit. Participants’ expectations were influenced by the fact that immigrants are over-represented in Swedish crime statistics. Bartlett (1932) argued we have numerous schemas (packets of knowl- edge) in long-term memory strongly influencing what we remember (see Chapter 10). Most people’s bank-robbery schema includes information that robbers are typically male, wear disguises and have a getaway car with a driver (Tuckey & Brewer, 2003a). Tuckey and Brewer showed eye- witnesses a video of a simulated bank robbery. As predicted, eyewitnesses recalled information relevant to the bank-robbery schema better than irrel- evant information (e.g., the colour of the getaway car). Schemas can also cause memory distortions because we reconstruct an event’s details based on “what must have been true”. In a study by Tuckey and Brewer (2003b), some eyewitnesses saw a robber’s head covered by a balaclava (ski mask) so their gender was ambiguous. Eyewitnesses mostly interpreted the ambiguous information as being consistent with their bank-robbery schema. Thus, their recall was systematically distorted by including information from their bank-robbery schema.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nEveryday memory 365 Misinformation effect The most obvious reason why eyewitnesses’ memories are often inaccurate is that they fail to attend fully to the crime situation. After all, it typically occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. However, Loftus and Palmer (1974) emphasised a different reason – eyewitness memories are fragile and can easily be distorted by misleading information provided after the witnessed event: the misinformation effect. Findings Loftus and Palmer (1974) showed eyewitnesses a film of a car accident. Afterwards, some were asked “About how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other”. For other eyewitnesses, the word “hit” replaced “smashed into”. The estimated speed averaged 41 mph when the verb “smashed” was used versus 34 mph when “hit” was used. Thus, infor- mation implicit in the question influenced memory for the accident. One week later, all eyewitnesses were asked whether they had seen any broken glass. There was no broken glass, but 32% of those previously asked about speed using the verb “smashed” said they had seen broken glass compared to only 14% of those asked using the verb “hit”. A misinformation effect involving more directly misleading informa- tion was reported by Loftus et al. (1978). Eyewitnesses saw several slides, one showing a red Datsun car stopping at a stop or yield sign. Afterwards they were asked, “Did another car pass the red Datsun while it was stopped at the stop sign?” or the word “stop” was replaced by “yield”. In a third condition, the key question did not refer to a sign at all. Finally, the eye- witnesses decided which of two slides (car with a stop sign and car with a yield sign) they had seen previously. Eyewitness more often selected the wrong slide when the earlier question was misleading than when it was accurate or did not refer to the sign. Eyewitness memory can also be distorted by information presented before an event. Lindsay et al. (2004) showed eyewitnesses a video of a museum burglary. Eyewitnesses who had listened to a thematically similar narrative (a palace burglary) the previous day made many more errors when recalling information from the video than those who had listened to a thematically dissimilar narrative (a school trip to a palace). This finding is important because eyewitnesses often have relevant past experiences that may distort their memory for a crime. The misinformation effect has generally been found for peripheral or minor details (e.g., presence of broken glass in the study by Loftus and Palmer, 1974) rather than central ones. In similar fashion, Putnam et al. (2017) found the misinformation effect was much greater for relatively unmemorable than memorable details (see Figure 8.10). Putnam et al. (2017) pointed out that most textbook accounts assume the misinformation effect is nearly always found. However, they obtained contrary evidence. Misinformation led to enhanced recognition memory for an event when participants detected (and remembered) changes between that event and the post-event misinformation. What is happening here?

Theoretical accounts How does misleading information distort what eyewitnesses report? Is the original memory permanently altered or does it still exist but is inaccessible? Loftus (1979) argued misinformation causes the previously formed memory of an event to be “overwritten” and destroyed. Loftus (1992) argued for a less extreme position – the original memory remains but eyewitnesses “accept” misinformation as forming part of the event memory. Edelson et al. (2011) had eyewitnesses watch a crime scene in small groups and then recall the crime events three days later (Test 1). Four days later, they were misinformed their fellow eyewitnesses remembered several events differently from them. This was followed immediately by a memory test (Test 2) during which their brain activity was recorded. A week later, the eyewitnesses were told the answers allegedly given by their fellow eye- witnesses had been generated at random. Finally, they received another memory test (Test 3). Edelson et al. (2011) decided whether eyewitnesses pretended to agree with the group on Test 2 or whether their memories had genuinely changed by seeing if they maintained their incorrect answers on Test 3. Brain activ- ity during Test 2 indicated enhanced connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (both centrally involved in memory formation) was associated only with memories that had genuinely changed.

Oeberst and Blank (2012) argued misinformation does not cause per- manent alteration of memory traces of a witnessed event. According to them, the misinformation effect occurs because eyewitnesses are instructed to recall the single correct account of an event. Oeberst and Blank told eyewitnesses they had received contradictory information and encouraged them to recall everything from the event and the misinformation. This manipulation completely eliminated the misinformation effect! Thus, the original memory traces were essentially intact. Blank and Launay (2014) carried out a meta-analysis of studies on the misinformation effect where eyewitnesses were warned of the presence of misinformation after viewing an event. Post-warning reduced the mis- information effect to between one-third and one-half of its size when no warning was provided (see Figure 8.11). Higham et al. (2017) found the misinformation effect was eliminated when the post-warning was specific (i.e., it identified event details for which misinformation had been pre- sented earlier) but not when it was general (i.e., indicating there had been misinformation). One reason event memories are inaccessible is source misattribution (Johnson et al., 1993). In essence, a memory probe (e.g., question) acti- vates memory traces overlapping with it in information. Source misattri- bution is most likely when the memories from one source resemble those from a second source (e.g., Lindsay et al., 2004, discussed above, p. 366). Prull and Yockelson (2013) reported evidence suggesting the importance of source misattribution. The misinformation effect was much smaller when eyewitnesses received a source-recognition test encouraging them to retrieve source information.

However, some evidence supports the latter explanation (Edelson et al., 2011). Overall, the findings suggest the effects of misinformation on memory performance are not direct. Instead, memory performance is influ- enced flexibly by the precise strategies used by eyewitnesses to combine and integrate the information available to them. Other factors can also be involved (Wright & Loftus, 2008). One example is the vacant slot explanation (misinformation is more likely to be accepted when related information from the original event was not stored in memory). Another example is the blend explanation (misinformation and information from the original event are integrated in memory). Finally, the misinformation effect involves retroactive interference (see Glossary). Since retroactive interference with standard verbal memory tasks can be caused by several factors (see Chapter 6), it is unsurprising that the same is true of retroactive interference for criminal and other events. Weapon focus, anxiety and violence How do anxiety and violence influence eyewitness memory? There is evidence for the weapon focus effect – eyewitnesses attend to the criminal’s weapon, which reduces their memory for other information. For example, Biggs et al. (2013) found observers fixated weapons more than neutral objects and so faces were fixated less often in the weapon condition. Harada et al. (2015) found observers’ memory for peripheral stimuli was reduced in the presence of a weapon. This finding is consistent with Easterbrook’s (1959) hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, anxiety causes a narrowing of attention to central or important stimuli causing a reduction in individuals’ ability to remember peripheral details (see Chapter 15). Pickel (2009) pointed out that individuals often attend to stimuli that are unexpected in the current situation (inconsistent with their situational schema), which impairs their memory for other stimuli. She argued the weapon focus effect would be greater when the presence of a weapon was very unexpected. As predicted, the effect was especially strong when a criminal carrying a folding knife was female, because seeing a woman with a knife is unexpected. In similar fashion, the weapon focus effect was stronger when a male criminal carrying a handgun was white rather than black because of the mistaken stereotype linking black men with weapons. Fawcett et al. (2013) carried out a meta-analysis on the weapon focus effect. There was a moderate effect that was comparable in the laboratory and the real world. Peripheral details were often poorly remembered when the central object was unusual or unexpected in the current situation (even when the object was not a weapon). Fawcett et al. (2016) discussed studies showing the presence of a weapon made it harder for eyewitnesses to discriminate the culprit from innocent individuals on a line-up. It also increased the probability of making false identifications. How do stress and anxiety influence eyewitness memory? Deffenbacher et al. (2004) carried out a meta-analysis.

Thus, stress and anxiety generally impair eyewitness memory. Morgan et al. (2013) consid- ered the effects of very high stress. Military personnel endured a 3-minute stressful interrogation involving physical assault (e.g., slamming into a wall; facial slaps). Participants’ memory was generally poor and over 50% failed to identify their interrogator correctly. One reason stress impairs eyewitness memory is because it causes a narrowing of attention (see Easterbrook’s hypothesis discussed above). Yegiyan and Lang (2010) presented people with distressing pictures. As picture stressfulness increased, recognition memory for the central details improved progressively. In contrast, memory for peripheral details was much worse with highly stressful pictures than with moderately stress- ful ones. Thus, the findings supported Easterbrook’s hypothesis. Note, however, that “memory narrowing” is not always directly caused by “attentional narrowing” (see Chapter 15). Ageing and memory Older eyewitnesses’ memory is less accurate than that of younger adults and they exhibit greater misinformation effects. Jacoby et al. (2005) presented misleading information to younger and older adults. The older adults had a 43% chance of producing false memories at recall compared to only 4% for the younger adults. Older adults have impaired ability to use cognitive control effectively to focus retrieval on correct information (Keating et al., 2017) and are also less likely to monitor their own recall to reduce errors (Morcom, 2016). Wright and Stroud (2002) studied differences between younger and older adults identifying culprits after viewing crime videos. There was an own-age bias – both groups performed better when the culprit was of a similar age to themselves. Eyewitnesses may sometimes attend more closely to culprits of their own age. However, Neumann et al. (2015) found young adults did not attend more to young faces than older ones. Own-age bias might be due to expertise: most people have greater exposure to (and familiarity with) faces of individuals of their own age. Wiese et al. (2013) reported supporting evidence. Young geriatric nurses had no own-age bias because, due to their experience with older people, they recognised old faces much better than did young controls. Eyewitness identification: face recognition Eyewitness identification typically depends mainly on face recognition although other factors (e.g., an individual’s build and/or clothing) can be relevant. There is compelling evidence that most people find it surprisingly hard to recognise unfamiliar faces; this is of direct relevance to eyewit- nesses’ memory for culprits’ faces. Poor recognition of unfamiliar faces occurs in part because different photographs of the same person display considerable variability and are often regarded incorrectly as coming from different individuals (see Figure 3.18) (Jenkins et al., 2011; Young & Burton, 2018).

Valentine et al. (2003) found eyewitness identification is very fallible. Of 640 eyewitnesses trying to identify suspects in 314 real line- ups, only 40% identified the suspect, 20% identified a non-suspect and 40% failed to make an identification. Eyewitnesses who are very confident about face identification tend to be more accurate than those less confident (Brewer & Wells, 2011). For example, Odinot et al. (2009) studied the memory of 14 eyewitnesses of an actual supermarket robbery in the Netherlands. There was a moderate cor- relation (+.38) between eyewitness confidence and accuracy. Wixted et al. (2016; discussed earlier, see p. 364) also found that eyewitness confidence predicted accuracy of culprit identification in a real-life study. Eyewitnesses sometimes remember a face but fail to remember the precise circumstances in which they saw it. Ross et al. (1994) had eyewit- nesses observe an event where a bystander and the culprit were present. They were three times more likely to select the bystander from a line-up than someone else not seen before when the culprit was not present. This is unconscious transference – a face is correctly recognised as having been seen before but incorrectly judged to be responsible for a crime. In similar fashion, eyewitnesses are more likely to identify a suspect on a line-up if they have previously been seen in a line-up (Steblay & Dysart, 2016). Another relevant finding is the other-race effect – same-race faces are identified better than other-race faces (Young et al., 2012). Unsurprisingly, eyewitnesses having the most experience with members of another race have a relatively small other-race effect (Hugenberg et al., 2010). Contrary to common belief, the other-race effect does not depend entirely on problems with remembering other-race faces. Megreya et al. (2013) found perceptual processes are also involved (see Figure 8.12). British and Egyptian participants viewed a target face and an array of ten faces. They decided whether the target face was in the array; if so, they identified it. There were minimal memory demands on memory as all the photographs were visible. Megreya et al. obtained the other-race effect: (1) the target was correctly identified more often with same-race faces than other-race ones (70% vs 64%, respectively); and (2) when the target face was absent, mistaken identification of a non-target face was more frequent with other-race than same-race faces (47% vs 34%, respectively). Brown et al. (2017) replicated the other-race effect. There was greater activation of fronto-parietal networks (involved in top-down attention and cognitive control) during encoding of same-race than other-race faces. These findings suggest that problems with remembering other-race effects are due to reduced attention to (and processing of) such faces. In a study by Jenkins et al. (2011), observers showed very poor face recognition because photographs of the same face often show considera- ble variability (see Chapter 3). As a consequence, it is generally hard for eyewitnesses to make a correct identification from a single photograph as they are typically requested to do. It follows that eyewitnesses’ ability to identify unfamiliar faces might be enhanced if presented with multiple pho- tographs of the same person.

As predicted, face-recognition performance was worst following presentation of a single photograph and best following presentation of synthesised images. This is important because police can generate such synthesised images from a single photograph. From laboratory to courtroom Can we apply findings from laboratory studies to real-life crimes? There are several differences. First, eyewitnesses are much more likely to be the victims in real life than the laboratory. Second, it is much less stressful to watch a video of a violent crime than to experience it. Third, in laboratory research the consequences of an eyewitness making a mistake are trivial but can literally be a matter of life or death in an American trial. There are also important similarities. Ihlebaek et al. (2003) used a staged robbery involving two robbers with handguns. In the live condi- tion, eyewitnesses were ordered repeatedly to “Stay down!”. A video taken during the live condition was presented to eyewitnesses in the video con- dition. Eyewitnesses in both conditions exaggerated event duration and showed similar patterns in what they remembered. However, those in the video condition recalled more information. In another study (Pozzulo et al., 2008), eyewitnesses observed a staged theft live or via video. Eyewitnesses in the live condition reported more stress and arousal but correct identifi- cation of the culprit was comparable in the two conditions. Tollestrup et al. (1994) analysed police records concerning the identi- fications by eyewitnesses to crimes involving fraud and robbery. Factors important in laboratory studies (e.g., weapon focus; retention interval) were also important in real-life crimes. In sum, artificial laboratory conditions typically distort the findings only modestly. If anything, the errors in eyewitness memory under labora- tory conditions underestimate memory deficiencies for real-life events. This is due in part to the generally greater stressfulness of witnessing real-life crimes. Overall, laboratory research is definitely relevant to the legal system. ENHANCING EYEWITNESS MEMORY The police obviously have no control over the circumstances at the time of the crime (e.g., lighting; event duration). Such uncontrollable factors are known as estimator variables (Albright, 2017). There are also factors (known as system variables) that can be controlled by the criminal justice system; they include how line-ups are presented to eyewitnesses and inter- view techniques used to question eyewitnesses. These system variables are discussed below. Line-ups Line-ups can be divided into those involving double-blind and those involv- ing single-blind administration. With double-blind administration, the line-up is conducted by administrators who do not know which line-up member is the suspect, whereas they do have such knowledge with single- blind administration. Double-blind administration is preferable because Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["ecide whether the person shown at the top was present in the array underneath.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32."]}

Double-blind administration is preferable because Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.\n\nEveryday memory 373 single-blind administration can cause systematic bias in the identification made by the eyewitness (Kovera et al., 2017). Line-ups can be simultaneous (the eyewitness sees everyone at the same time) or sequential (the eyewitness sees only one person at a time). Which approach is more effective? Steblay et al. (2011) conducted a meta-analysis. When the culprit was present, they were selected 52% of the time with simul- taneous line-ups compared to 44% with sequential ones. When the culprit was absent, eyewitnesses mistakenly selected someone with simultaneous line-ups more often than with sequential ones (54% vs 32%, respectively). Thus, eyewitnesses adopt a more stringent criterion with sequential line-ups. Misidentifications with sequential line-ups in the laboratory can be reduced by providing a “not sure” option. This reduced misidentifications from 22% to only 12% (Steblay & Phillips, 2011). Warning eyewitnesses the culprit may not be in the line-up also reduces misidentification errors (Steblay, 1997). Wells et al. (2015) carried out a large-scale study differing from most studies reviewed by Steblay et al. (2011) in two main ways. First, it involved eyewitnesses to actual crimes rather than videoed or staged laboratory crimes. Second, the eyewitnesses were permitted to say they were “not sure” (as happens in most real-life crime cases). In contrast, the great majority of labo- ratory studies require eyewitnesses to make definite “yes” or “no” decisions. What did Wells et al. (2015) find? First, the suspect was identified 25% of the time with both simultaneous and sequential line-ups. Second, an innocent person was identified incorrectly more often with simultaneous than sequential line-ups (18% vs 11%). Third, eyewitnesses used the “not sure” response more often in the sequential line-up: eyewitnesses were unsure whether a subsequently viewed person might resemble the culprit more than the current one. Wixted et al. (2016) also studied eyewitnesses to real-life crimes and obtained confidence ratings from these eyewitnesses when exposed to sequential or simultaneous line-ups. Eyewitnesses identified 91% of sus- pects having independent evidence of guilt against them with simultane- ous line-ups compared to 76% with sequential line-ups. When account was taken of eyewitnesses’ confidence ratings, their overall performance was slightly better with simultaneous line-ups. In sum, eyewitnesses are more likely to identify the culprit with simul- taneous line-ups. However, innocent individuals are also more likely to be selected on simultaneous line-ups. Which type of line-up is preferable depends on the precise magnitude of these two effects. Cognitive interview Psychologists have contributed substantially to the goal of maximising the information provided by eyewitnesses being interviewed by developing the cognitive interview. This is based on four retrieval rules (Geiselman & Fisher, 1997): (1) mental reinstatement of the environment and any personal contact experience during the crime (context reinstatement); (2) encouraging the reporting of every detail including minor ones; Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32.","evidence":["ingle- blind administration.","Double-blind administration is preferable because Created from usyd on 2022-02-14 13:22:32."]}

These retrieval rules are based on our knowledge of human memory. The first two rules derive from the encoding specificity principle (Tulving, 1979; see Chapter 7). According to this principle, recall depends on the overlap or match between the context in which an event is witnessed and that at recall. The third and fourth rules are based on the assumption that memory traces contain several kinds of information. As a result, crime information can be retrieved using different retrieval routes. There have been two major changes in the cognitive interview (Memon et al., 2010a). First, researchers developed an enhanced cognitive interview. This differed from the basic cognitive interview by emphasising the impor- tance of creating rapport between interviewer and eyewitness. Roy (1991, p. 399) indicated how this can be achieved: Investigators should minimise distractions, induce the eyewitness to speak slowly, allow a pause between the response and next ques- tion, tailor language to suit the individual eyewitness, follow up with interpretive comment, try to reduce eyewitness anxiety and avoid judgemental and personal comments. Second, the police typically shorten the cognitive interview emphasising the first two retrieval rules discussed earlier. This is done in part because the entire cognitive interview can be very time-consuming. Findings Memon et al. (2010a) carried out a meta-analysis comparing the cogni- tive interview with the standard police interview. Many more details were correctly recalled by eyewitnesses with the cognitive interview (basic or enhanced). However, its beneficial effects were reduced in highly arous- ing situations or with a long retention interval between the incident and interview. Nevertheless, the cognitive interview remained effective even with high arousal and a long retention interval. The main limitation of the cognitive interview was that there was a fairly small increase in recall of correct details compared to the standard interview. In addition, the cogni- tive interview does not reduce the adverse effects of misleading information presented beforehand (Menon et al., 2009b). Are all four components of the cognitive interview equally important? No. Colomb and Ginet (2012) found mental or context reinstatement of the situation and reporting all the details both enhanced recall. However, altering the eyewitness’s perspective and changing the order of recall were ineffective. Dando et al. (2011) found requiring eyewitnesses to recall infor- mation in a backward temporal order reduced correct recall and increased memory errors. These negative effects occurred because backward recall disrupted the temporal organisation of eyewitness memory for the crime.

(2016) found eyewitnesses’ error rate was 6% when they seemed certain of what they were recalling but 23% when they seemed uncertain. Thus, accuracy can be improved by taking account of eyewit- nesses’ confidence. Paulo et al. (2017) adapted the cognitive interview to include category clustering recall – eyewitnesses organised their recall in categories (e.g., person details; location details; action details). This pro- duced enhanced recall compared to the standard cognitive interview and reduced errors. Category clustering recall was effective because it pro- vided eyewitnesses with cues providing an organised structure to facilitate retrieval of event information. Evaluation The cognitive interview has a well-established theoretical and empiri- cal basis. It is an effective method for obtaining as much accurate infor- mation as possible from eyewitnesses under most circumstances. There is increasing evidence concerning the relative effectiveness of the four main components of the cognitive interview. Potentially important refinements of the cognitive interview (e.g., category clustering recall; taking account of eyewitnesses’ confidence) have been proposed. What are the main limitations with the cognitive interview? First, the small increase in incorrect eyewitness recall can lead detectives to misinter- pret the evidence. Second, it does not reduce the negative effects of mis- information. Third, mental or context reinstatement can have a negative effect on recognition memory by increasing the perceived familiarity of non-target faces (Wong & Read, 2011). Fourth, the cognitive interview is less effective when the witnessed event was stressful and there is a long delay between the event and the interview. PROSPECTIVE MEMORY The great majority of memory studies have focused on retrospective memory, in which the emphasis is on the past (especially individuals’ ability to remember previous events or knowledge stored in long-term memory). In contrast, prospective memory is “the cognitive function we use for formulating plans and promises, for retaining them, and for recol- lecting them subsequently either at the right time or on the occurrence of appropriate cues” (Graf, 2012, pp. 7–8). Examples include remembering to go to meet a friend at a coffee shop or to attend a revision session for a course in psychology. Failures of prospective memory are responsible for at least 50% of everyday memory problems. Tragic events occurring as a result of failures of prospective memory also indicate its importance. Einstein and McDaniel (2005, p. 286) discussed an example: After a change in his usual routine, an adoring father forgot to turn toward the day-care centre and instead drove his usual route to work at the university. Several hours later, his infant son, who had been quietly asleep in the back seat, was dead.

Failures of the two types of memory are interpreted differently (Graf, 2012). Failures of prospective memory involving promises to another person are often regarded as indicating poor motivation and reliability. In contrast, failures of retrospective memory are attributed to poor memory. Thus, deficient prospective memory means a “flaky person” whereas deficient retrospective memory a means “faulty brain” (Graf, 2012). There are other differences: (1) Retrospective memory generally involves remembering what we know about something and can be high in informational content (Baddeley et al., 2015). In contrast, prospective memory typically focuses on when to do something and has low informational content. (2) Prospective memory is more relevant to our everyday plans and goals. (3) More external cues (e.g., “What did you have for breakfast yester- day?”) are typically available with retrospective than prospective memory. Anderson and McDaniel (2019) found in a naturalistic study that only 39% of individuals’ prospective-memory thoughts were trig- gered by external cues. (4) Prospective memory is the form of memory “in which the problem is not memory itself, but the uses to which memory is put” (Moscovitch, 2008, p. 309). Remembering and forgetting often involve both prospective and retrospec- tive memory. For example, achieving the task of buying goods from the local supermarket requires memory of the intention to go there (prospec- tive memory) and memory of what you had decided to buy (retrospective memory). Crawford et al. (2003) identified separate prospective and retrospective memory factors from a questionnaire designed to assess prospective and retrospective memory. There was also a general memory factor based on elements of prospective and retrospective memory. In sum, there are several similarities and differences between prospec- tive and retrospective memory. McBride and Workman (2017) provide a thorough review. Event-based vs time-based prospective memory There is an important distinction between time-based and event-based pro- spective memory. Time-based prospective memory involves performing a given action at a particular time (e.g., phone a friend at 8 pm). Event- based prospective memory involves performing an action in the appro- priate circumstances (e.g., passing on a message when you see a given person). Unsurprisingly, performance on event-based tasks depends in part on the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of any given individual’s time estimation (Waldum & McDaniel, 2016). There has been much more research on event-based prospective memory. With event-based tasks, researchers can manipulate the precise KEY TERMS Time-based prospective memory A form of prospective memory which involves remembering to carry out an intended action at the appropriate time.

That provides more control over retrieval conditions than is gen- erally possible with time-based tasks. In the real world, the requirement to use prospective memory typically occurs while individuals are busily involved in performing some unrelated task. Most laboratory research is similar because participants are generally engaged in an unrelated ongoing task while performing a prospective-memory task. Event-based tasks tend to be easier than time-based tasks. For example, Kim and Mayhorn (2008) found event-based prospective memory was supe- rior under both laboratory and naturalistic conditions because the intended actions are more likely to be triggered by external cues on event-based tasks. Hicks et al. (2005) confirmed event-based tasks are generally less demand- ing than time-based ones. However, both kinds of tasks were more demand- ing when the task was ill-specified (e.g., detect animal words) rather than well-specified (e.g., detect the words nice and hit). A well- specified time- based task was no more demanding than an ill-specified event-based task. The strategies used on time-based and event-based tasks often differ considerably. The occurrence of prospective-memory cues is typically more predictable on time-based tasks. As a result, individuals generally engage in only sporadic monitoring of prospective-memory cues on time-based tasks with this monitoring increasing as the occurrence of the cue approaches (Cona et al., 2015). In contrast, as we will see, there is much more evidence of continuous monitoring on event-based tasks because of unpredictability concerning the cue’s occurrence. Cona et al. (2015) showed the importance of predict- ability with event-based tasks: the pattern of monitoring resembled that typically found with time-based tasks when the occurrence of prospec- tive-memory cues was predictable. Stages in prospective memory Prospective memory typically involves several separate processes or stages. As a consequence, there are various ways prospective memory can fail. Zogg et al. (2012) provided a sketch map of the main processes/stages involved (see Figure 8.14): (1) Intention formation: the individual forms or encodes an intention linked to a specific cue (e.g., “I will discuss the weekend with my friend when I see him”). (2) Retention interval: there is a delay (minutes, hours or weeks) between intention formation and intention execution. As we have seen, there is typically frequent environmental monitoring for event cues on event- based tasks but sporadic monitoring for time cues on time-based tasks. (3) Cue detection and intention retrieval: the individual detects and recog- nises the relevant cue (e.g., sighting your friend; seeing it is 4 o’clock); this is followed by self-initiated retrieval of the appropriate intention. (4) Intention recall: the individual retrieves the intention from retrospec- tive memory; there may be problems because of the intention’s com- plexity, its relationship to other stored intentions or the presence of competing intentions.

IN THE REAL WORLD: PLANE CRASHES – PILOTS AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS Dismukes and Nowinski (2006) studied pilot errors involving memory failures. There were failures of prospective memory in 74 out of 75 incidents or accidents! There was an almost total absence of retrospective memory failures because pilots have excellent knowledge and memory of the operations needed to fly a plane. Here is an example of a plane crash caused by failure of prospective memory. On 31 August 1988, a Boeing 727 (Flight 1141) was in a long queue awaiting departure from Dallas-Fort Worth airport. The air traffic controller unexpectedly told the crew to move up past the other planes to the runway. This caused the crew to forget to set the wing flaps and leading edge slat to 15 degrees (a failure of prospective memory). As a result, the plane crashed beyond the end of the runway leading to several deaths. What causes pilots to exhibit prospective-memory failures? Relevant evidence was reported by Latorella (1998). Commercial pilots interrupted while flying a simulator made 53% more errors than those not interrupted. Such interruptions are relatively common. Gontar et al. (2017) discovered pilots on average experienced eight interruptions (e.g., from colleagues; from outside the cockpit) during preparations for each flight. Unsurprisingly, the adverse effects of interruption on task performance are greater with longer interruptions (Altmann et al., 2017).

More specifically, we can explain the effects of interruptions with Shelton and Scullin’s (2017) dynamic multiprocess framework (discussed later, pp. 382–386). According to this framework, we can remember to perform an intended action because of bottom-up processes (e.g., encountering a relevant cue). When pilots are not interrupted, each item in an action sequence cues the next action. Such cueing is lacking if actions are performed out of sequence. According to Shelton and Scullin (2017), we can also remember to perform an intended action because of top-down processes (i.e., monitoring for cues and rehearsing the intention). It is effortful using these processes when one is interrupted during task performance (Altmann et al., 2017). As a result, pilots can find it difficult to continue with a sequence of actions while monitoring and rehearsing. How can we reduce pilot errors following interruptions? Engaging in effortful top-down processes is one answer. Alternatively, retrieval cues such as the humble egg timer could be used to remind pilots to resume an interrupted task (Gontar et al., 2017). For example, pilots might only activate an egg timer when some task has been interrupted and will need to be attended to shortly. Errors made by air traffic controllers often involve prospective memory (failures to perform intended actions while monitoring a display). Loft and Remington (2010) found prospective- memory errors by participants in a simulated air traffic control task were more common when interruptions led them to deviate from well-practised or strong routines rather than less-practised ones. This is important because air traffic controllers (and pilots) devote much of their time to habitual tasks involving strong routines. Such tasks are carried out fairly “automatically” due to habit capture which can cause prospective-memory failures when something unexpected happens (Dismukes, 2012). Wilson et al. (2018) explored the effects of interruptions on a simulated air traffic control task. There were three conditions: (1) interruption involved a blank screen; (2) interruption involved a secondary air traffic control (ATC) task resembling the main one; and (3) a no-interruption control Figure 8.15 Mean failures to resume an interrupted task (left side) and mean resumption times in msec (right side) for the conditions: no-interruption, blank-screen interruption and secondary air traffic control task interruption.

Both interruption conditions increased the time taken to resume the main air traffic control task (see Figure 8.15) because participants took some time to re-activate information relevant to the main ATC task. In addition, there were more failures to resume the interrupted task following a secondary ATC task than in the other two conditions because the demands of the secondary task caused increased forgetting of the interrupted task. Loft et al. (2013, 2016) found prospective-memory errors were reduced when flashing visual aids accompanied the appearance of target planes. However, participants experiencing severe scheduling demands sometimes failed to take advantage of these visual aids. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and checking behaviour Most patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have checking compulsions. They check repeatedly they have locked their front door, the gas has been turned off and so on but remain uncertain whether they have actually performed their intended actions. How can we explain this checking behaviour? Perhaps obsessional individuals have poor retrospective memory ability causing them to forget whether they have recently engaged in checking behaviour. However, com- pulsive checkers are generally comparable to healthy controls in retrospec- tive memory (Cuttler & Graf, 2009a). Perhaps checkers have poor prospective memory. Cuttler and Graf (2009b) found checkers had impaired performance on event-based and time- based prospective-memory tasks. Similarly, Yang et al. (2015) found patients with OCD had impaired performance on time-based tasks and were slower than controls on event-based tasks. Yang et al. reported evidence the poor prospective memory of OCD patients involved impaired mental flexibility. It is possible poor prospective memory leads obsessionals to engage in excessive checking. However, excessive checking may lead to poor prospec- tive memory. Suppose you check several times every day you have locked your front door. You would remember you had checked it numerous times. However, you might well be unsure whether you have checked your front door today because of all the competing memories. Van den Hout and Kindt (2004) asked some participants to engage in repeated checking of a gas stove. On the final trial, those checking repeat- edly had less vivid and detailed memories of what had happened. Linkovski et al. (2013) carried out a similar study. They also assessed participants’ level of inhibitory control because obsessional patients have deficient inhib- itory control, which may lead to intrusive thoughts and memory problems. What did Linkovski et al. (2013) find? Repeated checking did not impair prospective-memory performance. However, it reduced memory vividness and detail and also lowered participants’ confidence in their memory. These effects were all much stronger in participants with poor inhibitory control (see Figure 8.16). Toffolo et al. (2016) emphasised the distinction between memory performance (i.e., memory accuracy) and meta-memory (knowledge and beliefs about one’s own memory). Meta-memory encompasses measures of memory confidence, memory vividness and memory detail. Toffolo et al. identified three main research findings: KEY TERMS Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) An anxiety disorder in which the symptoms include unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours (compulsions) in response to those thoughts.

(2) Repeated checking typically produces large reductions in meta- memory ratings which are comparable in OCD patients and controls (e.g., Radomsky et al., 2014). (3) Even though repeated checking reduces meta-memory ratings substan- tially, it typically has no effect on memory accuracy (e.g., Radomsky et al., 2014). In sum, patients with OCD often exhibit impaired prospective memory. The following conclusions seem warranted: Even though it is still unknown what comes first (the tendency to use more checking behaviour in general or OCD), . . . when people who are vulnerable for OCD use more checking, this may [reduce] memory confidence. This may subsequently lead to the vicious cycle of increased checking behaviour and memory distrust, eventually contributing to the development of new OC [obsessional compulsive] symptoms. (Toffolo et al., 2016, p. 60) Purdon (2018) discusses further evidence for the notion that checking behaviour impairs memory confidence. She also argues that patients with OCD have a need for certainty that contributes to their excessive checking behaviour. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON PROSPECTIVE MEMORY Our main emphasis here is on event-based prospective memory. What typ- ically happens is that two tasks are performed during the same period of time. One task is the ongoing task and the other is the prospective-memory task. As we will see, performance on the prospective-memory task depends on its relationship to the ongoing task.

According to this framework, various cognitive processes (including attentional ones) are used during prospective-memory tasks. However, the detection of cues for response is typically “automatic” (i.e., not requiring attentional processes) when the following criteria (especially the first) are fulfilled: (1) The ongoing task is a focal task – one that “encourages processing of the target [on the prospective-memory task] and especially those features that were processed at encoding [of the prospective- memory target]” (McDaniel et al., 2015, p. 2). Here is an example: the ongoing task requires participants to decide whether each letter string is a word and the prospective-memory task involves responding to the word “sleep”. (2) The cue on the prospective-memory task and the to-be-performed action are highly associated. (3) The cue is conspicuous or salient. (4) The intended action is simple. McDaniel et al. (2015) developed the multiprocess framework into the dual-pathways model (see Figure 8.17) based on the distinction between focal and non-focal ongoing tasks. A non-focal task “does not encourage processing of those features . . . processed at encoding [of the prospective-memory target]” (p. 2). For example, the ongoing task requires participants to decide whether each letter string is a word and the prospective- memory task involves responding to words starting with the letter r. Thus, there is much less overlap between the processing required on the prospective-memory and ongoing tasks when the latter is non-focal. It is assumed the processes typically used with focal and non-focal tasks differ substantially (see Figure 8.17). Strategic monitoring involves top-down attentional control processes to maintain the prospective- memory intention and to search for relevant cues on that task. It is used much more often with non-focal than with focal tasks. According to the dual-pathways model, retrieval on the prospective- memory task can occur in two ways: (1) spontaneous retrieval involves bottom-up processes triggered by the relevant stimulus and does not require prior monitoring; (2) intentional retrieval is based more on top-down pro- cesses and requires prior monitoring. Non-focal tasks involve intentional retrieval. In contrast, focal tasks generally involve spontaneous retrieval but can also involve intentional retrieval. Finally, the main brain areas asso- ciated with the cognitive processes involved in prospective memory are identified. Shelton and Scullin (2017) presented a dynamic multiprocess frame- work largely consistent with the dual-pathways model. Two cognitive pro- cesses underlie successful prospective-memory performance: (1) Monitoring: this involves top-down attentional control to search for cues indicating the prospective-memory action should be performed. (2) Spontaneous retrieval: this involves bottom-up processing triggered by processing a cue.

First, monitoring is effortful and often impairs ongoing task performance because it creates competition for processing capacity. As a consequence, monitoring is rarely used when the ongoing task is important (e.g., a committee meeting). Second, moni- toring is used primarily when prospective-memory cues are expected (e.g., when close to a wine shop as shown in Figure 8.18).

The solid black arrows indicate the sequence of processing over time. The dashed-line arrows indicate that strategic monitoring processes are sometimes involved even with focal tasks.

For example, monitoring depends importantly on meta-cognition (knowledge and beliefs about one’s own cognitive processes and performance). Suppose you perform a prospective-memory task. If you are confident the task will be easy (e.g., there will be strong retrieval cues), you might choose to rely on spontaneous retrieval rather than monitoring. However, if you expect the task to be difficult (e.g., retrieval cues will be weak or non-existent), you would probably choose to use extensive monitoring. In sum, the dynamic multiprocess framework differs from previous theories in that the processing strategies used on prospective-memory tasks are flexibly influenced by meta-cognitive processes. The multiprocess theory is less flexible – it assumes processing on prospective-memory tasks is predominantly determined by the task (focal vs non-focal). Findings The requirement to perform a prospective-memory task at the same time as an ongoing task generally leads to impaired performance on the ongoing task. According to the above theories, this occurs when the ongoing and prospective-memory tasks compete for processing resources. Such competi- tion is especially great when demanding top-down processes (e.g., monitor- ing) are used on the prospective-memory task. Support for the above theoretical assumptions was reported by Moyes et al. (2019). They found impaired performance on the ongoing task when it was non-focal and so demanding processing (especially monitoring) was required on the prospective-memory task. In contrast, performance was not impaired on the ongoing task when it was focal and so demanding monitoring processes on the prospective-memory task were not required. In spite of findings such as those of Moyes et al. (2019), the above the- oretical assumptions are oversimplified. Rummel et al. (2017) argued the requirement to perform two tasks at the same time reduces mind- wandering (task-unrelated thoughts) as participants try to cope with the overall pro- cessing demands. They obtained clear support for this argument. Rummel et al. (2017) also found performance on a prospective- memory task was much better (71% vs 42%) when financial incentives were provided for good performance. Strikingly, the extra processing resources invested in the prospective-memory task when incentives were provide d did not affect performance on the ongoing task because incentives reduced participants’ mind-wandering. Support for the general approach of the dual-pathways model was reported by McDaniel et al. (2013). They argued the monitoring required to perform a non-focal task would involve top-down attentional control. As a result, there would be sustained activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex, an area associated with attentional control. In contrast, the lesser demands of a focal task would produce only transient activity in that brain area. That is precisely what they found (see Figure 8.19). Cona et al. (2016) conducted a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies involving focal and non-focal tasks. As predicted by the dual-pathways model, patterns of brain activity differed between these two task types KEY TERMS Meta-cognition Beliefs and knowledge concerning one’s own cognitive processes and likely level of performance.

Overall, non-focal tasks were associated with more activity in parts of the anterior prefrontal cortex (BA10). In contrast, focal tasks were associated with more activity than focal ones in the anterior cerebellum, ventral parietal regions (BA40) and BA9. Cona et al. (2016, p. 1) concluded as follows: “Prospective remembering is medi- ated mainly by top-down and stimulus-independent processes in non-focal, but by more automatic, bottom-up, processes in focal tasks.” According to the dual-pathways model, automatic cue detection some- times occurs on prospective-memory tasks. Beck et al. (2014b) provided relevant evidence. Participants initially performed a block of trials with an ongoing task and a prospective-memory task. This was followed by a block of trials where they were instructed not to perform the prospective-memory task even though prospective-memory targets appeared. These instructions presumably prevented deliberate target monitoring. Nevertheless, targets in this second block were associated with activation in brain regions (e.g., the ventral parietal cortex) associated with spontaneous retrieval. Scullin et al. (2010) also obtained findings suggesting the existence of spontaneous retrieval of prospective-memory cues. They almost elimi- nated monitoring for prospective-memory cues by presenting only a single prospective-memory target after over 500 trials and by emphasising the importance of the ongoing task. This target was detected by 73% of par- ticipants when on a focal task but only 18% on a non-focal task. This is consistent with the model’s assumption that spontaneous retrieval occurs much more often with focal tasks. We turn now to the role of meta-cognition (emphasised within the dynamic multiprocess framework). Clear evidence of its importance was shown by Lourenço et al. (2015). Two tasks were performed at the same time: (1) an ongoing lexical decision task (see Glossary); (2) a prospective-memory Figure 8.19 (a) Sustained (PM Sus) and (b) transient (PM) activity in the left anterior prefrontal cortex (c) for non-focal (blue) and focal (red) prospective-memory (PM) tasks. The other conditions shown (i.e., CTL, Ong PM and Ong CTL) are not of theoretical relevance. From McDaniel (2013). Reprinted with permission of the Association for Psychological Science.

During practice, the target animal words were atypical (e.g., raccoon) or typical (e.g., dog). On the fol- lowing experimental trials, only atypical animal words were presented as prospective-memory targets. What did Lourenço et al. (2015) discover? We will focus on partic- ipants for whom the target words on the prospective-memory task were typical during practice but atypical on experimental trials. These partici- pants showed little or no monitoring during the initial experimental trials because they expected the prospective-memory task to be easy. However, they used monitoring much more when they realised that task was actually harder than they had expected. The take-home message is that strategy use is flexible: our use of monitoring increases (or decreases) as a result of experience and expectation. Suppose you perform an ongoing task of counting the number of living objects presented on a screen containing approximately 20 objects. At the same time, you must perform a prospective-memory task of detect- ing a given target (e.g., apple) presented in the upper right corner of the screen. On some trials, an object semantically related to the target (e.g., banana) is presented on the ongoing task. According to the dynamic mul- tiprocess framework, fixating the semantically related object should often cause spontaneous retrieval of the intention on the prospective-memory task. This in turn should lead to monitoring (revealed by rapid fixation on the upper right corner of the screen). Shelton and Christopher (2016) carried out the experiment described in the previous paragraph. Their findings were precisely as predicted by the dynamic multiprocess framework (see Figure 8.20). Thus, top-down moni- toring is often triggered by bottom-up spontaneous retrieval. In sum, performance on most prospective-memory tasks is determined by interactive bottom-up (e.g., spontaneous retrieval) and top-down (e.g., monitoring) processes. The various theories discussed are mostly consist- ent with each other. However, the dynamic multiprocess framework has advanced our understanding with its assumption that the strategies used on prospective-memory tasks are flexibly influenced by meta-cognitive processes.

Alternatively, we can place distinctive reminder cues where they will be seen at the appropriate time (Dismukes, 2012). For example, if you need to take a book into college tomorrow, you could leave it close to your keys. Motivation is also important. Cook et al. (2015) found prospective memory was better using monetary rewards for good performance or mon- etary punishments for poor performance (Cook et al., 2015). These benefits were achieved without impairing performance of the ongoing task. These findings may have occurred because of reduced mind-wandering (Rummel et al., 2017, discussed earlier, p. 384) in the high-motivation conditions. A relatively simple (but effective) technique for enhancing prospective memory is based on Gollwitzer’s notion of implementation intentions: “‘If situation Y is encountered, then I will perform the goal-directed response Z!’ Thus, implementation intentions define exactly when, where, and how one wants to act toward realizing one’s goals” (Gollwitzer, 2014, p. 306). Chen et al. (2015) found in a meta-analysis that implementation intentions enhanced prospective memory. Why are implementation intentions effective? Scullin et al. (2017) asked participants what they were thinking shortly after receiving imple- mentation-intention instructions. These instructions increased the tendency for participants to focus on specific aspects of the prospective-memory task and reduced mind-wandering. Gollwitzer argued that forming an implementation intention is like forming an “instant habit” that reduces the processing costs when inten- tions are retrieved on a prospective-memory task. Support was reported by Rummel et al. (2012). Participants receiving implementation intentions performed better on a prospective-memory task within an ongoing task. They also included trials where participants were told not to respond to target words from the prospective-memory task. These target words caused more disruption to the ongoing task (see Glossary) for participants previ- ously given implementation intentions. This happened because participants were more likely to retrieve their intentions relatively “automatically”. Overall evaluation There are several ways progress has been made in understanding prospec- tive memory: (1) The number and nature of the processes involved have been identified with increasing clarity. (2) Reasons for prospective-memory failures in various groups (e.g., pilots; obsessional individuals) have been identified. (3) There have been several theoretical advances. The dynamic multi- process framework (Shelton & Scullin, 2017) provides a coherent account of most findings with its emphasis on complex interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes.

(5) Researchers are developing a new field of “prospection” or future thinking including prospective memory. What are the limitations of theory and research on prospective memory? First, it is assumed within several theories (e.g., the dual-pathways model; see Figure 8.17) that monitoring will typically be used with non- focal ongoing tasks. However, this is not entirely correct. Anderson et al. (2018) instructed participants to engage in monitoring on every trial on the prospective-memory task or simply instructed them to perform that task. Both groups engaged in monitoring but the former group did so to a greater extent: they detected 73% of prospective-memory targets compared to only 59% for the latter group. Second, most theories de-emphasise individual differences in processing on prospective-memory tasks. For example, Scullin et al. (2018) gave par- ticipants the task of pressing the Q key whenever they saw a word belong- ing to the category of “fruits”. Thus, they should have encoded fruit as an abstract category. However, participants often encoded fruit as a specific example (e.g., apple), or they hardly thought at all about the instruction to focus on “fruits” (see Figure 8.21). Third, participants in most laboratory experiments lack strong incen- tives to exhibit good prospective-memory performance. In contrast, the incentives in real life can include saving lives (e.g., air traffic controllers). Fourth, moment-by-moment decisions to use top-down or bottom-up processes often involve meta-cognition (Shelton & Scullin, 2017). However, much remains to be discovered about meta-cognitive processes. Fifth, the processes involved in prospective memory are more complex than typically assumed. For example, the joint demands of performing a prospective-memory task and an ongoing task produce a reduction in mind-wandering (Rummel et al., 2017). Our limited understanding of the factors determining mind-wandering often makes it hard to predict prospective-memory performance.

CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. What people remember in traditional memory studies is largely determined by the experimenter’s demands for accuracy. In contrast, remembering in everyday life is determined by our personal goals. Tailoring our message to create an impression causes subsequent memory distortions. Memory research should strive for generalisability and representativeness. The distinction between traditional and everyday memory research is imprecise. • Autobiographical memory: introduction. Autobiographical memories generally have greater personal significance and complexity than episodic memories and can involve semantic memory. Autobiographical memory helps to maintain social bonds, a sense of self-continuity and self-enhancement. Individuals with highly superior autobiographical memory often have obsessional symptoms and devote much time to thinking about past events. Flashbulb memories are perceived as more vivid than other memories even though they are often inaccurate and have only moderate consistency. Flashbulb memories generally resemble other memories in their susceptibility to interference and forgetting. • Memories across the lifetime. There is infantile amnesia for memories of the first two years of life. It occurs because the cognitive self only emerges towards the end of the second year of life and because of hippocampal neurogenesis (generation of new neurons within the hippocampus). Relative amnesia for the preschool years ends when children have a good command of language. The reminiscence bump for important personal memories is much stronger for positive memories than negative ones because the retrieval of autobiographical memories is often guided by the life script. • Theoretical approaches to autobiographical memory. According to the self-memory system model, autobiographical information is stored hierarchically. An individual’s goals and personality influence the retrieval of autobiographical memories. Autobiographical memories can be accessed via direct or generative retrieval. The prefrontal cortex (associated with controlled processing) and the amygdala (involved in emotional processing) are activated during autobiographical retrieval. Several interconnected brain networks are involved in autobiographical retrieval, with the brain areas activated shifting between initial searching for memories and their subsequent elaboration.

Therapy to increase the specificity of depressed patients’ autobiographical memories has proved successful in reducing depressive symptoms. • Eyewitness testimony. Eyewitnesses’ initial confidence in their initial identification provides valid evidence concerning its accuracy. Eyewitness memory is influenced by several factors including confirmation bias, stress and ageing. Misinformation typically produces distorted eyewitness memory but often does not cause permanent alteration of memory traces. Misinformation can enhance eyewitness memory if it acts as a cue facilitating retrieval of an event. Eyewitness memory for faces is affected by the cross- race effect, and also by difficulties in recognising a given unfamiliar face from different photographs of that person. • Enhancing eyewitness memory. Culprits are more likely to be identified from simultaneous than from sequential line-ups, but more innocent individuals are identified with simultaneous line-ups. Which type of line-up is preferable depends on the magnitude of these two effects. The cognitive interview leads eyewitnesses to produce many more detailed memories with a small increase in inaccurate memories. Inaccurate memories can be detected because eyewitnesses often have low confidence in the accuracy of such memories. Mental reinstatement and the requirement to report all details are both crucial to the success of the cognitive interview. • Prospective memory. Prospective memory involves successive stages of intention formation, monitoring, cue detection, intention retrieval and intention execution. Event-based prospective memory is often better than time-based prospective memory because the intended actions are more likely to be triggered by external cues. Many failures of prospective memory (e.g., by pilots) occur when individuals are interrupted while carrying out an action plan and lack time to form a new plan. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder engage in excessive checking behaviour which may reduce their confidence in their prospective-memory ability. • Theoretical perspectives on prospective memory. According to the dynamic multiprocess framework, prospective memory involves interactions between top-down processes (e.g., monitoring) and bottom-up ones (e.g., spontaneous retrieval). The extent to which effortful monitoring is used depends on meta-cognitive processes assessing how well the prospective-memory task would be performed in its absence. Neuroimaging evidence supports the distinction between top-down and bottom-up processes. Implementation intentions enhance prospective-memory performance by facilitating the relatively “automatic” retrieval of intentions.

Our social inter- actions depend very heavily on language and all students need a good command of language. The main reason we know much more than previous generations is because knowledge is passed on from one generation to the next via language. What is language? According to Harley (2013, p. 5), language: “is a system of symbols and rules that enable us to communicate. Symbols stand for other things: Words (written or spoken) are symbols. The rules specify how words are ordered to form sentences.” Communication is the primary function of language. However, Crystal (1997) identified eight different functions. In addition to communication, we use language for thinking, to record information, to express emotion (e.g., “I love you”), to pretend to be animals (e.g., “Woof! Woof!”), to express identity with a group (e.g., singing in church), and so on. It is somewhat surprising there was little research on language prior to the late 1950s. The behaviourists (e.g., Skinner, 1957) argued that the language we produce consists of rewarded conditioned responses. According to this analysis, there is nothing special about language and no reason other species should not be able to develop language. The situation was transformed by Noam Chomsky (1957, 1959). He claimed (correctly!) that the behaviourist approach to language was woefully inade- quate. According to him, language possesses several unique features (e.g., grammar or syntax) and can only be acquired by humans. Chomsky’s ideas led to a dramatic increase in language research (Harley & McAndrew, 2015). As a result, language has been of central importance within cognitive psy- chology ever since. Is language unique to humans? Bonobos (a species of great ape) have developed better language skills than any other non-human species. Panbanisha (1985–2012) was trained on a special keypad with about 400 geometric patterns or lexigrams on it.

PART III VISUAL PERCEPTION AND ATTENTION Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\n394 Language He acquired a vocabulary of 3,000 words by the age of 14 years and often combined symbols in their correct order (e.g., “Please can I have an iced coffee?”). It has often been argued that apes’ use of language lacks spontaneity and refers almost exclusively to the present. This matters because these are two criteria for language. However, 74% of the utterances of Panbanisha and two other great apes were spontaneous (Lyn et al., 2011). In addition, the apes referred to the past as often as young children and produced more responses referring to future intentions. Lyn et al. (2014) found bonobos (including Panbanisha and her half-brother Kanzi) could communicate about displaced objects (i.e., those no longer present). Genty et al. (2015) found bonobos were more likely to repeat a message with a familiar recipient but to elaborate the original message with an un- familiar recipient. This ability to vary communications to accommodate the recipient’s needs is characteristic of children’s use of language. Clay and Genty (2017) reviewed the research on bonobos, concluding that their behaviour exhibits “considerable communicative complexity, flexibility, and intentionality”. What are the main limitations of bonobos’ language acquisition? First, bonobos’ utterances are much less likely than those of young children (aged 12–24 months) to reflect motivation to engage in social inter- action. Children’s statements often refer to intentions, attention seeking or offering something to someone else, whereas 80% of bonobos’ utter- ances are requests (e.g., for food) (Lyn et al., 2014). Such evidence led Scott-Phillips (2015) to argue that apes lack our ability to engage in “mind reading”, which allows us to infer how our utterances are likely to be interpreted. This is at least partly correct but probably overstated (Moore, 2015). Second, children’s language skills develop dramatically after the age of 2 years and so become markedly superior to those of bonobos. For example, children’s language exhibits much more productivity (expressing numerous ideas) and is much more complex (e.g., sentence length; use of grammati- cal structures). Third, as Chomsky (quoted in Atkinson et al., 1993) pointed out, “If an animal had a capacity as biologically advantageous as language but somehow hadn’t used it until now, it would be an evolutionary miracle, like finding an island of humans who could be taught to fly.” Fourth, an increasingly common view (e.g., Christiansen & Chater, 2008, 2016; discussed below) is that several non-language cognitive processes (e.g., short-term memory; thinking; learning) play a vital role in the develop- ment of language. Bonobos can acquire only some aspects of language, in part because their non-language cognitive processes are considerably infe- rior to ours.

Chomsky claimed humans possess an innate universal grammar (a set of grammatical principles found in all human languages). In Chomsky’s own words, “Whatever universal grammar is, it’s just the name for [our] genetic structure” (Baptista, 2012, pp. 362–363). According to Chomsky, there are several linguistic universals (features common to nearly every language) that jointly form a universal grammar. One possible linguistic universal (feature common to nearly every language) is recursion (embedding clauses within sentences to generate increasingly long sentences). For example, we can use recursion to expand the sentence “John met Mary in Brighton” to “John, who was a handsome man, met Mary in Brighton”. Other possible linguistic universals are lexical catego- ries (e.g., nouns; verbs; adjectives) and word order (subject-verb-object or subject-object-verb). Chomsky proposed an innate universal grammar for various reasons. First, he argued, it explains why only humans fully develop language. Second, it explains the alleged broad similarities among the world’s languages. Third, he claimed that young children develop language much faster than would be predicted on the basis of their exposure to spoken language. However, experience obviously determines which language any given child learns. Christiansen and Chater (2008) totally disagreed with Chomsky. Their main points were as follows: (1) Languages differ enormously, which is inconsistent with the notions of universal grammar and linguistic universals. (2) The notion that natural selection has provided us with genes respon- sive to abstract features of languages we have never encountered is mystifying. (3) Languages change amazingly rapidly. For example, all Indo-European languages emerged from a common source in under 10,000 years (Baronchelli et al., 2012). Natural selection could not have kept pace. (4) “Language has been shaped by the brain: language reflects pre- existing, and hence non-language-specific, human learning and pro- cessing mechanisms” (Christiansen & Chater, 2008, p. 491). In other words, our language ability is less special and less different from our other cognitive abilities than implied by Chomsky. (5) Children find it easy to acquire language because it was invented by humans to take account of human abilities: “language has adapted to our brains” (Christiansen & Chater, 2008, p. 490). In what follows, we discuss relevant research. As we will see, this research has revealed many limitations in Chomsky’s theoretical approach.

The main European languages are very similar, but large differences appear when all the world’s 6,000 to 8,000 languages are considered. Evans and Levinson (2009, p. 429) did precisely that and concluded, “There are vanishingly few universals of lan- guage in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them”. For example, there is limited evidence that recursion (discussed above, p. 395) is lacking in the Amazonian language Pirahã. However, Futrell et al.’s (2016) thorough attempt failed to find any strong evidence for it. Evidence concerning other suggested language universals is hotly con- tested. Evans and Levinson (2009) concluded some languages (e.g., the Austronesian language Charrosso) lack one or more of the lexical cate- gories of noun, verbs and adjectives. However Chung (2012) analysed Charrosso in considerable detail and concluded that in fact it has nouns, verbs and adjectives! She concluded the failure to identify the three main lexical categories in some languages occurs because they are insufficiently studied. Word order has claims to be a linguistic universal. Greenberg (1963) found the subject preceded the object in 98% of numerous languages. The word order subject-verb-object (S-V-O) was most common followed by subject-object-verb (S-O-V). Sandler et al. (2005) studied the Al-Sayyid group living in an isolated Israeli community. High levels of congenital deaf- ness in this community led them to develop Bedouin Sign Language, which uses the S-O-V word order even though it differs from other languages to which they are exposed. The above findings can be interpreted in more than one way. It can be argued the central importance of the subject in a sentence means it makes sense for the subject to precede the object regardless of any genetic considerations; and that ordering facilitates communication. Fedzechkina et al. (2018) argued that word-order preferences in any lan- guage reflect the limitations of human information processing. More spe- cifically, they predicted that words strongly associated grammatically (and in meaning) should appear close together within sentences to minimise processing costs. This is, indeed, the case across languages that otherwise appear superficially different. Bickerton (1984) proposed the language bioprogram hypothesis, which is closely related to Chomsky’s views. According to this hypothesis, chil- dren will create a grammar even if hardly exposed to a proper language. Senghas et al. (2004) studied deaf Nicaraguan children at special schools. These children developed a new system of gestures that expanded into a basic sign language (Nicaraguan Sign Language) passed on to successive groups of children. Since this sign language does not resemble Spanish or the gestures of hearing children, it is a genuinely new language. Nicaraguan Sign Language is still developing – Kocab et al.

The above findings suggest humans have a strong innate motivation to acquire language (including grammatical rules) and to communicate with others. However, they provide only modest support for a universal grammar. According to Chomsky, only humans have the genetic make-up permitting language acquisition. Relevant evidence comes from research on the KE family in London. Across three generations, about 50% of family members have suffered from severe language problems (e.g., difficulties in under- standing speech; slow and ungrammatical speech). Their complex lan- guage disorder was controlled by a specific gene FOCP2 (Lai et al., 2001). More specifically, mutations of this gene were found only in affected family members. Why does FOXP2 cause these language impairments? It is probably a hub in various gene networks leading to impaired functioning of brain areas directly involved in language. However, we must not exaggerate the impor- tance of FOXP2 for various reasons: (1) The FOXP2 sequence is found in numerous vertebrate species not possessing language. (2) Other genes such as ATP2C2 and CMIP are also associated with spe- cific language impairment (Graham & Fisher, 2013). (3) Mueller et al. (2016) found common genetic variants in FOXP2 had negligible effects on language ability within a normal sample. Findings: child-directed speech Chomsky claimed children’s rapid acquisition of language cannot be explained solely on the basis of their exposure to language. However, he minimised the richness of the linguistic input to which children are exposed. Parents and other adults use child-directed speech involving very short, simple sentences, a slow rate of speaking and use of a restricted vocabulary. Unsurprisingly, children whose parents use a lot of child-directed speech show faster language development than other children (Rowe, 2008). Thus, most parents are “in tune” with children’s current language abilities and so provide strong environmental support. Chomsky exaggerated the speed with which young children master lan- guage. Children’s speech during their first two years of speaking is remarkably limited (Bannard et al., 2009) – they use a small set of famil- iar verbs and often repeat back what they have just heard. Bannard et al. (2013) found 3-year-olds often engage in “blind copying” – they imitate everything an adult has just said even when part of it does not add any useful information.

Much evidence indicates that language is less special (in the sense of being different from other cognitive functions) than assumed by Chomsky. Campbell and Tyler (2018) reviewed neuroimaging research indicating that many brain regions are included within the “language network”. Most of these areas are associated with general cognitive functions (e.g., attention; memory). However, some brain areas (e.g., BA45; posterior middle tempo- ral gyrus) form a “syntax system” involved in syntactic processing, which is damaged in patients with impaired syntactic processing. This syntax system could be regarded as “special”. Other research has indicated that language comprehension and production both depend on general cognitive processes such as attention and cogni- tive control (see McClain & Goldrick, 2018, for a review). There is also much evidence for a “language-as-skill” framework, according to which language acquisition is a type of skill acquisition resembling learning to play a musical instrument (Chater & Christiansen, 2018). Within this framework “Language is connected to basic psychological mechanisms of learning and process- ing” (p. 207). In other words, language skills are not “special”. Evaluation Chomsky’s theoretical approach receives some support from evidence suggesting only humans possess fully developed language. His general approach also receives limited support from the identification of specific genes that sometimes influence language acquisition. What are the limitations of Chomsky’s approach? First, the world’s lan- guages differ far more than he predicted. Second, Chomsky now admits the universal grammar is very restricted in scope and so there are very few linguistic universals. Third, the notion that children’s linguistic input is too impoverished to produce language acquisition is highly debatable. Fourth, Chomsky de-emphasised the importance of our high-level cognitive abil- ities in explaining why only humans have fully developed language skills. Whorfian hypothesis The best-known theory about the relationship between language and thought was proposed by Benjamin Lee Whorf (1956). He was a fire pre- vention officer for an insurance company, and his hobby was linguistics. Whorf’s views have often been distorted to imply that he believed that lan- guage necessarily determines thought (and behaviour). Whorf’s actual views were far more reasonable. For example, he discussed a hypothetical case in which an explosion occurred when workers were careless with cigarettes near empty gasoline drums. The workers’ care- lessness may have been due in part to the word empty, which suggests there is nothing in the drum (not even vaporous fumes). This example could be interpreted as meaning that Whorf believed that language determines Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["tences used by parents and others when talking to young children.","Language 397 Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

However, he clarified his views (quoted in Lee, 1996, p. 153): “I don’t wish to imply that language is the sole or even the leading factor in . . . the ﬁre-causing carelessness through misunderstand- ings induced by language, but that this is simply a coordinate factor along with others.” According to the Whorfian hypothesis, language influences thinking and behaviour in various ways. Of central importance is the notion of linguistic relativity – how speakers of any given language think are influenced by the language they speak. Findings Categorical perception means observers find it easier to discriminate between stimuli belonging to different categories than those in the same category (see Chapter 9). Categorical perception is assumed to depend in part on language. Suppose we compared the categorical perception of colour in people speaking different languages that varied in the number of basic colour terms. According to the Whorfian hypothesis, we might predict these linguistic differences would influence the perception (and memory for) colour. Support for this prediction was reported by Winawer et al. (2007). Russian differs from English in having separate words for dark blue (siniy) and light blue (goluboy). Russian participants found it easier than English ones to discriminate between dark and light blue stimuli. Other studies have produced different findings. For example, Wright et al. (2015) compared colour memory in English speakers (11 basic colour terms) and Himba speakers (5 basic colour terms) but found no differences. Wright et al. also reviewed other research in which the findings were a mixture of significant and non-significant with no obvious explanation for the differences. Manner of motion (e.g., hopping; running) is expressed more prominently in English than Spanish. As a result, Kersten et al. (2010) argued English speakers should outperform Spanish ones on a task where novel animated objects were categorised on the basis of manner of motion. The find- ings were as predicted, suggesting language can influence thinking and performance. We must not exaggerate language’s impact on thinking. Consider a study by Li et al. (2009). Observers saw objects made of a given substance (e.g., a plastic whisk). English speakers focused on the object itself (whisk) rather than the substance (plastic), whereas Mandarin and Japanese speakers focused on the substance. The above differences may reflect differences in the three languages and so support the Whorfian hypothesis. However, when participants simply indi- cated how likely they would be to think of various objects as objects or as substances, there were no differences across the three languages. Thus, the effects of language were very task specific. KEY TERMS Whorfian hypothesis The theoretical assumption that language influences perception, thinking and behaviour.

They have no words to express precise quantities or numbers, not even “one”. Nevertheless, the Pirahã could perform exact quantitative matches even with large numbers of objects. However, their performance was inaccu- rate when information needed to be remembered. Thus, language is not essential for certain numerical tasks. However, it provides an efficient way of encoding information and so boosts performance when memory is required. Evaluation Language influences our thinking and performance on many tasks (Wolff & Holmes, 2011). For example, it can enhance memory (Frank et al., 2008) and increase categorical perception (Winawer et al., 2007). This is unsur- prising: “Language mobilises ordinary cognitive mechanisms whose effects on people’s thoughts, feelings, and judgments should be uncontroversial” (Casasanto, 2016, p. 715). The crucial issue is not whether the Whorfian hypothesis is correct but rather it is to identify the conditions in which language does (and does not) influence cognition. Regier and Xu (2017) addressed the latter issue by focusing on mental uncertainty. High mental uncertainty “opens the door to language to fill in some of the missing elements, and there should be a relatively strong effect of language” (p. 1). For example, Bae et al. (2015) asked American participants to identify the colour they had seen immedi- ately or after a delay. There was greater bias reflecting colour categories in the English language in the latter condition where there was greater uncer- tainty concerning the colour presented. Language chapters We possess four main language skills (listening to speech; reading; speak- ing; and writing). It is perhaps natural to assume any given person will have generally strong or weak language skills. That assumption is often incorrect with respect to people’s first language – for example, many people speak fluently and coherently but find writing difficult. The assumption is even less exact with respect to people’s second language. The first author has spent numerous summer holidays in France and can just about read newspapers and easy novels in French. However, he finds it agonisingly hard to under- stand rapidly spoken French and his ability to speak French is poor. The three chapters in this section (Chapters 9–11) in this section focus on the four main language skills. Chapter 9 deals with the basic processes involved in reading and listening to speech. The emphasis is on how readers and listeners identify and make sense of individual words. As we will see, the study of brain-damaged patients has clarified the complex processes under- lying reading and speech perception. Chapter 10 deals mostly with the processes involved in the comprehen- sion of sentences and discourse (connected text or speech). Most of these processes are common to text and speech.

Understanding discourse involves drawing numerous inferences and often forming a mental model of the situation described. Chapter 11 deals with the remaining two main language abilities: speaking and writing. We spend much more of our time speaking than writing. This helps to explain why we know much more about speech production than writing. Research on writing has been somewhat neglected until recently. This is regrettable given the importance of writing skills in many cultures. The processes discussed in these three chapters are interdependent. For example, listeners use language production processes to predict what speakers will say next (Pickering & Garrod, 2013). More generally, Chater et al. (2016, p. 244) argued that “Language comprehension and production are facets of a unitary skill”.

Language is so important that this chapter and the following two are devoted to it. In this chapter, we consider basic processes involved in recognising spoken words and reading words. As discussed in Chapter 10, many comprehension processes are very similar whether we listen to someone talking or read a text. For example, you would probably understand the sentence, “You have done exception- ally well in your cognitive psychology examination”, equally well whether you read or heard it. Rayner and Clifton (2009) identified two important similarities between speech perception and reading. First, both are typically fast. Adult readers can read between 250 and 350 words per minute. Speech perception is slower but can approach typical reading rates. Second, reading and speech perception are incremental – much processing (e.g., semantic; syntactic) occurs while a word is attended to. Another similarity concerns anticipatory language processing. Readers and listeners devote resources during sentence processing to predicting upcoming words or phrases (Huettig, 2015). The complexities involved are discussed fully later (see pp. 415–416). There is a final important similarity. Children learn to understand speech before they learn to read. Unsurprisingly, some processes and abil- ities involved in understanding speech are also relevant in reading. For example, individuals with severe reading problems frequently have prob- lems with auditory processing (Farmer & Klein, 1995). More specifically, such individuals are often impaired at categorising phonemes (speech sounds) (O’Brien et al., 2018). There are also several differences between reading and speech percep- tion. In reading, most words can be seen as a whole and remain in vision. In contrast, spoken words are spread out in time and are transitory. In addition, it is harder to decide where one word ends and the next starts. Speech generally provides a more ambiguous signal than printed text. For example, when words were spliced out of spoken sentences Chapter 9 Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["age 401 Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","http://taylorandfrancis.com Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

Our ability to hear what a speaker is saying is often impaired by other speakers close by and/or irrelevant noises. In contrast, readers are rarely distracted by other visual stimuli. Finally, demands are greater when listen- ing to speech than reading a text because previous words are inaccessible. So far we have indicated why speech perception can be harder than reading. However, speech perception can be easier in some ways. Speech often contains prosodic cues (see Glossary and Chapter 10), which are hints to sentence structure and intended meaning provided by the speaker’s pitch, intonation, stress and timing. Speakers also often accompany their speech with meaningful gestures. In contrast, the main cues to sentence structure in text are punctuation marks (e.g., commas; semi-colons). These cues are often less informative than speakers’ prosodic cues. Some adult brain-damaged patients can understand spoken language but cannot read. Other patients have good reading skills but cannot under- stand the spoken word. Thus, reading and speech perception involve some- what different brain areas and cognitive processes. This chapter starts with the basic processes specific to speech percep- tion (e.g., those required to divide the speech signal into separate words and to recognise those words). After that, we consider the basic processes specific to reading (e.g., those involved in recognising, reading individual words and guiding our eye movements). Why have we adopted this order- ing (speech perception followed by reading)? As mentioned earlier, most children develop competence in speech perception several years before they can read. In addition, some processes that children use while learning to read closely resemble those acquired earlier when learning to understand spoken language. In Chapter 10, we discuss comprehension processes common to reading and listening. The emphasis there is on larger units of language consisting of several sentences. SPEECH (AND MUSIC) PERCEPTION Speech perception is easily the most important form of auditory perception. However, “The human relationship with sound is much deeper and more ancient than our relationship with words” (Kraus & Slater, 2016, p. 84). Important forms of auditory perception not involving words include music perception and identifying the nature and sources of environmental sounds. The relationship between speech perception and auditory perception is controversial. Perhaps humans have special speech-perception mecha- nisms: the “speech is special” approach (e.g. Trout, 2001). Alternatively, the same general mechanisms may process speech and non-speech sounds (Carbonell & Lotto, 2014). Brandt et al. (2012, p. 1) claimed controversially that we can “describe language as a special type of music”. There is some support for this claim. First, music and language perception both involve the goal of “grouping acoustic features together to form meaningful objects and streams” (Kraus & Slater, 2016, p. 86).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nSpeech perception and reading 405 Second, if you listen repeatedly to the same looped recording of speech, it often starts to sound like singing when you stop attending to its meaning (Tierney et al., 2013). Brain areas associated with music perception were more activated by repeated speech perceived as song than repeated speech not perceived as song. Tierney et al. (2018) also studied the speech-to-song illusion. Ratings of the musicality of spoken phrases increased when these phrases were repeated and listeners became more responsive to the musical structure (e.g., melodic structure) of the phrases. Further evidence on the relationship between speech and music percep- tion is discussed briefly below. Categorical perception Suppose listeners are presented with a series of sounds, starting with /ba/ and gradually moving towards /da/, and report what sound they hear. What typically happens is categorical perception – speech stimuli intermediate between two phonemes are categorised as one of those phonemes (discussed later in a section entitled “Ganong effect”, p. 415). Below we consider whether categorical perception is unique to speech perception. Raizada and Poldrack (2007) presented listeners with two audi- tory stimuli and asked them to decide whether they represented the same phoneme. There was evidence of categorical perception. The differences in brain activation associated with the two stimuli were amplified when they were on opposite sides of the boundary between the two phonemes. There is often only limited evidence for categorical perception with speech sounds. It is less evident with vowels than consonants, and listeners are often sensitive to variations within a given perceptual category (Monahan, 2018). Bidelman and Walker (2017) reviewed findings indicating categorical perception is also present in music. However, it was stronger for speech than music (especially among non-musician listeners). These findings suggest categorical perception occurs mostly with familiar stimuli. Finally, Weidema et al. (2016) presented various pitch contours embedded in linguistic or melodic phrases. There was evidence of categor- ical perception in both the language and music contexts. However, identi- cal pitch contours were categorised differently depending on whether they were perceived as language or music. Thus, there are both similarities and differences in categorical perception in speech and music. Do music and speech perception involve the same brain areas? The relationship between music and speech perception can be studied by comparing the brain areas activated with each form of perception. However, “The extent of neural overlap between music and speech remains hotly debated” (Jantzen et al., 2016, p. 1). Some neuroimaging research has reported mostly non-overlapping brain regions are involved in music and speech perception. However, Slevc and Okada (2015) argued this is not the case when relatively complex tasks are used. They found complex music and speech perception both involved cognitive control (using the prefrontal cortex areas), which is used “to KEY TERM Categorical perception A sound intermediate between two phonemes is perceived as being one or other of the phonemes; a similar phenomenon is found in vision with colour perception.

Lacroix et al. (2015) conducted a meta-analytic review. Passive music and speech listening were both associated with activation in large areas of the superior temporal gyrus. However, the precise areas differed between music and speech perception (see Figure 9.1). In addition, Broca’s area (in the inferior frontal gyrus) was more activated during speech perception than music perception. Lacroix et al. concluded: “Our findings of spatially distinct regions for music and speech clearly suggest the recruitment of distinct brain networks for speech and music” (p. 15). Research on brain-damaged patients has also revealed important dif- ferences between speech and music perception. Some patients have intact speech perception but impaired music perception whereas others have intact music perception but impaired speech perception (Peretz & Coltheart, 2003). In sum, there are important similarities between music and speech per- ception (e.g., the involvement of cognitive control). However, they differ with respect to underlying brain areas and cognitive processes. Note that the specific tasks used to assess music or speech perception greatly influence the precise brain areas activated (Lacroix et al., 2015). Processing stages A sketch map of the main processes involved in speech perception is shown in Figure 9.2. Initially, listeners often have to select out the speech signal of interest from several other irrelevant auditory inputs (e.g., other voices; see Chapter 5). After that, decoding involves extracting discrete elements (e.g., phonemes or other basic speech sounds) from the speech signal. There is controversy as to whether decoding involves identifying phonemes (small units of sound; see Glossary) or syllables (speech units based on a vowel sound often plus one or more consonants).

Listeners heard lists of non-words recorded by speakers who had been told phonemes or syllables were the basic units of perception. Listeners detected phoneme targets faster than syllable targets when the speaker believed phonemes were the basic units, but the opposite was the case when the speaker believed syllables were the basic units. These findings suggest either phonemes or syllables can form the perceptual units in speech perception. There is an important distinction between phonemes and allophones (variant forms of any given phoneme). Consider the words pit and spit. They both contain the same phoneme /p/. However, there are slight differ- ences in the way /p/ is pronounced in the two words. Thus, there are two allophones relating to /p/ but only one phoneme and so allophones are context-dependent whereas phonemes are context-independent. There has been controversy as to whether phonemes or allophones are the basic units in spoken word recognition. However, Mitterer et al. (2018) reviewed the literature and reported several experiments suggesting that early processing of spoken words is based on allophones rather than phonemes. The third stage (word identification) is of special importance. Various problems in word identification are discussed shortly. However, one Figure 9.2 The main processes involved in speech perception and comprehension. From Cutler and Clifton (1999). By permission of Oxford University Press.

As a result, most spoken words resemble many other words at the phonemic level, making them hard to distinguish. However, the task becomes easier if listeners make use of allophones rather than phonemes (discussed above). The fourth and fifth stages both emphasise speech comprehension. The fourth stage focuses on utterance interpretation. This involves constructing a coherent meaning for each sentence based on information about indi- vidual words and their order within the sentence. Finally, the fifth stage involves integrating the meaning of the current sentence with preceding speech to construct an overall model of the speaker’s message. In sum, speech perception and comprehension involve several pro- cessing stages. However, it is an oversimplification to assume speech per- ception typically involves serial processes occurring in the neat-and-tidy fashion shown in Figure 9.2. LISTENING TO SPEECH Understanding speech is often difficult for two broad types of reasons. First, speech perception depends on several aspects of the speech signal (discussed shortly, pp. 409–412). Second, it depends on whether speech is heard under optimal or adverse conditions. Mattys et al. (2012, p. 953) defined an adverse condition as “any factor leading to a decrease in speech intelligibility on a given task relative to the level of intelligibility when the same task is performed in optimal listening conditions”. Mattys et al. (2009) identified two major types of adverse conditions. First, there is energetic masking: distracting sounds cause the intelligibility of target words to be degraded. Energetic masking, which mostly affects bottom-up processing, is a serious problem in everyday life (e.g., several people talking at once; noise of traffic). Until recently, most laboratory research on speech perception lacked ecological validity (see Glossary) because listeners were rarely confronted by distracting sounds. Second, there is informational masking: cognitive load (e.g., per- forming a second task while listening to speech) makes speech percep- tion harder. Informational masking mainly affects top-down processing. For example, Mitterer and Mattys (2017) found speech perception was impaired by cognitive load even when the second task was visual in nature (face processing). Alain et al. (2018) found listeners use different processes depending on why speech perception is difficult. They conducted a meta-analysis (see Glossary) of three types of studies: (1) speech in noise; (2) degraded speech; and (3) complexity of the linguistic input. Their key finding was that pat- terns of brain activation varied across these three types of studies. Problems with the speech signal Here are some specific problems with the speech signal often faced by listeners: (1) There is segmentation, which involves separating out or distin- guishing phonemes (units of sound) and words from the pattern of KEY TERM Segmentation Dividing the almost continuous sounds of speech into separate phonemes and words.

Most speech has few periods of silence, as you have probably noticed when listening to someone speaking an unfamiliar foreign language. This makes it hard to decide when one word ends and the next begins. (2) There is coarticulation: a speaker’s pronunciation of a phoneme depends on the preceding and following phonemes. Harley (2010, p. 148) provides an example: “The /b/ phonemes in ‘bill’, ‘ball’, ‘able’, and ‘rub’ are all acoustically slightly different.” Coarticulation is problematical because it increases the variability of the speech signal. However, it can provide a useful cue, because it allows listeners to predict the next phoneme to some extent. (3) Speakers differ in several ways (e.g., sex; dialect; speaking rate) and yet we generally cope well with such variability. Kriengwatana et al. (2016) trained Dutch and Australian-English listeners to discriminate two Dutch vowels from a single speaker. Both groups subsequently successfully categorised the same vowels when spoken by a speaker of the opposite sex. However, both groups performed poorly and required feedback when the vowels were spoken by someone with a different accent. Thus, adapting to a different-sexed speaker is relatively “automatic” but adapting to a different accent requires active processing of additional information (e.g., feedback; context). Expectations are important (Magnuson & Nusbaum, 2007). Some listeners expected to hear two speakers with similar voices whereas others expected to hear only one speaker. In fact, there was only one speaker. Those expecting two speakers showed worse listening performance. (4) Language is spoken at 10 phonemes (basic speech sounds) per second and much acoustic information is lost within 50 ms (Remez et al., 2010). As a consequence, “If linguistic information is not processed rapidly, that information is lost for good” Christiansen & Chater, 2016, p. 1). (5) Non-native speakers often produce speech errors (e.g., saying words in the wrong order). Listeners cope by using top-down processes to infer what non-native speakers are trying to say (Lev-Ari, 2014; see Chapter 10). Coping with listening problems We have seen listeners experience various problems in understanding the speech signal. How do they cope? Multiple sources of information are used flexibly depending on the immediate situation. There are bottom-up pro- cesses stemming directly from the acoustic signal. There are also top-down processes based on the listener’s past knowledge and contextual informa- tion (e.g., the speaker’s previous utterance). Below we discuss how these processes assist speech perception. Segmentation Dividing the speech signal into its constituent words (i.e., segmentation) is crucial for listeners. Segmentation involves using several cues. Some are KEY TERM Coarticulation A speaker’s production of a phoneme is influenced by their production of the previous sound and by preparations for the next sound.

Segmentation is influenced by constraints on what words are possible (e.g., a stretch of speech lacking a vowel is not a possible word in English). Listeners found it hard to identify the word apple in fapple because fapple could not possibly be an English word (Morris et al., 1997). In contrast, listeners easily detected the word apple in wuffapple because wuff could be an English word. Evidence indicating segmentation can be based on possible word con- straints has been obtained in several languages. However, it does not apply to Russian, a language which has some single-consonant words lacking a vowel (Alexeeva et al., 2017). Stress is an important acoustic cue. In English, the initial syllable of most content words (e.g., nouns; verbs) is typically stressed. Strings of words without the stress on the first syllable are misperceived (e.g., “conduct ascents uphill” is perceived as “A duck descends some pill”). There are other acoustic cues. For example, there is generally more coarticulation within than between words. In addition, segments and sylla- bles at the start and end of words are lengthened relative to those in the middle (Kim et al., 2012). Mattys et al. (2005) identified three main categories of cues: lexical (e.g., syntax; word knowledge); segmental (e.g., coarticulation); and metrical prosody (e.g., word stress) in his hierarchical approach (see Figure 9.3). When all cues are available, we prefer to use lexical cues (Tier 1). When lexical information is impoverished, we use segmental cues such as coarticulation and allophony (one phoneme may be associated with two or more similar sounds or allophones) (Tier 2). For example, the Figure 9.3 A hierarchical approach to speech segmentation involving three levels or tiers. The relative importance of the different types of cue is indicated by the width of the purple triangle. From Mattys et al. (2005). © American Psychological Association.

Finally, we resort to metrical prosody cues (e.g., stress) when it is hard to use Tier 1 or 2 cues. One reason we often avoid using stress cues is because stress information can be misleading when a word’s initial syllable is not stressed (Cutler & Butterfield, 1992). Mattys (2004) found coarticulation (Tier 2) was more useful than stress (Tier 3) for identifying word boundaries when the speech signal was intact. In contrast, when the speech signal was impoverished and made it hard to use Tier 1 or 2 cues, stress was more useful than coarticulation. Speaker variability Earlier we discussed problems listeners have when dealing with variations across speakers in accent, speaking rate, and so on. Cai et al. (2017) pro- posed a model to explain how listeners cope with variability (see Figure 9.4). They assumed listeners use information provided by the speech signal to infer characteristics of the speaker (i.e., to construct a speaker model) and this influences how speech is perceived. Cai et al. (2017) tested their model using words typically having some- what different meanings when heard in an American or English accent. For example, the American meaning of bonnet is usually hat whereas the British meaning is usually part of a car. As predicted, British listeners were more likely to interpret such words as having the American meaning when spoken in an American rather than British accent. The crucial condition involved presenting such words in a neutral accent. These words were presented in the context of other words spoken in an American or British accent. As predicted, the neutral words were more likely to be interpreted in their American meaning when the context consisted of words spoken in an American accent. Thus, the listeners’ speaker model biased their interpretations. McGurk effect Listeners (even with intact hearing) often make extensive use of lip- reading when listening to speech. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) pro- vided a striking demonstration of the McGurk effect (reviewed by Marques et al., 2016). They prepared a videotape of someone saying “ba” repeatedly. Then the sound channel changed so there was a voice saying “ga” repeatedly in synchronisation with lip movements still indi- cating “ba”. Listeners reported hearing “da”, a blending of the visual and auditory information (see this on YouTube: “McGurk effect (with explanation)”. On average, the McGurk effect is strongest when the auditory input lags 100 ms behind the visual input (Ipser et al., 2017). This probably happens because lip movements can be used predictively to anticipate the next sound to be produced. Soto-Faraco and Alsius (2009) found the McGurk effect is unexpectedly robust: listeners showed the effect even when they were aware of a temporal mismatch between the visual and auditory input (one started before the other). KEY TERM McGurk effect A mismatch between spoken and visual (lip- based) information leads listeners to perceive a sound or word involving a blending of the auditory and visual information.

There are several types of con- textual information including that provided by previous input (e.g., earlier parts of a sentence) and that provided by our knowledge of language and words.

However, it is hard to clarify when and how context exerts its influ- ence. Harley (2013) identified two extreme positions. According to the interactionist account, contextual information influences processing at an early stage and may influence word perception. In contrast, the autonomous account claims context has its effects late in processing. According to this account: “context cannot have an effect prior to word recognition. It can only contribute to the evaluation and integration of the output of lexical processing, not its generation” (Harley, 2013). These theoretical approaches are discussed in the next section. Evidence that context can rapidly influence spoken word recognition was reported by Brock and Nation (2014). Participants viewed a display containing four objects and then heard a sentence. Their task was to click on any object mentioned in the sentence. In the first three conditions (see below), the sentence object was not in the display, but a critical distractor object was present: IN REAL LIFE: MISHEARD LYRICS AND MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE We easily mishear the lyrics of songs if provided with the wrong words (or context) beforehand. The comedian Peter Kay provides hilarious examples (YouTube: “Peter Kay Misheard Lyrics”). For example, he suggested the song “My heart will go on” from the Titanic movie contains the line “I believe the hot dogs go on” instead of the actual line “I believe the heart does go on”. The effect is strong – the first author cannot stop misperceiving that line! As Liden et al. (2016, p. 12) pointed out, song lyrics are susceptible to misperception because of “atypical pronuncia- tion resulting in ambivalent speech signals in combination with . . . the presence of other acoustic signals (i.e., the instrumental music)”. Misleading context leading to misperceptions can have serious consequences when we consider the use of covert recordings of suspects in criminal trials. These recordings are often indistinct, and so what happens is that detectives provide a transcript of their interpretation of what was said. If this transcript is incorrect (perhaps because detectives assume the suspect is guilty), this can strongly bias what jurors believe they hear (Fraser, 2018a). Consider the real-life case of a man sentenced to a 30-year prison sentence for murder largely because of an inaccurate police transcript. Hear the crucial recording at forensictranscription.com. au/audio (the one-minute recording is under the heading “‘Assisting’ listeners to hear words that aren’t there”). What do you think the man is saying? Jurors at the trial were told what a detective claimed to hear (given at the bottom of this Box). Fraser (2018b) carried out an experiment in which listeners initially heard the recording without any context. No listeners reported hearing anything like the incriminating sentence. When primed with the detective’s transcript, however, 15% said they definitely heard that sentence and 16% said they thought they heard it. In sum, top-down effects of context can be so strong that they lead listeners to misperceive speech. Such effects can be durable. Many listeners told explicitly they were being given incorrect words for a song (visual context) subsequently misperceived the song lyrics in the absence of the misleading visual context (Beck et al., 2014a).

When the sentence context made the critical object improbable (condition 1), participants were far less likely to fixate it than when the sentence context was less constraining (condition 2). This difference was apparent early on and indicates sentence context has almost immediate effects on word processing. This is consistent with the interac- tionist account. In what follows, we discuss various context effects. These effects will be related to the interactionist and autonomous accounts. Phonemic restoration effect Warren and Warren (1970) obtained strong evidence that sentence context can influence phoneme perception in the phonemic restoration effect. Listeners heard a sentence with a missing phoneme that had been replaced with a meaningless sound (cough). The sentences used were as follows (* = missing phoneme): ● It was found that the *eel was on the axle. ● It was found that the *eel was on the shoe. ● It was found that the *eel was on the table. ● It was found that the *eel was on the orange. The perception of the crucial element in the sentence (i.e., *eel) was influenced by the sentence in which it appeared. Participants listening to the first sentence heard wheel, those listening to the second sentence heard heel, and those exposed to the third and fourth sentences heard meal and peel, respectively. The crucial auditory stimulus (i.e., *eel) was always the same so all that differed was the contextual information. What causes the phonemic restoration effect? There may be a fairly direct effect on speech processing, with the missing phoneme being pro- cessed almost as if it were present (Samuel, 2011). Alternatively, there may an indirect effect with listeners guessing the identity of the missing phoneme after basic speech processing has occurred. Leonard et al. (2016) obtained findings strongly supporting the notion of a direct effect. The noise input was followed almost immediately by activa- tion in language areas within the left frontal cortex associated with predicting Figure 9.5 Gaze probability for critical objects over the first 1,000 ms since target word onset for target neutral, competitor neutral, competitor constraining and unrelated neutral conditions (described in text).

This was followed very rapidly by appropri- ate phonemic processing in the auditory cortex. This latter finding strongly suggests a direct effect consistent with the interactionist perspective rather than an indirect effect consistent with the autonomous approach. Ganong effect Earlier we saw listeners often show categorical perception (see p. 405), with speech signals intermediate between two phonemes being categorised as one phoneme or the other. Ganong (1980) wondered whether categorical perception of phonemes would be influenced by the immediate context. Accordingly, he presented listeners with various sounds ranging between a word (e.g., dash) and a non-word (e.g., tash). There was a context effect – an ambiguous initial phoneme was more likely to be assigned to a given phoneme category when it produced a word. This is the Ganong effect. In order to understand the processes underlying the Ganong effect, it is important to ascertain when lexical (word-based) processing influences phonemic processing. Kingston et al. (2016) obtained clear evidence on this issue. Listeners categorised phonemes by choosing between two visually presented options (one completing a word and the other not). Listeners directed their eye movements to the word-completing option almost imme- diately. This finding strongly suggests there is a remarkably rapid merging of phonemic and lexical processing. This seems inconsistent with the notion that phonemic processing is completed prior to the use of word- based processing. Interactionist vs autonomous accounts So far we have considered how contextual information is used with respect to specific phenomena (phonemic restoration effect; Ganong effect). More broadly, we can consider the role of prediction in spoken word recognition. Predictive influences should generally occur more rapidly on interactionist than autonomous accounts (see Kuperberg and Jaeger, 2016, for a review). Van Berkum et al. (2005) presented sentences in Dutch such as the following: The burglar had no trouble locating the secret family safe. Of course, it was situated behind a . . . It is reasonable to predict the following noun will be painting, which has the neuter gender in Dutch. The word a was followed by the Dutch adjective big in the neuter gender or common gender. Event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) to the adjective differed depending on whether its gender was consistent with the predicted noun (i.e., painting). Thus, story context can influence speech processing before the predicted word is presented. In similar fashion, Grisoni et al. (2017) presented spoken sentences in which the final word was relatively easy to predict (e.g., “I take the pen and I [write]”; “I take some grapes and I [eat]”). Patterns of brain activity reflected the meaning of the predicted final word before it was presented. More specifically, brain areas associated with hand-related actions were KEY TERM Ganong effect The finding that perception of an ambiguous phoneme is biased towards a sound that produces a word rather than a non-word.

Further evidence supporting the interactionist position was reported by Wild et al. (2012; see also Chapter 1). Listeners heard sentences presented in clear speech or degraded (but potentially intelligible) speech. Each sentence was accompanied by context: a text matching the spoken words or a random consonant string. The rated perceptual clarity of the sentences was greater when they were accompanied by matching text. How can we explain the above context effect? According to the interactionist position, matching context might influence the early stages of spoken word processing within primary auditory cortex. In contrast, it follows from the autonomous position that context should influence only later processing stages and so should not influence processing in the primary auditory cortex. The findings were entirely consistent with the interactionist position. In similar fashion, Sohoglu et al. (2014) found the perceived clarity of a degraded spoken word was greater when preceded by written text (context) containing that word. However, when the same contextual information was presented after a spoken word, it had very little effect on the word’s perceived clarity. This seems inconsistent with the autonomous position, according to which context has its effects late in processing. Finally, we return to Wild et al.’s (2012) study. There was no effect of matching context on activation within primary motor cortex when sen- tences were presented in clear speech. Why do these findings differ from those with degraded speech? Speech perception was so straightforward with clear speech there was no need (and also insufficient time) for context to activate primary auditory cortex. Overall evaluation Research on context effects (including the Ganong and phonemic restora- tion effects) mostly indicates context can influence early stages of speech perception. It is thus more supportive of the interactionist position than the autonomous one. This issue is discussed again later when we consider theo- ries of speech perception (see pp. 417–429). There are two qualifications on the conclusion that top-down effects of context influence the early stages of speech perception. First, such effects are less likely to be found when speech is clear and unambigu- ous (e.g., Wild et al., 2012). Top-down processes may often be unnec- essary when bottom-up processes provide ample information for word recognition. Second, much research on context effects in spoken word recognition (e.g., Grisoni et al., 2017) has used sentence contexts in which the target word is highly predictable. Huettig and Mani (2016) argued that top- down influences may be much weaker when prediction is harder (as is often the case in real life). In addition, listeners may often not engage in top-down predictive processes because they are too demanding of resources.

Some of these theories also explain findings on segmentation and context effects discussed earlier. As we have seen, phonological processing plays a major role in speech perception. We start by considering whether orthographic processing (pro- cessing related to word spellings) is also involved. Then we discuss major theories of spoken word recognition. First, we consider the motor theory of speech perception (e.g., Liberman et al., 1967), followed by a discus- sion of the TRACE and cohort models. The TRACE model (McClelland & Elman, 1986) claims word recognition involves interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes. The original cohort model (Marslen- Wilson & Tyler, 1980) also emphasised such interactions. Subsequently, Marslen-Wilson (e.g., 1990) revised his cohort model to increase the emphasis on bottom-up processes driven by the speech signal. Orthographic influences Suppose you listen to spoken words. Would this activate their spellings? Chiarello et al. (2018) studied spoken word identification under difficult conditions (multi-speaker babble). The researchers computed the propor- tion of similar sounding words (phonological neighbours) also spelled simi- larly (orthographic neighbours) for each spoken word. Word identification rates were lower for words having many orthographic neighbours as well as phonological neighbours. Thus, word identification was influenced by orthography. How does orthography influence speech perception? Perhaps hearing a word leads fairly “automatically” to activation of its orthographic codes and so influences lexical access. Alternatively, a spoken word’s orthogra- phy may influence its processing only after lexical access. This issue has been addressed using event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary). Pattamadilok et al. (2011) asked listeners to decide whether spoken words had a given final syllable. Orthographic information influenced ERPs at 175–250 ms, suggesting orthography affects early processing prior to lexical access (lexical access is often reflected in the N400 component of the ERP occurring 400 ms after word onset). In similar fashion, Kwon et al. (2016) found, with the Korean language, that orthographic informa- tion influenced the P200 component of the ERP (occurring between 150 and 300 ms) on a spoken word recognition task. Finally, Pattamadilok et al. (2011) reviewed research indicating that orthographic information often influences word processing 300–350 ms after word onset. Such findings suggest orthographic information can influence various stages of word processing. Motor theory Liberman et al. (1967) argued that a key issue is explaining how listeners perceive spoken words accurately even though the speech signal is varia- ble. In their motor theory, they proposed listeners mimic the speaker’s KEY TERMS Lexical access Accessing detailed information about a given word by entering the lexicon.

It was claimed this motor signal provides much less variable and inconsistent information about the speaker’s words than does the speech signal and so facilitates speech perception. Halle and Stevens (1962) also emphasised the role of speech- production processes in speech perception. They proposed an analysis-by- synthesis approach where “Cues from the input signal triggered guesses about the identity of phonemes [using speech-production processes], and subsequently, the internal synthesis of potential phonemes is compared to the input sequence” (Poeppel & Monahan, 2011, p. 2). Thus, speech- production processes predict the speech input and enhance speech percep- tion when the speech signal is ambiguous. Much research has assumed there is a single motor speech system. This is a drastic oversimplification. There are actually several motor systems or networks, but their precise number and nature remain unclear (Skipper et al., 2017). Findings According to motor theories, the brain areas activated during speech per- ception and speech production should overlap substantially, whereas such overlap should be limited if speech-production processes are not involved in speech perception. Skipper et al. (2017) reported a meta-analysis com- paring activation during speech perception and production. Several areas were common to speech perception and speech production, including the pars opercularis, ventral central sulcus, ventral precentral sulcus and gyrus, supplementary motor area, and anterior insula. The above meta-analysis was concerned only with perception and production of words and non-words. Silbert et al. (2014) reported a more naturalistic study assessing brain areas activated during production and perception of a 15-minute spoken narrative. They divided brain areas acti- vated during both perception and production into those where activity was correlated or coupled over time and those where it was not coupled. An absence of coupling may mean a given area is used for different functions during speech perception and speech production. What did Silbert et al. (2014) find? Several brain areas exhibited perception–production coupling (see Figure 11.1 in Chapter 11). These areas included the superior temporal gyrus, the medial temporal gyrus, the temporal pole, the angular gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus, the insula and the premotor cortex. The above neuroimaging research is inconclusive because listeners may use speech-production processes only following speech perception. More direct evidence can be obtained by applying transcranial magnetic stimula- tion (TMS; see Glossary) to part of the speech-production system during a speech-perception task to influence its functioning. Liebenthal and Möttönen (2018) concluded their review of TMS research as follows: “Disruptions in the articulatory motor areas impair speech perception and modulate early . . . processing of speech sounds in the auditory areas” (p. 38). Thus, processes in speech-production areas can causally influence speech perception. Additional support for motor theories comes from studies using event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary).

Thus, speech-production pro- cesses occur early enough to influence speech perception. Listeners sometimes make more use of speech-production processes when the speech input is unclear and provides insufficient auditory infor- mation. For example, Nuttall et al. (2016) found listeners had greater acti- vation in the motor cortex when speech perception was made harder (e.g., presented with background noise). However, they used rather artificial speech stimuli (i.e., syllables). In contrast, Panouillères et al. (2018) pre- sented more naturalistic sentences. Speech-production areas were involved in speech processing to the same extent regardless of the extent to which noise reduced the clarity of the speech input. Evidence from brain-damaged patients might clarify the role of motor processes in speech perception. If patients whose motor cortex is destroyed can still perceive speech, we might conclude motor processes are unnec- essary for speech perception. This approach is simplistic, because many different brain areas are involved in speech production (see Figure 11.1). However, the overall picture is clear: “Speech perception deteriorates with a wide range of damage to speech-production systems caused by stroke, focal excitation for epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease” (Skipper et al., 2017, p. 95). Finally, we consider an important study by Uddin et al. (2018). They focused on how long a target needed to be presented for listeners to rec- ognise it when presented in isolation or within a relevant sentence context. The target was a noun that could be represented by a word (e.g., sheep) or by a sound (e.g., a sheep bleating). What would we expect to find according to the motor-theory approach? First, there should be a beneficial effect of sentence context on speed of target identification because context facilitates prediction of the final sound. Second, and more importantly, the context effect should be much greater when the target is a word. Why is that? As Uddin et al. pointed out, “It is not possible to make neural predictions via motor systems [for] environmental sounds [that] do not have clear speech . . . rep- resentations” (p. 140). However, the context effect was as great with the environmental sounds as the words (see Figure 9.6). Thus, listen- ers make predictions at the level of conceptual meaning (i.e., predicting the meaning that will be represented by the target sound rather than the sound itself). Evaluation As Skipper et al. (2017, p. 97) concluded their review, “Brain regions and networks involved in speech production are ubiquitously involved in speech perception.” This conclusion is supported by several kinds of evidence: (1) neuroimaging evidence for overlapping brain areas for speech percep- tion and speech production; (2) rapid activation of motor areas during speech perception revealed by research using event-related potentials; Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["s using event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary).","The key finding is that Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

What are the limitations of motor theories? First, Uddin et al.’s (2018) findings suggest listeners do not simply predict the sounds that will be pre- sented. Instead, most theories of speech perception (including motor the- ories) “should be modified to include a larger contribution from general cognitive processes that take conceptual meaning into account” (Uddin et al., 2018, p. 141). Second, the available evidence suggests, “Multiple speech production- related networks and sub-networks dynamically self-organise to con- strain interpretations of indeterminate acoustic patterns as listening context requires” (Skipper et al., 2017, p. 77). No theory explains these complexities. Third, many brain areas are involved in speech perception but not speech production (see Figure 11.1). Thus, motor theories would need development to provide comprehensive accounts of speech perception. Fourth, when speech input is clear, comprehension can be achieved with minimal involvement of speech-production processes. That may limit the applicability of motor theories to speech perception in typical conditions. TRACE model McClelland and Elman (1986) proposed a network model of speech perception based on connectionist principles (see Chapter 1). Their TRACE model assumes bottom-up and top-down processes interact flexibly in spoken word recognition. It makes the following assumptions (see Figure 9.7): ● There are individual processing units or nodes at three different levels: features (e.g., voicing; manner of production); phonemes; and words.

The word with the strongest activation wins the competition. ● “Words are recognised incrementally by slowly ramping up the activa- tion of the correct words at the phoneme and word levels” (Joanisse & McClelland, 2015, p. 237). The TRACE model assumes bottom-up and top-down processes inter- act. Bottom-up activation proceeds upwards from the feature level to the phoneme level and on to the word level. In contrast, top-down activation proceeds in the opposite direction from the word level to the phoneme level and on to the feature level. Findings Suppose participants hear the word beaker.

(2) Phonological competitors (beaker; speaker) should receive more fix- ations than an unrelated competitor (carriage) because of phonemic processing. (3) A phonological competitor sharing its first phoneme (beetle) with the spoken word should receive more fixations than a phonological com- petitor sharing its last phoneme (speaker) with the spoken word. Allopenna et al. (1998) carried out a study along the lines indicated above. Their findings are shown in Figure 9.8. As you can see, there was a reason- ably close fit between the behavioural data and predictions following from the model. Suppose we asked listeners to detect target phonemes presented in words and non-words. According to the TRACE model, performance should be better in the word condition. Why is that? In that condition, acti- vation from the word level to the phoneme level would facilitate phoneme detection. Mirman et al. (2008) required listeners to detect a target phoneme (/t/ or /k/) in words and non-words. Words were presented on 80% or 20% of trials. It was assumed attention to (and activation at) the word level would be greater when most auditory stimuli were words, which would increase the performance advantage in the word condition. What did Mirman et al. (2008) find? First, there was a consistent advantage for the word conditions over the non-word conditions (see Figure 9.9). Second, the magnitude of this effect was greater when 80% of the auditory stimuli were words. These findings indicate the involvement of top-down processes in speech perception. The TRACE model explains the basic Ganong effect (discussed earlier, p. 415) where there is a bias towards perceiving an ambiguous phoneme so a word is formed.

(2003) reported additional evidence that phoneme identification can be influenced directly by top-down processing. Listeners categorised ambiguous phonemes as /f/ or /s/. Those who had previously heard this phoneme in /f/-ending words favoured the /f/ categorisation, whereas those who had heard it in /s/-ending words favoured the /s/ categorisation. The TRACE model explains categori- cal speech perception (discussed earlier) by assuming the boundary between phonemes becomes sharper because of mutual inhibi- tion between phoneme units. These inhibitory processes produce a “winner takes all” situa- tion with one phoneme becoming increasingly more activated than other phonemes, thus producing categorical perception. High-frequency words (those encountered frequently) are generally recognised faster than low-frequency ones (Harley, 2013). It would be consistent with the TRACE model’s approach to assume this finding occurs because high-frequency words have higher resting activation levels. If so, word frequency should influence even early stages of word processing. Dufour et al. (2013) obtained supporting evidence. Word frequency influenced event-related potentials as early as 350 ms after word onset during spoken word recognition. We turn now to problematical findings for the model. It assumes top- down influences originate at the word level. Thus, top-down effects (e.g., produced by relevant context) should benefit target identification more when the target is a word (e.g., sheep) rather than an environmental sound (e.g., a sheep bleating). However, context effects are as great with environ- mental sounds as with words (Uddin et al., 2018; see Figure 9.6), suggest- ing top-down processing activates general conceptual meanings rather than specific words. Frauenfelder et al. (1990) asked listeners to detect a given phoneme. In the key condition, a non-word closely resembling an actual word was presented (e.g., vocabutaire instead of vocabulaire). The model predicts top-down effects from the word node corresponding to vocabulaire should have impaired the task of identifying the t in vocabutaire. However, they did not. McQueen (1991) asked listeners to categorise ambiguous phonemes at the end of auditory stimuli. Each ambiguous phoneme could be interpreted as completing a word or non-word. The TRACE model predicts listeners should have shown a preference for perceiving the phonemes as completing words. This prediction was confirmed when the stimulus was degraded but not when it was not degraded. The TRACE model ignores the role of context provided by verbs in influencing spoken word recognition. Rohde and Ettlinger (2012) presented Figure 9.9 Mean reaction times (in ms) for recognition of /t/ and /k/ phonemes in words and non-words when words were presented on a high (80%) or low (20%) proportion of trials.

(2) Luis reproached Heidi because ___ was getting grouchy. They predicted (and found) that listeners would hear the ambiguous phoneme as she in both sentences. Annoyed is typically followed by a pronoun refer- ring to the subject, whereas reproached is followed by a pronoun referring to the object. Zhang and Samuel (2018) investigated the effects of cognitive load (in the form of a phonological load) on speech perception. The effects were much greater on later processing (maintaining competing word candidates) than earlier processing (lexical access: see Glossary). Thus, early processes are more “automatic” than later ones. These findings are inconsistent with the TRACE model, which “makes no distinctions in terms of automaticity of sub-processes during speech recognition” (p. 43). Evaluation The TRACE model has several successes to its credit. First, even though it was proposed in 1986, “The rate of citations of the original work has increased since 2001” (Joanisse & McClelland, 2015, p. 238). Second, it provides plausible accounts of phenomena such as the pho- nemic restoration effect, categorical perception, the Ganong effect and the word superiority effect in phoneme monitoring. Third, the TRACE model assumes bottom-up and top-down processes both contribute directly to spoken word recognition. As such, it is an excel- lent example of the interactionist approach (discussed earlier, pp. 415–416). Fourth, the TRACE model “copes extremely well with noisy input – which is a considerable advantage given the noise present in natural language” (Harley, 2013). It does so through its emphasis on top-down processes that become increasingly important when the speech input is degraded and so provides only limited information. What are the model’s limitations? First, its focus is rather narrow, being on word recognition, and it has little to say about speech comprehension. Second, the model assumes top-down processes influence the activa- tion of specific words. However, Uddin et al.’s (2018) findings indicate top-down processes can initially activate higher-level conceptual meanings rather than specific words. Thus, the model would be enhanced by adding a conceptual meaning level above the word level (see Figure 9.7). Third, the model sometimes exaggerates the importance of top-down effects on speech perception. More specifically, the model predicts top- down activation from the word level will cause mispronunciations and ambiguous sounds to be identified as words more often than actually happens (Frauenfelder et al., 1990; McQueen, 1991). Fourth, the TRACE model incorporates many different theoreti- cal assumptions. This may make the model “too powerful, in that it can accommodate any result” (Harley, 2013).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nSpeech perception and reading 425 Fifth, the model is incomplete in various ways. For example, it ignores the impact of orthographic information on speech perception. It also cannot account for the differential effects of cognitive load on early and late speech-perception processes. Sixth, Gwilliams et al. (2018) found that the primary auditory cortex was sensitive to ambiguity in a word’s initial phoneme only 50 ms after word onset. None of the assumptions incorporated within the TRACE model provide an explanation of this rapid effect. Cohort model The cohort model focuses on the processes involved during spoken word recognition. It differs from the TRACE model in focusing more on bottom-up processes and less on top-down ones. Several versions have been proposed, starting with Marslen-Wilson and Tyler (1980). Here are the main assumptions of the original version: ● Early in the auditory presentation of a word, all words conform- ing to the sound sequence heard so far become active: this is the word-initial cohort. There is competition among these words to be selected. ● Words within the cohort are eliminated if they cease to match further information from the presented word or because they are inconsistent with the semantic or other context. For example, crocodile and crock- ery might both belong to the initial cohort with the latter word being excluded when the sound /d/ is heard. ● Processing continues until information from the word itself and con- textual information permit elimination of all but one of the cohort words. The uniqueness point is the point at which only one word is consistent with the acoustic signal. How do later versions of the cohort model differ from the original version? In the original model, it was assumed any word was in or out of the cohort at a given moment. This assumption is too extreme. In revised versions of the model (e.g., Marslen-Wilson, 1987, 1990), it is assumed words vary in their level of activation and so membership of the word cohort is a matter of degree. Marslen-Wilson also assumed the word- initial cohort may contain words having similar initial phonemes to the pre- sented word rather than consisting only of words having the same initial phoneme. In the original version of the model, it was assumed words not match- ing the context (e.g., preceding words) drop out of the word cohort. As Marslen-Wilson (1987) pointed out, this assumption is too extreme. For example, suppose you heard the sentence, “John slept the guitar”, in which the word guitar is totally inappropriate in the sentence context. However, it was nearly always accurately perceived reasonably rapidly (320 ms on average). In the revised version, it is assumed context-inappropriate words are eliminated later in processing (see below). Three processing stages are identified within the cohort model (Marslen-Wilson, 1987): KEY TERM Uniqueness point The point in time in spoken word recognition at which the available perceptual information is consistent with only one word.

According to the model’s original version, context influences the selection process. In the revised version, in contrast, “Context plays no role in the processes of access and selection” (Marslen-Wilson, 1987, p. 71). The assumptions of the revised model are more flexible than the orig- inal ones. As we will see shortly, they predict processes in spoken word recognition more accurately. Finally, Gaskell and Marslen-Wilson (2002) proposed another variant of the cohort model. Its central assumption was that there is “continu- ous integration” of information from the speech input and context. If the speech input is degraded or the context is strongly predictive, top-down processes relating to prediction of the next word are likely to dominate within this continuous integration. In contrast, bottom-up processes triggered by the speech signal are dominant within continuous integra- tion if the speech signal is unambiguous and there is no constraining context. Findings Evidence the initial phoneme of a spoken word is often especially impor- tant was reported by Allopenna et al. (1998; discussed earlier, p. 422). For example, when listeners heard the word beaker, the competition from a word starting with the same phoneme (e.g., beetle) was greater than from a rhyming competitor having the same last phoneme (e.g., speaker). McQueen and Huettig (2012) replicated this finding. According to the original version of the model (Marslen-Wilson, 1987), spoken words would not be recognised if their initial phoneme was unclear or ambiguous. Contrary evidence was reported by Frauenfelder et al. (2001). French-speaking listeners activated words even when the initial phoneme of spoken words was distorted (e.g., hearing focabulaire activated the word vocabulaire). However, the listeners took some time to overcome the effects of the mismatch in the initial phoneme. We now consider evidence that spoken words are identified when their uniqueness point (see p. 425) is reached. O’Rourke and Holcomb (2012) presented words with an early uniqueness point (mean of 427 ms after onset) and those with a late uniqueness point (mean of 533 ms after onset). They used event-related potentials and focused on the N400 component. The N400 (reflecting access to word meaning) occurred 100 ms earlier for words having an early uniqueness point. Kocagoncu et al. (2017) used magneto-encephalography (MEG; see Glossary) while presenting spoken words with varying uniqueness points. As predicted, each word’s uniqueness point was associated with increased semantic processing of that word plus a marked reduction in lexical and semantic processing of competitor words. The latter finding was predicted because all competitor words have been eliminated from the word cohort when the uniqueness point is reached.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nSpeech perception and reading 427 Access to word meaning sometimes occurs prior to the uniqueness point if the preceding context is very constraining. Van Petten et al. (1999) presented listeners with sentence frames (e.g., Sir Lancelot spared the man’s life when he begged for ____ ) followed by a contextually congruent (e.g., mercy) or incongruent (e.g., mermaid) word. There were differences in the N400 to contextually congruent and incongruent words 200 ms before the uniqueness point. However, as Nieuwland (2019) pointed out, word rec- ognition prior to the uniqueness point probably occurs only in those rare situations where a spoken word is very predictable within its context. How does context influence word-recognition processes? According to the revised version of the model, context influences only the later stages of word recognition. Zwitserlood (1989) supported this assumption. Listeners performed a lexical decision task (deciding whether visually pre- sented letter strings were words) immediately after hearing part of a word. When only cap ___ had been presented, it was consistent with captain and capital. Lexical decisions were faster when the presented word was related in meaning to either word (e.g., ship; money). In another condition, the part word was preceded by a biasing context (e.g., With dampened spirits the men stood around the grave. They mourned the loss of their cap ___ ). As predicted, such context did not prevent acti- vation of the word capital even though it was inconsistent with the context. In a similar study, Friedrich and Kotz (2007) presented sentences ending with incomplete words (e.g. To light up the dark she needed her can ___ ). Immediately afterwards, listeners saw a visual word matched to the incomplete word in form and meaning (e.g., candle), in meaning only (e.g., lantern), in form only (e.g., candy) or in neither (e.g., number). As predicted by the cohort model, the word candy was activated even though it was inconsistent with the context. However, Weber and Crocker (2012) found context can sometimes exert a very early influence on speech processing. Listeners heard German sentences (e.g., The woman irons the ____. Bluse (German for blouse) is a likely final word whereas the similar-sounding word Blume (meaning flower) is implausible. Weber and Crocker studied eye fixations to pictures of the target word (e.g., Bluse), a similar-sounding word (e.g., Blume), and an irrelevant distractor (e.g., Wolke meaning cloud). Context had a powerful effect. More fixations were directed at the target object than the other objects before the final word was presented and this tendency increased during and after its presentation (see Figure 9.10). However, similar-sounding words were fixated more than irrelevant dis- tractors shortly after the final word in the sentence was presented. Thus, as predicted by the cohort model, words phonologically related to a spoken word were activated even when inconsistent with the context. Finally, we consider the notion of “continuous integration” (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 2002). As predicted by this approach, context often influences the early stages of word processing via top-down processes (see above, pp. 412–416). Theoretically, the extent of such contextual effects should also depend in part on bottom-up influences from the to-be- recognised word itself. Supporting evidence for the above predictions was reported by Strand et al. (2018).

In addition, the phonologically similar distractor (i.e., run) was not fixated more than the phonologically dissimilar distractors (i.e., bench; pray). However, the word run was fixated more than other dis- tractors when pronounced to sound more similar to the target. What is the take-home message from the above findings? As predicted by Gaskell and Marslen-Wilson’s (2002) approach, “Listeners make use of contextual constraints very early in word processing while remaining sen- sitive to bottom-up acoustic input as words unfold” (Strand et al., 2018, p. 969). Evaluation The cohort model has several strengths. First, the assumption that accurate perception of a spoken word is typically accompanied by some processing of several competitor words is generally correct. Second, the processing of spoken words is sequential and changes considerably during the course of their presentation. Third, the uniqueness point is of great importance in spoken word recognition. Fourth, context effects often (but not always) occur during the integration stage following word identification as pre- dicted by the model. Fifth, the revised versions of the model are superior to the original version. For example, the assumption that membership of the word cohort is a matter of degree rather than all-or-none is more in line with the evidence. What are the model’s limitations? First, context sometimes influences word processing earlier than the integration stage. This is especially the case when the context is strongly predictive (e.g., Grisoni et al., 2017; dis- cussed earlier, p. 415) or the speech input is degraded (e.g., Wild et al., 2012; discussed earlier, p. 416). However, Gaskell and Marslen-Wilson’s (2002) more flexible approach based on continuous integration can accom- modate these (and many other) findings. Second, the revised cohort model de-emphasises the role of word meaning in spoken word recognition. One aspect of word meaning is imageability (ease of forming an image of a word’s referent). When there are many words in the word cohort, high-imageability words are easier to recognise than low-imageability ones (Tyler et al., 2000) and they are asso- ciated with greater activation in brain areas involved in speech perception (Zhuang et al., 2011). Thus, word selection depends on semantic factors as well as phonological ones. Third, mechanisms involved in spoken word recognition may differ from those emphasised within the model. More specifically, predictive coding and enhanced processing of speech features inconsistent with prediction may be more important than assumed within the cohort model.

Our focus will be on repeating spoken words immediately after hearing them. We will use the theoretical framework proposed by Ellis and Young (1988; see Figure 9.12). There are five components: ● The auditory analysis system extracts phonemes or other sounds from the speech wave. ● The auditory input lexicon contains information about spoken words known to the listener but not about their meaning. ● Word meanings are stored in the semantic system. ● The speech output lexicon provides the spoken form of words. ● The phoneme response buffer provides distinctive speech sounds. The framework’s most striking assumption is that three different routes can be used when saying spoken words. We will discuss these routes after con- sidering the auditory analysis system. Auditory analysis system Consider patients with damage only to the auditory analysis system causing deficient phonemic processing. The expected consequences are found in patients with pure word deafness: “an inability to understand spoken lan- guage in the absence of any other linguistic disturbance . . . [they] are per- fectly capable of speaking, writing, and reading” (Kasselimis et al., 2017, Figure 9.12 Processing and repetition of spoken words according to the three-route framework. Adapted from Ellis and Young (1988).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nSpeech perception and reading 431 p. 11). Of importance, such patients should have intact perception for non- speech sounds (e.g., whistles) not containing phonemes. Maffei et al. (2017) studied a female patient (FO) with pure word deafness. She had a selective impairment in auditory language processing but intact processing of environmental sounds and music (e.g., identifying which musical instrument was being played). She also had intact speech, reading and writing. Unsurprisingly, FO had damage to regions of a brain network dedicated to speech sound processing. Slevc et al. (2011) argued that speech perception differs from the per- ception of most non-speech sounds because listeners must cope with rapid stimulus changes. They found NL, a patient with pure word deafness, had great difficulties discriminating sounds (speech or non-speech) differing in rapid temporal changes. Thus, the rapid stimulus changes in spoken words may partially explain why patients with pure word deafness have severe speech-perception problems. Three-route framework Ellis and Young’s (1988) framework specifies three routes that can be used when individuals process and repeat words they have just heard (see Figure 9.12). All three routes involve the auditory analysis system and the phonemic response buffer. Route 1 also involves the other three components (auditory input lexicon; semantic system; speech output lexicon). Route 2 involves two additional components (auditory input lexicon; speech output lexicon), and Route 3 involves an additional rule-based system converting acoustic information into words that can be spoken. According to the three-route framework, Routes 1 and 2 are used with unfamiliar words and non-words. Findings Patients using predominantly Route 2 should recognise familiar words but not understand their meaning. Since they can use the input lexicon, they should distinguish between words and non-words. Finally, they should have problems saying unfamiliar words and non-words. Patients with word meaning deafness fit the above description. For example, Dr O had rea- sonable use of the input lexicon as shown by his excellent ability to dis- tinguish between words and non-words (Franklin et al., 1996). O repeated words much more successfully than non-words (80% vs 7%, respectively). He had impaired auditory comprehension. However, he had intact written word comprehension indicating his semantic system was probably not damaged. BB, a female patient with word meaning deafness, could distinguish between words and non-words. She was severely impaired in identifying pictures matching spoken words but not when identifying pictures match- ing written words (Bormann & Weiller, 2012). Thus, BB could not access the meanings of spoken words although her semantic processing ability was intact. Patients using only Route 3 could repeat spoken words and non-words but would have very little comprehension of the words.

He repeated spoken words but had severely impaired auditory and reading comprehension. These findings suggested he had damage within the semantic system. Kwon et al. (2017) studied two patients with transcortical sensory aphasia. Their impaired auditory com- prehension appeared to be due to greatly decreased functional connectivity between language centres in the brain. Patients with deep dysphasia have extensive problems with speech perception and production. They make semantic errors when repeating spoken words by producing words related in meaning to those spoken (e.g., saying sky instead of cloud). They also have very impaired ability to repeat words and non-words. Ablinger et al. (2008) discussed findings from JR, a man with deep dysphasia. In spite of severely impaired speech perception, he was only slightly impaired at reading aloud words and non-words. We could explain deep dysphasia by arguing all three routes shown in Figure 9.12 are damaged. However, Jefferies et al. (2007) argued plau- sibly that the central problem in deep dysphasia is a general phonologi- cal impairment (i.e., impaired processing of word sounds). This produces semantic errors because it increases patients’ reliance on word meanings when repeating spoken words. Jefferies et al. (2007) found deep dysphasics had poor phonological production when repeating words, reading aloud and naming pictures. As predicted, they also performed very poorly on tasks involving manip- ulating phonology such as the phoneme subtraction task (e.g., remove the initial phoneme from cat). Furthermore, they showed speech percep- tion problems (e.g., impaired performance when deciding whether words rhymed). Evaluation The three-route framework is along the right lines. Patients have various problems with speech perception (and speech production) and evidence exists for all three routes. Conditions such as pure word deafness, word meaning deafness and transcortical sensory aphasia can readily be related to the framework. What are the limitations with this theoretical approach? First, it pro- vides only a sketch map of the underlying mechanisms. For example, what detailed processes occur within the semantic or auditory analy- sis systems? Second, it is sometimes hard to relate patients’ symptoms to the framework. For example, it is debatable whether deep dyspha- sia involves impairments to all three routes or a general phonological impairment.

Reading requires several perceptual and other cognitive processes plus a good knowledge of language and grammar.

For details, refer to text. From Perfetti and Stafura (2014). In this chapter, we focus mostly on basic processes used in reading single words. Research and theory relating to reading sentences and com- plete texts are discussed in Chapter 10. An overview of what is involved in reading across all these levels is shown in Figure 9.13. Here are its key features: (1) Reading requires various kinds of stored information: word meanings stored in a lexicon (mental dictionary); word spellings (orthographic knowledge); general knowledge about the world; and linguistic knowledge. (2) Readers use the above knowledge sources to produce word identifi- cation followed by text comprehension. Processes required for text comprehension include working out the syntactical or grammatical structure of each sentence (the parser), drawing inferences, and pro- ducing a situation model (an integrated mental representation). (3) The order in which reading processes occur is flexible. This is indi- cated in Figure 9.13 by bidirectional arrows (e.g., between the lexicon and comprehension processes). You may well feel (and you would be right!) that Figure 9.13 implies that reading involves many complex processes.

(2013) found English children learned to read more slowly than children learning more consistent lan- guages (e.g., Spanish or Czech; see Figure 9.14). Research methods Numerous methods are available for studying reading. For example, con- sider ways of assessing the time taken for word identification or recognition (e.g., deciding a word is familiar; accessing its meaning). The lexical deci- sion task involves deciding rapidly whether a letter string forms a word. The naming task involves saying a printed word out loud as rapidly as pos- sible. Both tasks have limitations. Normal reading times are disrupted by the requirement to respond to task demands and it is hard to identify the underlying processes. Balota et al. (1999) argued reading involves several kinds of process- ing: orthography (the spelling of words); phonology (the sound of words); semantics (word meaning); syntax or grammar; and higher-level discourse integration. The naming task emphasises links between orthography and phonology, whereas the lexical decision task emphasises links between orthography and semantics. Normal reading also involves processing of syntax and higher-level integration, processes irrelevant to naming or lexical decision. Recording eye movements provides an unobtrusive and detailed on-line record of attention-related processes. The main problem is deciding what processing occurs during each fixation (time period during which the eye remains still). Next there is priming (see Glossary) where a prime word is pre- sented shortly before the target word. This prime word is related to the target word in spelling, meaning or sound. What is of interest is to observe the effects of the prime on processing of (and response to) the KEY TERMS Lexical decision task Participants presented with a string of letters or auditory stimulus decide rapidly whether it forms a word.

A word preceded by a non-word having identical pronunciation (klip) presented below the level of conscious awareness is processed faster (Rastle & Brysbaert, 2006; see below, p. 436). Finally, there has been a dramatic increase in reading research using event-related potentials. ERPs provide a precise measure of the time taken for certain processes to occur. For example, consider the N400, a nega- tive wave peaking at about 400 ms after word onset. It has been assumed to reflect the time taken to access word meaning. More specifically, a large N400 often indicates a change in the meaning assigned to a word (Rabovsky et al., 2018; see Chapter 10). Phonological processes You are currently reading this sentence. Did you access the relevant sounds when identifying the words in it? More technically, did you engage in pho- nological processing of the words? We guess your answer is “Yes”, given that most readers experience an “inner voice” or “inner speech” during reading. For example, readers reading a text said they had engaged in inner speech immediately before being questioned on 59% of occasions (Moore & Schwitzgebel, 2018). However, subjective reports cannot demonstrate pho- nological processes play a causal role in the reading process. Various answers to the above questions have been proposed (Leinenger, 2014). Van Orden (1987) argued phonological processing is necessary very early in word reading because it plays a role in activating lexical entries (stored words). In contrast, Coltheart et al. (2001) argued phonological processing is relatively slow, and mostly inessential for word identification. Why might we expect phonological processing to be important? Children often learn to read using the phonics approach, which involves forming connections between letters or groups of letters and the sounds of spoken English (Share, 2008). Children’s early phonemic skills predict (and are probably causally related to) their future word-reading skills (Melby- Lervåg et al., 2012). Findings Much evidence supports the hypothesis that phonological processing is important in word reading. One approach involves the use of homophones (words with one pronunciation but two spellings). Van Orden (1987) found readers made many more errors when asked, “Is it a flower? ROWS”, than when asked, “Is it a flower? ROBS. The errors occurred because readers engaged in phonological processing of the word ROWS which is homo- phonic with the flower name ROSE. Jared and O’Donnell (2017) also used homophones. Eye movements were recorded while skilled adult readers read sentences such as: (1) Last night I made pasta for dinner; (2) Last night I maid pasta for dinner; and (3) Last night I mate pasta for dinner. Eye movements on incorrect sen- tences differed depending on whether the incorrect word was phonologically KEY TERM Homophones Words pronounced in the same way but that differ in their spellings (e.g., pain/ pane; sale/sail).

Thus, the readers used phonological processing. We can use phonological priming (mentioned earlier, p. 434), to assess the role of phonology in word processing. A word (e.g., clip) is immedi- ately preceded by a phonologically identical non-word prime (e.g., klip) presented below the level of conscious awareness. Rastle and Brysbaert (2006) found in a meta-analytic review that words were processed faster when preceded by phonologically identical non-word primes than by unre- lated primes. This suggests phonological processing of visually presented words occurs rapidly and automatically. Another approach involves the notion of phonological neighbour- hood. Two words are phonological neighbours if they differ in only one phoneme (e.g., gate has bait and get as neighbours). If reading involves phonological processing, word recognition should be influenced by the number of its phonological neighbours. This is the case (Carrasco-Ortiz et al., 2017). Phonological processing typically occurs during reading. However, such processing is not necessarily essential (e.g., it may occur after word recognition has occurred) and may simply be a byproduct of reading. However, various types of research support the hypothesis that phonolog- ical processing causally facilitates reading. First, phonological processing often starts within 80–100 ms of the first fixation on a word (Leinenger, 2014). That would be fast enough to influ- ence word recognition. For example, Sliwinska et al. (2012) found trans- cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) to the supramarginal gyrus (an area associated with phonological processing) 80 ms after word onset impaired performance on a phonological task. Second, we can study profoundly deaf adult readers who initially learned a sign language (e.g., American Sign Language) and so did not learn to read by reading aloud and sounding out the letters of words. They often make extensive use of phonological processing during the early stages of visual word recognition (Gutierrez-Sigut et al., 2017). Suggestive evidence that word meaning can be accessed without access to phonology was reported by Hanley and McDonnell (1997). Their patient, PS, could not gain access to the other meaning of homophones when he saw one of the spellings (e.g., air) and could not pronounce written words accurately. However, PS provided accurate definitions of printed words suggesting he had full access to the meanings of words for which he lacked the appropriate phonology. Similar findings were obtained from a Chinese male patient, YGA (Han & Bi, 2009). In sum, phonological processing is typically involved in reading and much evidence suggests it plays a causal role. However, the findings from patients with severely impaired phonological processing suggest some caution in assuming that is invariably the case. WORD RECOGNITION College students typically read at about 300 words per minute (200 ms per word). How long does word recognition take? It is hard to say because of imprecision about the meaning of the “word recognition”. The term can KEY TERM Phonological neighbourhood Words are phonological neighbours if they differ in only one phoneme (e.g. wipe, pipe and tap are phonological neighbours of type).

As a result, estimates of the time taken for word recognition vary. Interactive activation model McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) proposed an influential interactive activation model of visual word processing. It is a computa- tional model involving considerable parallel processing and based on the assumption that bottom-up and top-down processes interact (see Figure 9.15): ● There are recognition units at three levels: the feature level at the bottom; the letter level in the middle; and the word level at the top. ● When a feature in a letter is detected (e.g., vertical line at the right-hand side of a letter), activation goes to all letter units containing that feature (e.g., H, M, N), and inhibition goes to all other letter units. ● Letters are identified at the letter level. When a letter within a word is identified, activation is sent to the word level for all four-letter word units containing that letter in that position within the word, and inhi- bition is sent to all other word units. ● Words are recognised at the word level. Activated word units increase the level of activation in the letter-level units for that word’s letters. Findings Much research has used the following task. A letter string is presented very briefly followed by a pattern mask and participants decide which of two letters was presented in a given position (e.g., the third letter). Task performance is better when the letter string forms a word – the word superiority effect. This effect is explained by assuming there are top-down processes from the word to the letter level. Suppose the word SEAT is pre- sented and participants decide whether the third letter is A or N. If the word unit for SEAT is activated, this increases activation of A and inhibits activation of N. Sand et al. (2016) obtained the word superiority effect when stimuli were presented in central vision. However, the effect disappeared when stimuli were presented in peripheral vision. These findings suggest top- down processes from the word level do not apply in peripheral vision. Much research has considered orthographic neighbours (the words formed by changing one of a target word’s letters. For example, stem has Figure 9.15 McClelland and Rumelhart’s (1981) interactive activation model of visual word recognition. Adapted from Ellis (1984).

When a word is presented, its orthographic neighbours are activated and influence its rec- ognition time. Orthographic neighbours facilitate word recognition if they are less common than the word itself but have an inhibitory effect if they are more common. Chen and Mirman (2012) developed a computational model based on the interactive activation model’s assumptions (especially that common words are activated more than uncommon ones) to predict these findings. The model assumes each letter within a word is rigidly assigned to a specific position. As a consequence, “WROD is no more like WORD than is WXYD” (Norris & Kinoshita, 2012, p. 517). It follows that readers should have great problems reading the “Cambridge email: Aoccrdnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are. The olny iprmoatnt tihng is that the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can still raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcusease the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef but the wrod as a wlohe. In fact, most readers find it easy to read the Cambridge email even though numerous letters are transposed (Norris & Kinoshita, 2012). In the original research on this topic, however, transpositions involving the ending letters of words slowed reading rate by 26% (Rayner et al., 2006). Evaluation The interactive activation model was an early (and extremely influ- ential) example of how a connectionist model (see Chapter 1) could explain visual word processing. There is considerable support for its central assumption that “Participants in language-processing tasks use all the available information and start to show sensitivity to it within a third of a second” (McClelland et al., 2014, p. 1179). Within the model, this involves readers simultaneously using top-down and bottom-up processes. The model accounts for the word superiority effect and a revised version accounts for the effects of orthographic neighbours on word recognition. What are the model’s limitations? (1) The model is narrow in that it ignores the role of meaning in visual word recognition. It also ignores “how recognition processes may be influenced by surrounding words and contexts” (Snell et al., 2018, p. 969). (2) Phonological processing is often involved in word recognition (e.g., Jared & O’Donnell, 2017; discussed earlier, pp. 435–436), but that is not considered within the model. (3) The model exaggerates readers’ focus on the precise positions of letters within words. As Grainger (2018, p. 341) pointed out, “[Many] empirical findings . . . point to the need for a more flexible letter- position coding scheme.” For example, readers should struggle Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["t word, the number of words that can be formed by changing one of its letters.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

In similar fashion, the model cannot explain why the Cambridge email is easy to read. (4) The model’s accounts for the processing of four-letter words and its applicability to word recognition for longer words is unclear. Semantic priming Many words within most sentences are related in meaning and this facili- tates word recognition. This often involves semantic priming – a word is recognised or identified more rapidly if immediately preceded by a seman- tically related word. For example, we decide faster that “doctor” is a word when preceded by a semantically related priming word (e.g., “nurse”) than by a semantically unrelated word (e.g., “library”) (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971). Why does semantic priming occur? Perhaps the priming word “auto- matically” activates the stored representations of all words related to it due to massive previous learning. Alternatively, controlled processes may be involved, with a prime such as “nurse” leading readers to expect a seman- tically related word to follow. Neely (1977) showed both the above explanations are valid. The priming word was a category name (e.g., BIRD) followed by a letter string at 250, 400, or 700 ms. Participants decided whether the letter string (target) formed a word (lexical decision task). Participants were instructed the prime BIRD would mostly be followed by a type of bird, whereas the prime BODY would mostly be followed by part of a building. This gives us four conditions: (1) Expected, semantically related (e.g., BIRD–robin) (2) Expected, semantically unrelated (e.g., BODY–door) (3) Unexpected, semantically related (e.g., BODY–heart) (4) Unexpected, semantically unrelated (e.g., BIRD–arm) It was assumed “automatic” facilitatory processes would be activated if the target were semantically related to the prime but not if it were semantically unrelated. In contrast, controlled processes might be involved if the target were expected but not if it were unexpected. Neely (1977) obtained two priming or context effects (see Figure 9.16). First, there was a rapid, short-lived facilitatory effect based on semantic relatedness. Second, there was a slower but more long-lasting effect based on expectations, with expected target words showing facilitation and unex- pected ones showing an inhibitory effect. Andrews et al. (2017) reported additional support for “automatic” semantic priming. Skilled readers showed semantic priming even when the prime words were presented very briefly below the level of conscious awareness. However, there are issues concerning the interpretation of such findings. It is hard to assess whether there is any conscious awareness of stimuli (see Chapter 2) and the notion of “automaticity” is imprecise (see Chapter 5).

This is typically assessed by a word’s Cloze Score (the proportion of par- ticipants provided with the first few words of a sentence guessing it would be the next word). Readers consistently fixate for shorter periods of time on predictable words and are more likely to skip them (Staub, 2015). These effects occur in part because there is generally more semantic priming of predictable than unpredictable words. Word predictability also influences event- related potentials. This is especially true of the N400 component (a negative wave peaking at about 400 ms), which is larger when a word is semantically unexpected. Van Petten and Luka (2012) reviewed the rel- evant ERP research and found the N400 is smaller when a word’s predictability is high within the sentence context. They concluded, “the N400 . . . reliably indexes the benefits of semantic context” (p. 176). Early or late effects? How can we explain the effects of word pre- dictability? Perhaps anticipatory processing triggered by sentence context allows readers to process predictable words faster than unpre- dictable ones. Alternatively, it may simply be easier to integrate predict able words with the preceding context. According to this latter explanation, readers would use contextual information only after accessing the word’s meaning. Evidence suggesting readers can use anticipatory processing was reported by DeLong et al. (2005). Here is a sample sentence they used: The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly [a kite/an airplane] in the park. In this sentence, a kite is highly predictable whereas an airplane is not. There was a smaller N400 to the more predictable noun (e.g., kite) than the less predictable one (e.g., airplane). This finding was replicated in a large-scale study (Nieuwland et al., 2018). More strikingly, DeLong et al. (2005) reported a larger N400 to the article an (preceding airplane) than to a (preceding kite). These effects on processing prior to the presentation of a predictable or unpredictable noun Figure 9.16 The time course of inhibitory and facilitatory effects of priming as a function of whether or not the target word was related semantically to the prime, and of whether or not the target word belonged to the expected category.

However, this finding was not replicated (Nieuwland et al., 2018). Freunberger and Roehm (2017) measured the N400 to more predicta- ble and less predictable nouns presented in sentences as well as the N400 to the immediately preceding adverbs. There were two key findings. First, the N400 to the noun was smaller when it was more predictable in the sentence context. More importantly, adverbs strongly predicting the following noun had larger N400s than less predictive ones. This was because strongly pre- dictive adverbs led to increased activation of information relevant to the following noun before it was presented. Lexical prediction vs graded prediction Luke and Christianson (2016) distinguished between two types of predic- tion readers might use: (1) Lexical prediction: readers activate one specific word prior to its presentation. (2) Graded prediction: readers generate more partial and general predic- tions (e.g., the approximate meaning of the next word; whether the next word is a noun, verb, or some other part of speech). Lexical prediction involves “putting all your eggs in one basket” – if the actual word is not the one predicted, this would probably disrupt reading. Luke and Christianson (2016) analysed 55 text passages and discovered only 21% of content words (words having meaning) and 40% of function words (words clarifying grammatical structure) in these passages were the ones most com- monly guessed. Thus, most lexical predictions would be wrong. However, word predictability speeded up reading time across the entire range from very low to very high (consistent with the notion of graded prediction). Frisson et al. (2017) compared the reading time for an unpredictable (but plausible) word in a sentence when another word was (or was not) highly predictable at that point. Reading times were comparable. Thus, there was no prediction error cost when an incorrect word was far more predictable than the one actually presented. Nieuwland (2019) reviewed relevant neuroimaging research. He con- cluded that the evidence for lexical prediction in reading is “weak and inconsistent” (p. 367). Conclusions In sum, processing can be influenced at an early stage by word predicta- bility (perhaps prior to the presentation of the target word). The evidence strongly favours graded over lexical prediction. However, lexical prediction may sometimes be used when a sentence context very strongly predicts a given word (see DeLong et al., 2005, above). The most convincing evidence for graded prediction is that it has proved hard to identify any processing costs associated with prediction errors. What is involved in graded prediction?

Most beneficial effects of word predictability depend on predicting such general characteristics rather than predicting the word itself. READING ALOUD Read aloud the following words and non-words (pronounceable non-words are pseudowords but we will generally use the term non-words): CAT FOG COMB PINT MANTINESS FASS You probably regarded that as a simple task although it involves hidden complexities. For example, how do you know the b in comb is silent and that pint does not rhyme with hint? Presumably you have specific informa- tion stored in long-term memory about how to pronounce these words. However, that does not explain your ability to pronounce non-words such as mantiness and fass. Perhaps non-words are pronounced by analogy with real words (e.g., fass is pronounced to rhyme with mass). Alternatively, we may use rules governing the translation of letter strings into sounds to gen- erate pronunciations for non-words. The above description is incomplete. There are different reading disor- ders in brain-damaged patients depending on which parts of the language system are damaged. We turn now to two major theoretical approaches addressing these issues. First, there is the dual-route cascaded model (Coltheart et al., 2001). Second, there is the distributed connectionist approach or triangle model (Harm & Seidenberg, 2004; Plaut et al., 1996) extended to explain reading disorders (Patterson & Lambon Ralph, 1999). The above theoretical approaches are both connectionist models (see Glossary). Why is this? The processes involved in skilled reading are complex and interactive, and computational models can handle such com- plexity. Of particular importance, computational models make it easier to predict what follows from various theoretical assumptions (Norris, 2013). There are key differences between the above approaches. According to the dual-route approach, reading words and non-words involves different processes. These processes are relatively neat and tidy and some are rule- based. Alas, the dual-route approach has become less neat and tidy over time! According to the connectionist triangle approach, reading processes are used more flexibly than within the dual-route model. Reading involves interactive processes – all the relevant knowledge we possess about word sounds, word spellings and word meanings is used in parallel (at the same time) whether reading words or non-words. Of importance, reading aloud involves more involvement of the semantic system within this model. The most important difference between the two approaches concerns whether the processes involved in reading are specific to reading or whether they are more general. According to the triangle approach, “Reading is, in evolutionary terms, a recently developed skill . . . underpinned by the more mature primary systems of vision, phonology, and semantics” (Hoffman et al., 2015, p. E3719). Thus, reading involves relatively general systems. In contrast, the dual-route model focuses more on reading-specific processes.

After that, we directly compare the two models on controversial issues. Dual-route cascaded model Coltheart et al.’s (2001) dual-route cascaded model of reading (see Figure 9.17) accounts for reading aloud and silent reading. There are two main routes between printed words and speech, both starting with orthographic analysis (used for identifying and grouping letters in words). There is a non-lexical route using grapheme-phoneme rules to convert letters into sounds (see later discussion). The identification of these rules is somewhat arbitrary and open to question (Eysenck & Brysbaert, 2018). There is also a lexical route involving lexical or dictionary look-up. In Figure 9.17, the non-lexical route is Route 1 and the lexical route is divided into two sub-routes (Routes 2 and 3) depending on whether the semantic system (meanings of words) is used.

It is a cascaded model because it involves cascade processing with activation at one level being passed on to the next level prior to comple- tion of processing at the first level. Cascaded models differ from threshold models where activation at one level is only passed on to other levels after a given threshold of activation is reached. Earlier we discussed the role of phonological processing in visual word identification. Coltheart et al. (2001) argued for a weak phonological model where word identification generally does not depend on phonologi- cal processing. Coltheart et al. (2001) produced a detailed computational model to test their dual-route cascaded model. They started with 7,981 one-syllable words and used McClelland and Rumelhart’s (1981) interactive activation model (discussed earlier, pp. 437–439), to provide the orthographic com- ponent of their model. They predicted the pronunciation most activated by processing in the lexical and non-lexical routes would determine the naming response. Coltheart et al. (2001) found 99% of words and one-syllable words were read accurately. Route 1 (grapheme–phoneme conversion) Route 1 differs from the other routes in using grapheme–phoneme con- version, which involves converting spelling (graphemes) into sound (pho- nemes). A grapheme is a basic unit of written language whereas a phoneme is a basic unit of spoken language. Examples of graphemes are the i in pig and the igh in high. If a brain-damaged patient used only Route 1, what would we expect? Use of grapheme–phoneme conversion rules (converting each grapheme into the phoneme most closely associated with it) should permit accu- rate pronunciations of words with regular spelling–sound correspondence. However, these rules would not permit accurate pronunciation of irregular words not conforming to the conversion rules. For example, if the irregular word pint has grapheme–phoneme conversion rules applied to it, it would be pronounced to rhyme with hint. This is regularisation. Finally, grapheme– phoneme conversion rules can provide pronunciations of non-words. Surface dyslexics are apparently largely reliant on Route 1. Surface dyslexia involves special problems in reading irregular words. For example, KT, a surface dyslexic, read 81% of regular words and 100% of non-words accurately but only 41% of irregular words (McCarthy & Warrington, 1984). Over 70% of KT’s errors with irregular words involved regularisation. We might not expect to find cases of surface dyslexia in languages (e.g., Greek) lacking irregular words (i.e., all words follow grapheme–phoneme rules). However, Sotiropoulos and Hanley (2017) identified Greek individ- uals whose slow reading of Greek words suggested they might have surface dyslexia. When these individuals read English words and non-words, they showed the classic pattern associated with surface dyslexia: high accuracy KEY TERMS Cascade processing Later processing stages start before earlier processing stages have been completed when performing a task. Grapheme A small unit of written language corresponding to a phoneme (e.g., the ph in photo). Phonemes The smallest units of sound that distinguish one word from another and contribute to word meaning; the number and nature of phonemes varies across languages.

Route 2 (lexicon + semantic knowledge) and Route 3 (lexicon only) The basic idea behind Route 2 is that representations of thousands of famil- iar words are stored in an orthographic input lexicon. Visual presentation of a word produces activation within this lexicon. This is followed by obtain- ing its meaning from the semantic system, after which its sound pattern is generated by the phonological output lexicon. Route 3 also involves the orthographic input and phonological output lexicons but bypasses the semantic system. What would we expect to find in patients using Route 2 or 3 but not Route 1? Their intact orthographic input and phonological output lexicons means they could pronounce familiar words (regular or irregular). However, their inability to use grapheme-phoneme conversion rules means they should find it very hard to pronounce unfamiliar words and non-words. Phonological dyslexics fit this predicted pattern fairly well. Phono- logical dyslexia involves special problems with reading unfamiliar words and non-words. Caccappolo-van Vliet et al. (2004) studied two phonologi- cal dyslexics – their performance on reading familiar regular and irregular words exceeded 90% compared to under 60% with non-words. In a study discussed above, Sotiropoulos and Hanley (2017) identified two Greek individuals with phonological dyslexia: they had problems with non-words in Greek and English but not words. Deep dyslexia Deep dyslexia involves problems in reading unfamiliar words and an ina- bility to read non-words. However, its most striking symptom consists of semantic reading errors (e.g., ship read as boat). According to Coltheart et al. (2001), deep dyslexics use a completely different reading system based in the right hemisphere (it is in the left hemisphere for 90% of people). Accordingly, they concluded deep dyslexia cannot be explained by the dual-route cascaded model. Most evidence is inconsistent with this right- hemisphere hypothesis. Two routes? Findings from brain-damaged patients support the notion of two different routes (lexical vs non-lexical) in reading words. However, neuroimaging studies reveal individual differences. Jobard et al. (2011) found only indi- viduals with low working memory capacity (see Glossary) had activation in brain areas associated with grapheme–phoneme conversion. Fischer- Baum et al. (2018) found significant individual differences in the use of the non-lexical route by skilled readers. According to the dual-route model, the non-lexical route to reading involves grapheme–phoneme conversion. This requires serial left-to-right processing and so the time taken to start saying non-words should depend KEY TERMS Phonological dyslexia A condition in which familiar words can be read but there is impaired ability to read unfamiliar words and non-words.

In contrast, the lexical route involves parallel processing and so there should be minimal effects of length on the time taken to start saying words. Juphard et al. (2011) found the time to start saying three-syllable non- words was 26% longer than one-syllable ones, but for words this difference was only 11%. Syllabic length of non-words (but not words) influenced the duration of activity in brain areas associated with phonological pro- cessing. These findings suggest producing phonological representations of non-words is a slow, serial process whereas it is fast and parallel for words. Preliminary evaluation The dual-route cascaded model was the first systematic attempt to account for basic reading processes in brain-damaged and healthy individuals. The notion there are two routes in reading has been very influential and has attracted support from research on patients with various reading disorders (e.g., surface dyslexia; phonological dyslexia). The specific assumption there are separate lexical and non-lexical routes involving parallel and serial pro- cessing, respectively, has received behavioural and neuroimaging support from healthy individuals. What are the model’s limitations? First, it de-emphasises semantic processes in reading (discussed later, pp. 447–449). For example, Cattinelli et al. (2013) found in a meta-analytic review that reading was associated with activation in brain areas (e.g., parts of the temporal lobe; the anterior fusiform region) associated with semantic processing. Second, the model focuses on the reading of individual words. However, word reading in everyday life typically occurs within sentences. Third, the model does not exhibit learning and so cannot explain how children acquire grapheme–phoneme rules. However, Perry et al. (2007) developed a new connectionist dual-process model (the CDP+ model) based on the dual-route cascaded model. This model learns and also elim- inates other problems with the dual-route model. Fourth, the model assumes phonological processing of words typi- cally occurs relatively slowly and has little effect on word recognition and reading. In fact, however, phonological processing often occurs rapidly and automatically (Rastle & Brysbaert, 2006; discussed earlier, p. 436). Fifth, Adelman et al. (2014) found the model did not provide an ade- quate account of individual differences in reading. In addition, its assump- tion that readers have perfect knowledge of letter positions within words is incorrect. Sixth, it is desirable for computational models to have relatively few parameters (values free to change). The dual-route model has over 30 parameters, so it is unsurprising it fits the data well. Seventh, there are issues concerning the model’s applicability to non- English languages. For example, French orthography is unusual in that numerous letters are silent and so lack a phonological representation. However, the CDP+ model accounts for reading in French (Perry et al., 2014). Eighth, the model only accounts for the reading of one-syllable words. However, Mousikou et al.

Connectionist triangle model Within the dual-route model, it is assumed different routes are used to pro- nounce irregular words and non-words. According to the connectionist tri- angle approach, in contrast, All of the system’s knowledge of spelling-sound correspondences is brought to bear in pronouncing all types of letter strings [words and non-words]. Conflicts among possible alternative pronunciations of a letter string are resolved . . . by co-operative and competitive interac- tions based on how the letter string relates to all known words and their pronunciations. (Plaut et al., 1996, p. 58) Thus, reading depends on a highly interactive system based on “all hands to the pump”. The triangle model (which has been instantiated in distributed connec- tionist form) is shown in Figure 9.18. The three sides of the triangle are orthography (spelling), phonology (sound) and semantics (meaning). Of importance, the triangle model learns to produce the correct output (i.e., spoken word or non-word) from the input (i.e., written word or non-word) using back-propagation (see Glossary) by comparing actual responses against correct ones. If you compare Figure 9.18 with Figure 9.17, you can see semantics is more important in the triangle model. Note that this model (unlike the dual-route model) has no lexicons for orthographic or phonological words and lacks grapheme–phoneme rules. There are two routes from spelling to sound in the triangle model: (1) a direct pathway from orthography to phonology (O → P pathway); (2) an indirect pathway from orthography to phonology proceeding via seman- tics or word meanings (O → S → P pathway). The direct, non- semantic pathway is typically used when reading high-frequency and regular or consistent words, whereas the indirect, semantic pathway is mostly used when reading low-frequency and irregular or inconsistent words. Hoffman et al. (2015) found brain areas associated with orthographic, phonological and semantic processing were all activated during word reading (see Figure 9.18). These findings are as predicted by the triangle model. According to the triangle model, words and non-words vary in consistency – the extent to which their pronunciation agrees with those of similarly spelled words (neighbours). Harley (2010) gives the exam- ples of TAZE and TAVE. TAZE has consistent neighbours (gaze; laze; maze), whereas TAVE does not (have as well as gave, rave, and save). The prediction (discussed later, p. 451) is that consistent words and non- words should be said faster than inconsistent ones. In contrast, the dual- route model focuses on dividing words into regular ones (conforming Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["words.","However, Mousikou et al."]}

From Hoffman et al. (2015). to grapheme-phoneme rules) and irregular (not conforming to those rules). How does the triangle model account for the different dyslexias? It is assumed surface dyslexia mostly involves damage to the semantic system. Plaut et al. (1996) lesioned or damaged their connectionist model to reduce the contribution of semantics. Its performance matched the pattern with surface dyslexics: very good with all consistent words and non-words, worse on inconsistent high-frequency words, and worst on inconsistent low-frequency words. The model assumes that phonological dyslexia (involving problems in reading unfamiliar words and non-words) involves a general impairment of phonological processing. Relevant evidence is discussed later (see p. 450). Finally, there is deep dyslexia (involving problems in reading unfamiliar words and non-words plus semantic errors). Within the triangle model, deep dyslexia represents a serious form of phonological dyslexia with severely impaired phonological processing, leading to increased reliance on semantic processing. Findings Plaut et al. (1996) gave the model prolonged training with 2,998 words. Its performance resembled that of adult readers in various ways: (1) Inconsistent words took longer to name than consistent ones. (2) Rare words took longer to name than common ones. (3) The effects of consistency were much greater for rare words than common ones. (4) The network pronounced over 90% of non-words “correctly” (com- parable to adult readers). This is impressive given the network received no direct training on non-words. The triangle model assumes semantic processing (involving the O → S → P pathway) is generally involved when inconsistent/irregular words are read.

(2015) found greater activation within the anterior temporal lobe (associated with semantic processing) when participants read inconsistent/irregular words than when they read consistent/regular ones. Hoffman et al.’s (2015) findings do not show that semantic processing within the anterior temporal lobe plays a causal role. Ueno et al. (2018) obtained more direct evidence. They administered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) to the anterior temporal lobe to impair its functioning while participants read words. As predicted, TMS reduced reading accuracy when inconsistent/irregular words were read but not con- sistent/regular words. According to the triangle model, the O → P pathway should be used mostly when participants read regular/consistent words. As predicted, Hoffman et al. (2015) found functional connectivity between the brain areas involved in orthographic (ventral occipito-temporal cortex) and pho- nological processing (the precentral gyrus) was much greater with such words than inconsistent/irregular words. Preliminary evaluation The triangle model has several successes to its credit. First, there is much support for the two pathways assumed to be involved in reading aloud. Second, and most important, semantic processing plays a major role in reading especially with inconsistent or irregular words. Third, the triangle model focuses on how we learn to pronounce words, unlike the original dual-route cascaded model. Fourth, the model provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying the dyslexias (discussed below). What are the model’s limitations? First, the model “focused on the re cogni- tion of simple, often monosyllabic words” (Harley, 2013). Second, its emphasis is on explaining the reading of words presented in isolation, whereas words are typically read within a sentential context. Third, in its original version, as Plaut et al. (1996, p. 108) admitted, “The nature of processing within the semantic pathway has been characterised in only the coarsest way”. However, Harm and Seidenberg (2004) improved the model by implementing its semantic component to map orthography and phonology onto semantics. Controversial topics We turn now to controversial topics where the two models make different predictions. Note, however, that both models have evolved over time, and so some predictions have changed. 1 Surface dyslexia Surface dyslexics have problems reading irregular or inconsistent words but perform reasonably well with regular or consistent ones and with non- words. According to the dual-route model, surface dyslexics have damage to Routes 2 and 3 and so rely heavily on Route 1 (grapheme–phoneme conversion). In contrast, the triangle model claims the major problem in surface dyslexia is extensive damage to the semantic system.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\n450 Language Woollams et al. (2007) studied 51 patients with semantic demen- tia (see Glossary), a condition involving severe loss of knowledge about word meanings. Surface dyslexia was present in 48 of the patients, and the remaining 3 patients became surface dyslexics as their semantic knowledge deteriorated. Of crucial importance, there was a large negative correlation between the ability to read low-frequency irregular/inconsistent words and the extent of patients’ semantic knowledge. In sum, both models provide reasonable accounts of surface dyslexia. However, evidence that surface dyslexia is associated with severe prob- lems within the semantic system is easier to account for on the triangle model. 2 Phonological dyslexia Phonological dyslexia involves severe difficulties in reading unfamiliar words and non-words. According to the dual-route model, phonological dyslexics have an inability to use Route 1 (grapheme–phoneme conversion) – their problems are specific to reading. According to the triangle model, in con- trast, phonological dyslexics have a more general phonological deficit. The evidence is mixed. Support for the dual-route model was obtained by Caccappolo-van Vliet et al. (2004) (discussed earlier, p. 445). Their two phonological dyslexics showed essentially intact performance on various non-reading phonological tasks. However, Woollams and Patterson (2012) studied patients exhibiting symptoms of phonological dyslexia when reading aloud. The number of phonological errors these patients made in picture naming predicted their reading performance, indicating they had a relatively general phonological deficit. Henry et al. (2012, 2016) found patients with symptoms of phonolog- ical dyslexia had brain damage in areas associated with phonological pro- cessing. In addition, their performance when reading non-words depended on phonological processes also involved in speech production and speech perception. These findings support the triangle model. In sum, the available evidence indicates most (but not all) phonological dyslexics have fairly general phonological impairments. Thus, the findings are mostly more supportive of the triangle model. 3 Deep dyslexia Deep dyslexics make many semantic errors when reading aloud and have problems in reading unfamiliar words and non-words. As discussed earlier, Coltheart et al. (2001) (p. 445) argued that an account of deep dyslexia is outside the scope of the dual-route model because deep dyslexics predomi- nantly use the right (rather than left) hemisphere when reading. According to the triangle model, deep dyslexia and phonological dyslexia both involve severe impairments in phonological processing. The triangle model’s assumptions were supported by Jefferies et al. (2007). Deep dyslexics performed poorly on various phonologically based tasks (e.g., phoneme addition; phoneme subtraction). They concluded deep dyslexics have a general phonological impairment as do phonological dys- lexics. Crisp et al.

It is plausible the semantic errors made by deep dyslexics occur because their very severe problems with phonological processing force them to rely heavily on the semantic system. Ablinger and Radach (2016) studied a deep dyslexic, KJ, who relied excessively on semantic processing while reading aloud. Therapy based on increasing the involvement of phonological pro- cessing enhanced his ability to read words aloud. In sum, the triangle model provides a generally persuasive account of deep dyslexia. However, it is probably not applicable to all deep dyslexics (Harley, 2013). 4 Word regularity vs word consistency According to the dual-route model, regular words (those conforming to the grapheme–phoneme rules in Route 1) can often be named faster than irregu- lar words. According to the triangle model, what matters is consistency. The letter patterns in consistent words are pronounced in the same way in all words in which they appear and such words are predicted to be read faster than inconsistent words. Since irregular words tend to be inconsistent, we need careful experimentation to decide whether regularity or consistency is more important. Jared (2002) presented words belonging to the four following categories: (1) Regular consistent (e.g., bean) (2) Regular inconsistent (e.g., beak) (3) Irregular consistent (e.g., both) (4) Irregular inconsistent (e.g., bear) The findings were reasonably clear-cut: word naming times were affected much more by consistency than regularity (see Figure 9.19). Lee et al. (2005) studied Chinese speakers naming Chinese characters. Performance was influenced by character consistency and char- acter regularity with low-frequency characters but only by consistency with high-frequency characters. Thus, consistency and regularity both played a role. In sum, research provides some support for the dual-route and triangle models. How- ever, the findings provide stronger support for the triangle model. 5 Pronouncing non-words The dual-route model assumes non-word pronunciations depend on the application of grapheme–phoneme rules and so are inflex- ible. In contrast, the triangle model predicts Figure 9.19 Mean naming latencies for high-frequency (HF) and low- frequency (LF) words that were irregular (exception words: EXC) or regular and inconsistent (RI). Mean naming latencies of regular consistent words matched with each of these word types are also shown. The differences between consistent and inconsistent words were much greater than those between regular and irregular words (EXC compared to RI). From Jared (2002).

As predicted by the triangle model, Coltheart and Ulicheva (2018) discovered considerable evidence of flexibility in the pro- nunciations of non-words. The triangle model makes another prediction. Variability in pro- nunciation should be greater with inconsistent non-words than consis- tent ones because orthographically similar words provide more possible pronunciations for the former. Zevin and Seidenberg (2006) studied the pronunciations of consistent and inconsistent non-words. As predicted, the pronunciations of inconsistent words were more variable. This finding is not predicted by the dual-route model, according to which grapheme– phoneme rules should typically generate only one pronunciation for all non-words. Buetler et al. (2014) studied the influence of language context on pro- nunciation of non-words. German/French bilinguals read non-words pre- sented in a context of French or German words. Grapheme–phoneme rules were used more often in the German context. Why was this? The relation- ship between spelling and sound is much more consistent in German than French and so grapheme–phoneme conversion is easier to use in German. 6 General vs language-specific processes? More research supports the triangle model’s assumption that reading involves general processes than the dual-route’s assumption that it involves mostly reading-specific processes. Woollams et al. (2018) studied stroke patients suffering from aphasia (severe language problems). They assessed general phonological and semantic processing abilities in these patients using tasks not involving reading. They then related individual differences in these abilities to reading performance. What did Woollams et al. (2018) find? First, phonological process- ing ability strongly predicted reading performance with both words and non-words. Second, semantic processing ability strongly predicted reading performance with words but only weakly predicted reading performance with non-words. These findings are as predicted by the triangle model and strengthen the argument that poor reading performance often reflects impaired general cognitive processes. Much research on reading (and its disorders) has focused on the role of orthography (spelling; written form of words). However, poor readers may also have general problems with complex visual processing rather than more specific problems relating to correctly identifying letters and combi- nations of letters. Evidence that general visual processes may be involved was reported by Sigurdardottir et al. (2018). Individuals who were poor at reading also tended to have difficulties with face matching. In sum, the triangle approach suggests we should stop putting individ- uals with reading impairments into categories such as “phonological dys- lexia”, “surface dyslexia” and “deep dyslexia”. Instead, we should assess their general semantic, phonological and visual abilities so their underlying cognitive impairments can be interpreted within a three-dimensional space formed by those three abilities.

First, both models assume cor- rectly that reading words and non-words aloud is a complex achievement. Second, both models provide plausible accounts of reading applicable to dyslexics and those with intact reading skills. Third, both models have been implemented as computational models and so make precise predictions. With respect to the above six controversial issues, the triangle model has the edge (although this is less true of relatively recent theoretical devel- opments). Why is this so? It is assumed within the triangle model that reading is a skill that developed only recently in our evolutionary history. As a result, reading depends heavily on general processes not specific to reading. In contrast, the dual-route model’s emphasis is on reading- specific processes and structures (e.g., grapheme–phoneme rule system). This emphasis may be misplaced if evolutionary development has not provided us with the relevant neural architecture. READING: EYE-MOVEMENT RESEARCH Several theoretical approaches discussed earlier (e.g., interactive activation model; dual-route cascaded model; triangle model) focus on explaining the processing of isolated words. In contrast, research on eye movements during text reading has led to theories focusing on word reading within sen- tential contexts (Snell et al., 2018). Basic processes Eye movements are crucial to reading. Most text information we process relates to the word currently fixated. However, limited information from other words may also be processed. Our eyes move in rapid jerks (saccades). Saccades are ballistic (once initiated their direction cannot be changed). Regressions (the eyes moving backwards in the text) account for 10% of saccades. Saccades take 20–30 ms to complete and are separated by fixations lasting 200–250 ms. The length of each saccade is about 8 letters or spaces. Information is extracted from text only during each fixation. The amount of text from which useful information can be extracted on each fixation has been assessed using the “moving window” technique (Rayner et al., 2012). The text is mutilated except for an experimenter- defined area or window surrounding fixation point. When readers move their eyes, different parts of the text are mutilated to permit normal reading only within the window region. The perceptual span (effective field of view) extends 3 or 4 letters to left of fixation and up to 15 letters to the right in English and is affected by text difficulty. The size of the perceptual span means information from the parafovea (the area surrounding the fovea: see Glossary) is used during reading. Convincing evidence comes from the boundary technique. There is a preview word just to the right of fixation. When readers make a saccade to this word, it changes into the target word. The fixation time on the target KEY TERMS Saccades Rapid eye movements separated by eye fixations lasting about 250 ms.

Readers fixate 80% of content words (nouns, verbs and adjectives) but only 20% of function words (e.g., a, the, and, or). Words not fixated tend to be those easily processed (e.g., common, short or predictable). Finally, a word’s fixation time is longer if preceded by a rare word (the spillover effect). There are numerous theories of reading based on eye-movement data. We will focus on the most influential one: the E-Z Reader model. E-Z Reader model The original version of the E-Z Reader model was proposed by Reichle et al. (1998) and has been followed by several other versions (Sheridan & Reichle, 2016). The model assumes the mind and eyes are tightly coupled, and so patterns of eye movements provide potentially rich data concerning readers’ processing strategies. The most obvious model would assume we fixate a word until it is pro- cessed adequately, after which we immediately fixate the next word. Alas, there are two major problems with this model. First, it takes 85–200 ms to execute an eye-movement programme and so readers would waste time waiting for their eyes to move to the next word. Second, readers sometimes skip words. According to the model, readers know nothing about the next word until it is fixated. How, then, could they decide which words to skip? The E-Z Reader model provides elegant solutions to the above prob- lems. A crucial assumption is that the next eye movement is programmed after only partial processing of the current word (word n). This greatly reduces the time between completing processing of word n and an eye movement to the next word (word n+1). There is typically less spare time available with rare words than common ones – this accounts for the spill- over effect. If the processing of word n+1 is completed rapidly enough, it is skipped. According to the model, readers can attend to two words (words n and n+1) during a single fixation. However, it is a serial processing model – at any given moment, only one word is processed. Here are its main assump- tions (see Figure 9.20): (1) Readers check the familiarity of the word currently fixated (word n). (2) Completion of the familiarity check (the first stage of lexical access) is the signal to initiate an eye-movement programme. (3) Readers then engage in the second stage of lexical access, which involves accessing word n’s semantic and phonological forms. (4) Familiarity checking and lexical access are completed faster for easily processed words (e.g., common; short; predictable). (5) Completion of lexical access to word n signals a shift of covert (inter- nal) attention to word n+1. Several findings support the model (Reingold et al., 2012). First, common words are fixated for less time than rare ones. Second, a word following a rare word is fixated longer than one following a common word (the KEY TERM Spillover effect Any given word is fixated longer during reading when preceded by a rare word rather than a common one.

Third, word n+1 is skipped when its lexical access has been completed during fixation on word n. This typically occurs when word n is common, short or predictable. The E-Z Reader model (which emphasises serial processing) can be contrasted with parallel processing models such as the SWIFT model (Saccade-Generation With Inhibition by Foveal Targets) model (e.g., Engbert et al., 2005; Schad & Engbert, 2012). This model assumes the durations of eye fixations in reading are often influenced by parallel pro- cessing of the previous and next words as well as the current one. Attentional processes are of central importance to both models. The E-Z Reader model assumes an attentional spotlight moves from one word to the next. Within the SWIFT model, in contrast, attention is more like a zoom lens because its scope can change (see Chapter 5). Attention is widely distributed when foveal processing is easy but more narrowly focused when it is hard. The two models both account for most findings. However, they differ with respect to lexical parafoveal-on-foveal effects. This sounds complicated but simply means lexical properties of the next word (e.g., its frequency and/ or predictability) influence the fixation duration on the current word. Such effects should not occur according to the serial processing E-Z Reader model, but they can occur according to the parallel processing SWIFT model. Findings According to the E-Z Reader model, there are two stages of lexical pro- cessing for words: (1) checking word familiarity; (2) lexical access (access- ing semantic and phonological information about the word). Sheridan and Reingold (2013) argued that presenting words faintly disrupts stage (1) but not stage (2). In contrast, case alternation (e.g., tAbLe) disrupts only stage (2). Their findings were as predicted, thus supporting the notion that lexical processing occurs in two stages.

As a result, fixation time on word n+1 is reduced when parafoveal process- ing is possible. Vasilev and Angele (2017) found in a meta-analysis that parafoveal review reduced gaze duration on word n+1 by an average of 40 ms. What information is extracted from word n+1 during parafoveal review? Schotter et al. (2012) found that orthographic (word spelling), pho- nological (word sound) and morphological (word structure) information can all be processed parafoveally. As mentioned earlier, readers sometimes skip word n+1 (i.e., do not fixate it) when reading. This suggests a complete identification of word n+1 can occur during parafoveal review. Consistent with these findings, Angele et al. (2016) found evidence for two stages of parafoveal processing: (1) early orthography-based processing; and (2) late attentionally dependent lexical access. Most research has focused only on the English language. Rayner et al. (2007) studied eye movements in Chinese individuals reading Chinese text. Chinese differs from English in that it is written without spaces between characters. Nevertheless, the pattern of eye movements resembled that found in readers of English. We turn now to lexical parafoveal-on-foveal effects where lexical properties (e.g., frequency) of the next word influence the processing of the current word. Remember the SWIFT model predicts such effects whereas the E-Z Reader model does not. There would be evidence for parafoveal-on-foveal effects if gaze duration on word n were greater when word n+1 was a low-frequency rather than high-frequency word. Brothers et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analytic review of research where the frequency of word n+1 was manipulated. There was no evidence for parafoveal-on-foveal effects across several languages (e.g., English; Finnish; Spanish; Chinese). Brothers et al. reported a similar absence of lexical parafoveal-on-foveal effects in further meta-analyses focusing on other features of word n+1 related to lexical access (i.e., semantic plau- sibility; lexical predictability). Degno et al. (2019) pointed out that most previous research had used very artificial reading conditions. They used a more natural reading task, but also failed to find any evidence of lexical parafoveal-on-foveal effects. Evaluation The E-Z Reader model is very successful in several ways. First, there is ample justification for its emphasis on eye-movement patterns, because “the control of eye movements is part and parcel of the dynamics of informa- tion processing within the task of reading itself” (Radach & Kennedy, 2013, p. 429). Second, it identifies several factors (e.g., word frequency; word pre- dictability) determining eye fixations in reading. Third, there is support for the assumption lexical processing occurs in two separate stages (i.e., famili- arity checking and lexical access). Fourth, parafoveal preview of the next word typically facilitates its subsequent processing when fixated. Fifth, the assumption there are close Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["word (word n) is influenced by lexical properties of the next word (word n+1).","Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

Sixth, the absence of lexical parafoveal-on-fovea effects supports serial models (e.g., E-Z Reader) over parallel models (e.g., SWIFT). What are the model’s limitations? (1) The E-Z Reader and SWIFT models both explain where and when the eyes move during reading. Such approaches have proceeded inde- pendently of approaches (e.g., McClelland & Rumelhart’s, 1981, inter- active activation model) designed to identify the processes involved in word recognition. However, Snell et al. (2018) produced a com- putational model of reading (OB1-reader) integrating insights from eye-movement and word-recognition models. (2) The role of higher-level processes is de-emphasised. For example, the processes involved in inference drawing, integration of information within sentences, and the use of schematic and other knowledge in text comprehension are outside the model’s scope (see Chapter 10). (3) We do not know in detail how readers perform the familiarity check. Reingold et al. (2015) argued it depends on the fluency of orthographic processing (processing the pattern of letters) but the evidence is inconclusive. (4) There may be more parallel processing during reading than acknow- ledged by the E-Z model. For example, Snell et al.’s (2018) OB1-reader model (which assumes extensive parallel processing) successfully accounts for many aspects of reading behaviour. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Speech (and music) perception: introduction. Speech and music perception both involve categorical perception. However, there are typically substantial differences in the brain areas activated during speech and music perception. In addition, some patients have selective impairment of speech or music perception. Speech perception involves various stages starting with selection of speech from the acoustic background and including word recognition and utterance interpretation. Speech perception is often more variable than implied by the notion of sequential stages. • Listening to speech. Among the problems faced by listeners are the speed of spoken language, the segmentation problem, co-articulation, individual differences in speech patterns, and degraded speech. Listeners prefer to use lexical (e.g., syntax) information to achieve word segmentation but can also use co-articulation, allophony and syllable stress. Listeners often cope with variations between speakers by forming a speaker model. The McGurk effect shows listeners often make use of visual information (i.e., lip-reading) during speech perception.

Context influences speech perception in several ways (e.g., phonemic restoration effect; Ganong effect) There is much controversy concerning how context influences speech perception. The main divide is between those arguing such effects occur late in processing (autonomous position) and those arguing they can also occur early in processing (interactionist position). The interactionist position has received much support recently. However, it is more applicable when speech is degraded than when it is clear and unambiguous. • Theories of speech perception. Spoken word recognition is often influenced by orthography (word spellings). According to the motor theory, motor processes can facilitate speech perception. In support, brain areas involved in speech production are typically involved in speech perception. Impaired speech perception following damage to speech-production systems also supports the theory. However, many brain areas are involved in speech perception but not speech production. The TRACE model assumes bottom-up and top-down processes interact flexibly in spoken word recognition. The model accounts for several phenomena (e.g., word superiority effect, the Ganong effect, categorical perception and the phonemic restoration effect). However, it has a narrow focus on word recognition, it exaggerates the importance of top-down processes and it de-emphasises the role of conceptual meaning. The cohort model assumes spoken word recognition involves rejecting competitors in a sequential process. It also assumes that context effects occur during the integration stage following word identification. However, context sometimes influences word processing prior to the integration stage. The model also de-emphasises the role of word meanings in spoken word recognition. There is support for the more recent assumption that there is continuous integration of information from the speech input and context. • Cognitive neuropsychology. Brain-damaged patients exhibit various patterns of impairment in speech perception. Some of these patterns can be explained by assuming the existence of three routes between sound and speech. Support has been obtained by studying patients with pure word deafness, word meaning deafness and transcranial sensory aphasia. The three- route approach provides a sketch map rather than a detailed theoretical account. • Reading: introduction. It is harder to read English than most other languages because the relationship between spelling and sound is very inconsistent. Lexical decision, naming and priming tasks are used to assess word identification. Studies of masked phonological priming suggest that visual word recognition typically depends on Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["n make use of visual information (i.e., lip-reading) during speech perception.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

The finding that word recognition depends on the number of phonologically similar words also indicates the importance of phonological processing. • Word recognition. According to the interactive activation model, bottom-up and top-down processes interact during word recognition. The model accounts for the word-superiority effect and the effects of orthographic neighbours on word recognition but not for the roles of meaning and sound. Semantic priming can facilitate word recognition “automatically” or in a more controlled fashion. More generally, semantic priming reduces the amount of visual information required for word recognition. Words predictable within the sentence context are processed faster than those less predictable. Readers’ predictions are typically general or graded rather than specific, which minimises prediction-error costs. • Reading aloud. According to the dual-route model, reading involves lexical and non-lexical routes (the latter involving grapheme–phoneme conversion rules). Surface dyslexics rely mainly on the non-lexical route whereas phonological dyslexics use mostly the lexical route. The triangle model consists of orthographic, phonological and semantic systems. The reading of regular or consistent words involves a pathway from orthography to phonology, whereas the reading of irregular/inconsistent words involves a pathway from orthography to phonology via semantics. Surface dyslexia is attributed to damage within the semantic system, whereas phonological dyslexia stems from a general phonological impairment. The triangle model emphasises general processes not specific to reading whereas the dual-route model focuses on reading-specific processes. The triangle model provides a more adequate account (e.g., the importance it attaches to semantic processing is well supported). • Reading: eye-movement research. According to the E-Z Reader model, the completion of familiarity checking of the current word is the signal to initiate an eye-movement programme, and the completion of lexical access is the signal to shift attention covertly to the next word. It is a serial processing model in contrast to parallel processing models (e.g., SWIFT). The absence of lexical parafoveal-on-foveal effects (lexical effects of the next word on processing of the current word) supports serial models. The E-Z Reader model is limited because it de-emphasises the processes involved in word recognition and higher-level reading processes (e.g., use of knowledge in text comprehension).

In this chapter, we discuss how phrases, sentences and entire texts (e.g., stories) are processed and understood during reading and listen- ing. Sentence comprehension is complex. Neural activity within the brain increases steadily during the reading of a sentence but not with non-word lists or meaningless sentences (Fedorenko et al., 2016). This progressive increase “reflects the increasing complexity of the evolving representation of the meaning of the sentence” (Fedorenko et al., 2016, p. E6262). The previous chapter dealt mainly with aspects of language processing differing between reading and listening to speech. In contrast, higher-level comprehension processes are similar whether a story is listened to or read. The research focus has been on comprehension processes in reading rather than listening and so our emphasis will be on reading. However, what is true of reading is mostly also true of comprehending speech. What is the structure of this chapter? We start by considering com- prehension at the sentence level and finish by focusing on comprehension processes with larger language units (e.g., complete texts). More detail is given below. There are two main levels of analysis in sentence comprehension. First, there is an analysis of the syntactical structure of each sentence. Syntax involves a study of the rules of word order. Grammar is somewhat broader in meaning. It focuses on the structure of a language (especially syntax and inflections). Inflections involve modifying nouns or verbs to indicate grammatical changes (e.g., adding -ed to a verb to indicate the past tense). Second, there is an analysis of sentence meaning. The intended meaning of a sentence often differs from its literal meaning as in irony, sarcasm or metaphor. For example, someone may say “Don’t overdo it!” when talking to a notoriously lazy colleague. The study of intended meaning is prag- matics. The context in which a sentence is spoken can also influence its intended meaning. Issues concerning pragmatics are discussed immediately after the section on parsing. In the third section, we consider processes involved when individuals are presented with a text or speech consisting of several or numerous Chapter 10 KEY TERMS Syntax The set of rules concerning word order to create well-formed sentences.

The major theoretical issue is the following: what determines which inferences are (or are not) drawn during language comprehension? In the fourth section, we consider processing involving larger units of language. When we read a text, we typically try to integrate the infor- mation within it. Such integration often involves drawing inferences, identifying the main themes in the text, and so on. These integrative pro- cesses (and theories put forward to explain them) are discussed in this section. PARSING: OVERVIEW This section is devoted to parsing (analysis of the syntactical or gram- matical structure of sentences) plus the processes readers and listeners use to comprehend sentences. Parsing allows readers and listeners “to say who did what to whom (or how, when, and where)” (Traxler, 2014, p. 605). Most parsing research has focused only on the English language. Does this matter? The short answer is “Yes”. Information about grammar can be provided by word order or by inflection (see Glossary). Many languages (e.g., Arabic; German; French) are more inflectional than English and thus have a richer morphology (analysis of the morphemes or basic units of meaning within words). Such languages permit greater flexibility of word order than English. As a consequence, it has proved easier to develop computational models of parsing for English than most other languages (Tsarfaty et al., 2013). Syntax and grammar We can produce an infinite number of grammatically correct sentences in any language (this is known as productivity). Linguists (e.g., Chomsky, 1957) have produced rules explaining the productivity and regularity of language. A set of rules focusing on syntax or word order and inflections forms a grammar. Ideally, we can use a grammar to decide whether any given sentence is permissible or unacceptable. Numerous sentences are ambiguous. Some are globally ambiguous meaning the entire sentence has two interpretations (e.g., “Kids make nutri- tious snacks”). Others are locally ambiguous – various interpretations are possible during parsing. Why are so many sentences ambiguous? Language users apply a least effort principle because it would be very demanding for speakers and writers to produce only unambiguous sentences (Solé & Seoane, 2015). Piantadosi et al. (2012) argued listeners and readers can usually deal with some ambiguity. The context typically provides useful information about sentence meaning. In addition, it would be inefficient (and extremely boring for listeners and readers!) if spoken or written language duplicated that information. Why does much research on parsing use ambiguous sentences? Parsing generally occurs very rapidly, which makes it hard to study the processes KEY TERMS Parsing Analysing the syntactical or grammatical structure of sentences.

Assessing the problems encountered by listeners and readers struggling with ambiguous sentences is revealing about parsing processes. Prosodic cues One way that listeners work out the syntactic or grammatical structure of spoken languages is by using prosodic cues (e.g., stress; intonation; rhythm; word duration). When each syllable is spoken in a monotone lacking prosodic cues, listeners struggle to understand the speaker (Duffy & Pisoni, 1992). The use of prosodic cues by speakers and writers is discussed in Chapter 11. Suppose a spoken sentence contains a prosodic cue (pause) that occurs misleadingly at a place conflicting with its syntactic structure. Pauker et al. (2011) found this made the sentence much harder to understand, thus showing the impact of prosodic cues (this study is discussed in more detail later, see p. 466). Prosodic cues are most valuable with ambiguous spoken sentences. Consider the ambiguous sentence, “The old men and women sat on the bench”. If the women are not old, the spoken duration of men will be relatively long and the stressed syllable in women will have a steep rise in pitch contour. Listeners often use prosodic cues very rapidly to facilitate the under- standing of ambiguous sentences. Holzgrefe et al. (2013) presented word strings such as Mona oder Lena und Lola [Mona or Lena and Lola] auditor- ily with a pause and other prosodic cues occurring after the word Mona (early pause) or Lena (late pause). When the pause came after the word Lena to indicate it was Mona or Lena as well as Lola, listeners immedi- ately integrated the prosodic information into their parsing. In a similar study, Petrone et al. (2017) found parsing was more influenced by pauses at phrase boundaries than other prosodic cues (e.g., phrase-final lengthen- ing: longer sound at the end of a phrase). As Drury et al. (2016, p. 1) pointed out, “Unlike speech, written lan- guage does not provide the same wealth of prosodic information”. How do readers cope? According to Fodor’s (1998) implicit prosody hypothesis, readers activate prosodic patterns during silent reading using their “inner voice”. Support for Fodor’s (1998) hypothesis was reported by Steinhauer and Friederici (2001), who asked participants to listen to sentences containing pauses and read sentences containing commas. Event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) were similar in both cases suggesting participants used their “inner voice” while reading. In a similar reading study, Drury et al. (2016) manipulated the plausi- bility of sentences via the presence or absence of commas (e.g., John, said Mary, was the nicest boy at the party vs John said Mary was the nicest boy at the party). The impact of this manipulation on ERPs closely resembled the impact of manipulating pauses with similar spoken sentences in previ- ous research. These findings are also consistent with the implicit prosody hypothesis. Direct evidence implicit prosody benefits reading was reported by Calet et al. (2017). Prosody training (reading with an emphasis on sensitivity to prosody) increased reading fluency and comprehension in primary-school children.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\n464 Language The effects of prosody are more complex than indicated so far in three ways. First, we must consider the overall pattern of prosodic phrasing within a sentence rather than simply what happens at one particular point. Consider the following ambiguous sentence: I met the daughter (#1) of the colonel (#2) who was on the balcony. Frazier et al. (2006) found the interpretation of this sentence depended on the relationship between the phrase boundaries at #1 and #2. Listeners were much more likely to assume the colonel was on the balcony when the first boundary was greater than the second one than when the first boundary was smaller than the second. Second, there is much evidence that individual speakers differ con- siderably in their production of prosody (Cole, 2015). This variability makes it harder for listeners to understand what any given speaker is saying. Third, Fodor (1998) assumed implicit prosody in reading (based on inner speech) is very similar to explicit or spoken prosody. Research find- ings supporting this assumption were discussed earlier. However, it is not always supported. Jun (2010) found systematic differences between prosody generated in silent reading and prosody generated in reading aloud when the text had not been skimmed in advance. Thus, the implicit prosody hypothesis may have limited applicability. THEORETICAL APPROACHES: PARSING AND PREDICTION An important theoretical issue is to work out when different kinds of infor- mation are used during sentence comprehension. Much research on parsing concerns the relationship between syntactic and semantic analysis. There are at least four major possibilities: (1) Syntactic analysis generally precedes (and influences) semantic analysis. (2) Semantic analysis usually occurs prior to syntactic analysis. (3) Syntactic and semantic analysis occur at the same time. (4) Syntax and semantics are very closely associated and have a hand-in- glove relationship (Altmann, personal communication). At the risk of oversimplification, early theories of parsing tended to favour possibility (1) above, whereas later ones focus more on the remaining possi- bilities (Traxler, 2014). There are more models of parsing than you can shake a stick at. However, many belong to two categories: (1) two-stage, serial processing theories; (2) one-stage, parallel processing models. The garden-path model (Frazier & Rayner, 1982) has been the most influential one in the first cate- gory. Its key assumption is that the initial attempt to parse a sentence uses only syntactic information. MacDonald et al.’s (1994) constraint-based model has been the most influential example of a one-stage, parallel processing model.

We initially consider the above two models. After that, we turn to alternative models. One of these is the unrestricted race model, which com- bines aspects of the garden-path and constraint-based models. We will discover many apparent inconsistencies in research findings on parsing. Why is that? Most people are very sensitive to language subtleties. As a result, sentence parsing often varies because of relatively minor differ- ences in the sentences presented. It has often been assumed in linguistics and cognitive psychology that nearly all adult native speakers have fully mastered the grammar of their language (Chomsky, 1965), and this assumption is implicit in many theo- ries and much research. It follows from the above assumption that inaccurate sentence parsing reflects deficient processing rather than deficient grammatical knowledge and competence. In fact, non-verbal IQ correlates +.46 with grammatical knowledge, meaning that many individuals with low non-verbal IQ have severely deficient grammatical knowledge (Dąbrowska, 2018). However, researchers rarely consider deficient grammatical knowledge as a potential explanation for poor parsing performance. Garden-path model Frazier and Rayner’s (1982) garden-path model was an early theory of parsing. It is so-called because readers (and listeners) can be misled or “led up the garden path” by ambiguous sentences. A famous (or notorious!) example of such a sentence is “The horse raced past the barn fell”. It is notorious because it is very hard to understand (partly because such sentences occur exceptionally rarely in naturally produced sentences). The model incorporates the following assumptions: ● Only one syntactical structure is initially considered for any sentence. ● Meaning is not involved in the selection of the initial syntactical structure. ● Two general principles influence the initial syntactical structure: minimal attachment and late closure. ● According to the principle of minimal attachment, the structure pro- ducing the fewest nodes (major parts of a sentence such as noun phrase and verb phrase) is preferred. ● The principle of late closure is that new words encountered in a sen- tence are attached to the current phrase or clause if grammatically permissible. ● Conflict between the above two principles is resolved in favour of the minimal attachment principle. ● If the initial syntactic structure is incompatible with additional information (e.g., semantic), it is revised during a second processing stage.

(2016, p. 8): they arise “out of the pressure to interpret a sentence as quickly as possible . . . relating new words to phrases currently in active memory is faster than building new or more complex structures”. Findings The relevance of the principle of minimal attachment was shown by Frazier and Rayner (1982). Consider the following sentences: (1) The girl knew the answer by heart. (2) The girl knew the answer was wrong. The minimal attachment principle produces a grammatical structure in which the answer is treated as the direct object of the verb “knew”. This is appropriate only for the first sentence. As predicted, Frazier and Rayner found eye fixations were longer with the second sentence. Frazier and Rayner (1982) also showed the importance of the principle of late closure. Consider the following sentences: (1) Since Jay always jogs a mile it seems like a short distance to him. (2) Since Jay always jogs a mile seems like a short distance to him. Use of the principle of late closure leads a mile to be included in the first clause as the object of jogs. This is appropriate only for the first sentence. Readers had very long fixations on the word seems in the second sen- tence when it became clear the principle of late closure was not applicable. However, the second sentence is much easier to read with a comma (a pro- sodic cue) after jogs (Rayner et al., 2012). According to the garden-path model, the syntactic structure of sen- tences can often be worked out in the almost complete absence of seman- tic information. Supporting evidence comes from patients with semantic dementia (a condition involving loss of word meanings; see Glossary and Chapter 7). Such patients sometimes show essentially intact performance on tasks involving grammaticality judgements (e.g., Garrard et al., 2004). In a study mentioned earlier, Pauker et al. (2011) presented listeners with sentences such as the following including prosodic cues (pauses indi- cated by #): (1) When a bear is approaching the people # the dogs come running. (2) When a bear is approaching # the people # the dogs came running. According to the model, listeners should apply the principle of late closure and so find it easy to identify the correct syntactical structure. This was found with sentences such as (1) where the pause’s location coincided with the syntactic structure. In contrast, performance was very poor with sen- tences such as (2) because of the misleading pause (e.g. between approach- ing and people). Thus, listeners’ adherence to the principle of late closure can be greatly disrupted by misleading prosodic cues. Drury et al.

According to the garden-path model, the initial parsing of an ambig- uous sentence should be uninfluenced by visual context providing infor- mation relevant to the sentence’s interpretation. Coco and Keller (2015) presented listeners with ambiguous sentences and with relevant visual context. Ambiguity resolution within the sentence depended mostly on lin- guistic information, which is broadly consistent with the model. However, visual context had more influence on sentence processing than expected by the model. Finally, when readers initially construct an incorrect syntactic struc- ture for a garden-path sentence, the model predicts they should revise it in the light of additional information and so typically produce the correct syntactic structure. Findings reported by Qian et al. (2018) are inconsistent with this prediction. Readers were presented with garden-path sentences such as the following: While the man hunted, the deer that was brown and graceful ran into the woods. This was followed by the question, Did the man hunt the deer? Readers pro- duced numerous incorrect “Yes” responses with such sentences (approxi- mately 50% errors). Thus, they often failed to work out the correct syntactic structure. Evaluation The model provides a simple and coherent account of parsing. The prin- ciples of minimal attachment and late closure often influence the selec- tion of an initial syntactic structure for sentences. The model is plausible in that these two principles reduce processing demands on the reader or listener. What are the model’s limitations? First, it assumes parsers who dis- cover that their initial preferred syntactic structure is incorrect go back to square one and form an alternative structure. As Kuperberg and Jaeger (2016) pointed out, this “all-or-nothing” assumption is simply incorrect. More generally, the model mistakenly assumes initial attempts at parsing are inflexible (see below, pp. 468–470). Second, opposed to the model’s assumptions, den Ouden et al. (2016) found syntactic processing typically does not occur in the absence of other forms of processing. This conclusion was based on patterns of brain acti- vation during the processing of garden-path sentences. Behavioural evi- dence discussed shortly indicates that several factors (including misleading prosody and prior context) prevent readers and listeners from adhering to the principles of minimal attachment and late closure. Third, the model assumes readers will ultimately generate a correct syntactic structure even for complex sentences. However, this is often not the case when sentences are complex and hard to comprehend (e.g., Qian et al., 2018).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\n468 Language Fourth, the model is hard to test. For example, evidence that non- syntactic information is used early in sentence processing seems inconsist- ent with the model. However, the second stage of parsing (following the first, syntactic stage) may simply start very rapidly. Fifth, the model is more applicable to English than other languages. For example, there is a preference for early (rather than late) closure in several languages (e.g., Spanish; Russian; French) (Harley, 2013). Mandarin differs from most European languages in having fewer reliable cues to syn- tactic structure and a more flexible word order (Huang et al., 2016). Thus, principles such as those of minimal attachment and late closure are not directly relevant to Mandarin. Constraint-based model According to MacDonald et al.’s (1994) constraint-based model, initial sentence interpretation depends on multiple information sources (e.g., syn- tactic; semantic; general world knowledge) called constraints. These con- straints limit (or constrain) the number of possible interpretations. The model is based on a connectionist architecture (see Chapter 1) which exhibits learning through experience. It is assumed all relevant sources of information are immediately available to the parser. Competing analyses of the current sentence are activated at the same time. The syn- tactic structure receiving most support from the various constraints is more activated than other syntactic structures. Confusion occurs if the correct syntactic structure is less activated than one or more incorrect structures. The processing system uses four language characteristics to resolve sen- tence ambiguities: (1) Grammatical knowledge constrains possible sentence interpretations. (2) The various forms of information associated with any given word are typically not independent of each other. (3) A word may be less ambiguous in some ways than in others (e.g., ambiguous tense but not grammatical category). (4) The various interpretations permissible according to grammatical rules generally differ considerably in frequency and probability based on past experience. The syntactic interpretation most consistent with such experience is typically selected. MacDonald (2013) developed her constraint-based model. She started by assuming speakers use various strategies to reduce processing demands on them (see also Chapter 11). Here is one strategy: the speaker can start with common words and syntactically simple phrases while planning the rest of the utterance. Another strategy is for the speaker to re-use sentence plans – that is, to favour practised and easy sentence plans. MacDonald’s (2013) key assumption is that listeners’ comprehension processes are sensitive to these strategies, which increases their ability to predict the speaker’s next utterance. In sum, “Rarer patterns [produced by speakers] are more difficult to comprehend than frequent patterns” (Momma & Phillips, 2018, p. 236).

Findings According to the constraint-based model, several kinds of non-syntactic information are used very early in sentence processing. In contrast, this occurs only after an initial stage of syntactic processing within the garden- path model. Much research is more consistent with the constraint-based model. For example, researchers (e.g., Hagoort et al., 2004) using event- related potentials have found sentence processing is influenced very rapidly by semantic factors (discussed further later, pp. 475–476). The constraint-based model assumes sentence processing is paral- lel whereas the garden-path model assumes it is serial. Cai et al. (2012) compared the models’ predictions using ambiguous sentences such as the following: Because it was John that Ralph threatened the neighbour recorded their conversation. This sentence is initially ambiguous because it is unclear whether the neigh- bour is the subject of the main clause (recorded their conversation: subject analysis) or the object of the preceding verb (threatened: object analysis). Readers interpreted the sentence in line with the subject analysis. However, the object analysis disrupted sentence processing even though it was not adopted. This finding suggests there was parallel processing of the two analyses as predicted by the constraint-based model. According to the model, verbs are an important constraint that often strongly influence initial attempts at parsing. The focus has been especially on verb bias – some verbs (e.g., read ) are associated with two different syntactic structures (but more frequently with one). Consider the following two sentences: (1) The professor read the newspaper had been destroyed. (2) The professor read the newspaper during his break. The second sentence is easier to understand because the verb read is gener- ally followed by a direct object, as in (2). However, it can also be followed by an embedded clause, as in (1). According to the constraint-based model, readers should find it easier to resolve ambiguities (and identify the correct syntactic structure) when the sentence structure is consistent with the verb bias. According to the garden-path model, in contrast, verb bias should have no initial effect. Wilson and Garnsey (2009) studied verb bias in ambiguous sentences. As predicted by the constraint-based model, it took longer to resolve the ambiguity when the sentence structure was inconsistent with the verb bias. Thus, readers’ previous experience with verbs immediately influenced sen- tence processing. Fine et al. (2013) asked participants to read sentences such as the following: KEY TERM Verb bias An imbalance in the frequency with which a verb is associated with different syntactic structures.

(2) The experienced soldiers warned about the dangers conducted the midnight raid. Both sentences are temporarily ambiguous. However, verbs such as warned are far more likely to occur as a main verb, as in sentence (1), than as the verb in a relative clause, as in sentence (2). Accordingly, readers find it much easier to process sentences such as (1) than those such as (2). Fine et al. (2013) used a condition in which 50% of sentences resem- bled sentence (1) and 50% resembled sentence (2). Readers rapidly adapted their syntactic expectations so they increasingly read sentences such as (2) with relative ease. The take-home message is that the initial syntactic struc- ture considered by readers is flexible and influenced by recent past experi- ence. This flexibility is entirely consistent with the constraint-based model but not the garden-path model. Evaluation What are the constraint-based model’s strengths? First, it seems efficient that readers and listeners should use all relevant information from the outset when working out a sentence’s syntactic structure. As we have seen, non-syntactic factors (e.g., word meaning; verb bias) are often used very rapidly. Second, the model predicts much flexibility in parsing because it is influenced by our past linguistic experience. There is strong support for this prediction (e.g., Fine et al., 2013). Brysbaert and Mitchell (1996) found substantial individual differences among Dutch readers in their parsing decisions, providing further evidence of flexibility. What are the model’s limitations? First, its predictions are often impre- cise. As Rayner et al. (2012, p. 229) pointed out, “It is difficult . . . to falsify the general claim that parsing is interactive and constraint-based . . . it does not by itself make any clear predictions about which things actually matter, or how and when they have their influence.” Second, much experimental support for the model consists of findings showing that non-syntactic factors influence early sentence processing. Such findings are clearly consistent with the model. However, some can be accounted for by the garden-path model by assuming the second, non- syntactic, stage of parsing starts very rapidly. Unrestricted race model Van Gompel et al. (2000) proposed the unrestricted race model combining aspects of the garden-path and constraint-based models. Here are its main assumptions: (1) All information sources (semantic + syntactic) are used to identify a syntactic structure (consistent with the constraint-based model). (2) All other syntactic structures are ignored unless the favoured syntac- tic structure is disconfirmed by subsequent information.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nLanguage comprehension 471 (3) If the initial syntactic structure is discarded, there is an extensive re-analysis to form a new one. This resembles the garden-path model in that parsing often involves two distinct stages. Findings Van Gompel et al. (2001) compared the unrestricted race model against other models. Participants read three kinds of sentences (examples provided): (1) Ambiguous sentences: The burglar stabbed only the guy with the dagger during the night. (It could be the burglar or the guy who had the dagger). (2) Verb-phrase attachment: The burglar stabbed only the dog with the dagger during the night. (Here the burglar stabbed with the dagger). (3) Noun-phrase attachment: The burglar stabbed only the dog with the collar during the night. According to the garden-path model, the principle of minimal attach- ment means readers should always adopt the verb-phrase analysis. This produces rapid processing of sentences such as (2) but slow process- ing of sentences such as (3). Ambiguous sentences are processed rapidly because the verb-phrase analysis is accept- able. According to the constraint-based theory, sentences such as (2) and (3) are processed rapidly because the word mean- ings support only the correct interpretation. However, there will be competition between the two possible interpretations of sentence (1) and so processing will be slow. What actually happened? There was an ambiguity advantage: ambiguous sentences were processed faster than either of the other sentence types (see Figure 10.1). According to the unrestricted race model, readers rapidly use syntactic and semantic information in ambiguous sentences to form a syntactic structure, and no re-analysis is necessary. In contrast, re-analysis is sometimes required with noun-phrase and verb-phrase sentences. Mohamed and Clifton (2011) com- pared the same three models. Participants read temporarily ambiguous sentences (e.g., The second wife will claim the entire family inheritance for herself ). This sentence has ambiguous (the entire family inheritance) and disambiguating (for herself ) regions. The sen- tence was sometimes preceded by a context biasing the incorrect syntactic structure.

Since the actual syntactic structure is the simplest possible, the garden-path model predicts readers will not be slowed down in the ambiguous or disambiguating regions. According to the constraint-based theory, both syntactic structures are activated in the ambiguous region, which slows down reading. Readers then select one syntactic structure in the disambiguating region, which also slows reading time. According to the unrestricted race model, reading is not slowed in the ambiguous region because only one syntactic structure is produced. However, it will often be the incorrect syntactic structure, which slows reading in the disambiguating region. Which model was the winner? Reading times in the ambiguous and disambiguating regions were most consistent with the predictions of the unrestricted race model. According to the unrestricted race model, parsing terminates when a permissible syntactic structure is produced. Logačev and Vasishth (2016) argued that this assumption is too limited because it takes no account of task demands. When they asked readers to construct all possible syntactic structures, there was an ambiguity disadvantage (i.e., ambiguous sentences were processed more slowly than unambiguous ones). This finding is con- trary to the unrestricted race model’s prediction. Evaluation The unrestricted race model combines successful features of the garden-path and constraint-based models. It is reasonable that all information sources are used from the outset, and that the initial syntactic structure is retained unless subsequent evidence is inconsistent with it. It differs from most other models in predicting the surprising finding there can be an ambiguity advan- tage in sentence processing. What are the model’s limitations? First, it assumes readers and listen- ers typically identify a sentence’s correct syntactic structure. That is by no means always the case (see below). Second, the model assumes an ambi- guity advantage will typically be found. In fact, task conditions determine whether there is an ambiguity advantage or disadvantage. Good-enough representations Until recently, nearly all theories of sentence processing (including those discussed above) assumed the language processor “generates representa- tions of the linguistic input that are complete, detailed, and accurate” (Ferreira et al., 2002, p. 11). There are two reasons why this assumption is incorrect. First, as discussed earlier, many individuals with low non-verbal IQs have very limited grammatical knowledge (Dąbrowska, 2018). Second, the good-enough processing approach “emphasises the tendency of the comprehension system to perform superficial analyses of linguistic input, which sometimes result in inaccurate interpretations” (Ferreira & Lowder, 2016, p. 218). Karimi and Ferreira (2016) proposed a model of comprehension based on the notion of good-enough representations (see Figure 10.2). It assumes two routes are used in language processing, both starting at the same time. Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["t).","Data from van Gompel et al."]}

First, the heuristic route uses simple, error-prone heuristics (rules of thumb) and typically produces a rapid output. This route is “quick and dirty” but has the advantage of involving minimal effort. Second, the algorith- mic route is more demanding on resources – it uses strict and well-defined syntactic rules “to compute precise representations for the given linguistic input” (Karimi & Ferreira, 2016, p. 1014). What are the model’s implications? First, listeners and readers generally accept the output of the heuristic route as correct. Comprehenders empha- sise heuristic processing because they have limited cognitive resources and processing time is limited. Second, if the output of the heuristic route is not accepted as correct (or listeners and readers strive for high levels of comprehension accuracy), algorithmic processing continues and typically determines the outcome of the comprehension process. Third, individuals with poor comprehension skills are less likely than those with good comprehension skills to make effective use of algorithmic processing. Findings As predicted by the model, comprehension processes are often superficial and inaccurate. For example, consider the Moses illusion. When asked “How many animals of each sort did Moses put on the ark?”, approximately 50% of people reply “Two”. In fact, the correct answer is “None” (think about it!). The Moses illusion occurs because of superficial or heuristic processing. Successful avoidance of the Moses illusion requires more thor- ough processing to inhibit the outcome of heuristic processing (Raposo & Marques, 2013). In similar fashion, Ferreira (2003) found listeners who heard “The mouse was eaten by the cheese” sometimes misinterpreted it as meaning the mouse ate the cheese! Ferreira argued this was due to a common heuristic (the noun-verb-noun or NVN strategy). This involves the assumption that the subject of a sentence is the agent of some action whereas the object is Heuristic route Interim output equilibrium Algorithmic route Interim output refned if necessary Time Final output Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["es two routes are used in language processing, both starting at the same time.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

We use this heuristic because most English sentences conform to this pattern. Christianson et al. (2010) argued that listeners in the Ferreira (2003) study faced a conflict between the syntactic structure of the passive sentences and their semantic knowledge of what is typically the case. They found listeners hearing implausible passive sentences (e.g., “The angler was caught by the fish”) paid little attention to their syntactic structure. Swets et al. (2008) argued readers would engage in increased algorith- mic processing if they anticipated detailed (rather than superficial) compre- hension questions. Participants read sentences more slowly in the former case (see Figure 10.3). Ambiguous sentences were read more rapidly than unambiguous ones when superficial questions were asked (suggesting heu- ristic processing). However, this ambiguity advantage disappeared when more challenging comprehension questions were anticipated (suggesting more algorithmic processing). Reliance on heuristic processing can be so great that readers fail to repair their preferred syntactic structure of a sentence even when inade- quate. Ferreira and Lowder (2016) discussed studies where readers received sentences such as “While Anna bathed the baby played in the crib”. Many readers mistakenly understood this sentence to mean Anna bathed the baby and the baby played in the crib. What happened was many readers ini- tially assumed Anna bathed the baby and maintained this assumption even though this structure breaks down when they reach the verb played which then has no subject. Finally, we consider individual differences. Individuals high in working memory capacity (high intelligence and attentional control; see Glossary) answered comprehension questions about garden-path sentences 70% Figure 10.3 Sentence reading times as a function of the way in which comprehension was assessed: detailed (relative clause) questions; superficial questions on all trials; or occasional superficial questions.

In contrast, the comparable figure for those low in working memory capacity was 50% (chance performance) (MacDonald et al., 1992). Evaluation Sentence comprehension can depend on precise algorithmic processes or imprecise heuristic ones. As predicted by the model, language processing often uses good-enough representations and so is error-prone. It follows from the model that language processing should be flexible. As predicted, there is more evidence of algorithmic processing when readers or listen- ers have high IQ or working memory capacity or when they are expecting detailed comprehension questions. What are the model’s limitations? First, as Karimi and Ferreira (2016, p. 1019) admitted, “The nature of the simple rules that guide heuristic pro- cessing is unclear”. Second, heuristic processing can involve very limited processing or top-down semantic processing (e.g., the Moses illusion). It is not clear all forms of heuristic processing (especially top-down semantic processing) are relatively effortless (Koornneef & Reuland, 2016). Third, it is often assumed theoretically that re-analysis of ambiguous sentences using precise or algorithmic processes reduces misinterpretations. According to this viewpoint, readers spending the most time processing the disambiguating region of ambiguous sentences should be less likely to mis- interpret them. However, Qian et al. (2018; discussed above, p. 467), found that spending extra time processing the disambiguating region (and so pre- sumably engaging in re-analysis) was ineffective when events described in the misinterpretation seemed highly probable. Fourth, it is assumed within the model that misinterpretations of sen- tences such as “The mouse was eaten by the cheese” occur because heuristic processing produces incorrect syntactic representations. However, there is another possibility. Perhaps listeners/readers typically form correct syntac- tic representations with misinterpretations due to memory limitations (i.e., incomplete retrieval of relevant information) (Bader & Meng, 2018). The crucial point is that misinterpretation errors may reflect processes (e.g., involving memory) occurring after an initial correct sentence interpretation. Cognitive neuroscience: event-related potentials Cognitive neuroscience has enhanced our understanding of parsing and sentence comprehension. Since the precise timing of different processes is so important, much use has been made of event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary). As we will see, semantic information of various kinds is actively processed very early on, which is broadly consistent with predic- tions from the constraint-based and unrestricted race models. The literature is reviewed by Beres (2017). The N400 component in the ERP waveform is of special relevance. It is a negative wave with an onset at 250 ms and peak at 400 ms. The N400 to a sentence word is smaller when its meaning matches the sentence context. Other factors influencing N400 during sentence processing mostly relate to semantic processing. As a result, N400 has often been assumed to reflect difficulty with achieving semantic access.

As we will see, research within cognitive neuroscience has provided evidence for top-down predictive processes in sentence processing. There is further discussion of such predictive processes with respect to reading and speech perception in Chapter 9. Findings How does meaning influence initial sentence processing? The traditional view was that initially we process only word meanings with aspects of meaning going beyond the sentence itself (e.g., our world knowledge) pro- cessed subsequently. Hagoort et al. (2004) reported contrary evidence. Dutch participants read sentences such as the following (critical words are in italics): (1) The Dutch trains are yellow and very crowded. (This sentence is true). (2) The Dutch trains are sour and very crowded. (This sentence is false because of the meaning of the word “sour”). (3) The Dutch trains are white and very crowded. (This sentence is false because of world knowledge – Dutch trains are yellow). According to the traditional view, the semantic mismatch in a sentence such as (3) should have taken longer to detect than the mismatch in a sentence such as (2). However, the effects of these different kinds of semantic mis- match on N400 were very similar (see Figure 10.4). What do the above findings mean? First, “While reading a sentence, the brain retrieves and integrates word meanings and world knowledge at the same time” (Hagoort et al., 2004, p. 440). Thus, the traditional view that we process word meaning before information about world knowl- edge may be wrong. Second, word meaning and world knowledge are both integrated into the reader’s sentence comprehension within about 400 ms. This suggests sentence processing involves making almost immediate Figure 10.4 The N400 response to the critical word in a correct sentence (“The Dutch trains are yellow”: green line), a sentence incorrect on the basis of world knowledge (“The Dutch trains are white”: orange line) and a sentence incorrect on the basis of word meanings (“The Dutch trains are sour”: purple line). The N400 response was very similar with both incorrect sentences. From Hagoort et al. (2004). Reprinted with permission from AAAS.

The traditional view also assumed contextual information is processed after information about word meanings. Contrary evidence was reported by Nieuwland and van Berkum (2006a, p. 1106) using scenarios such as this one: A woman saw a dancing peanut who had a big smile on his face. The peanut was singing about a girl he had just met. And judging from the song, the peanut was totally crazy about her. The woman thought it was really cute to see the peanut singing and dancing like that. The peanut was salted/in love, and by the sound of it, this was definitely mutual. Some listeners heard “salted ”, which was appropriate in terms of word meanings but inappropriate within the story context. Others heard “in love”, which was appropriate within the story context but not word meanings. The N400 was greater for “salted ” than “in love” because it did not fit the story context. Thus, contextual information can have a very rapid major impact. Van den Brink et al. (2012) argued that listeners take rapid account of stereotyped inferences about the speaker. For example, suppose you heard a woman say “I have a large tattoo on my back”. This would conflict with stereotypical views if she had an upper-class accent but not if she had a working-class accent. As predicted, there was a larger N400 to the word “tattoo” when spoken in an upper-class accent. Evaluation Behavioural measures (e.g., time to read a sentence) provide only indirect evidence concerning the nature and timing of underlying language pro- cesses. In contrast, research using event-related potentials indicates listeners make use of several kinds of information (e.g., context; world knowledge; knowledge of the speaker; syntax) very early in processing, before the end of each spoken word. Such findings are more supportive of constraint-based theories than the garden-path model. How can we explain the above findings? According to Hagoort (2017, p. 200), Very likely, lexical, semantic and syntactic cues conspire to predict characteristics of the next anticipated word, including its syntactic and semantic make-up. A mismatch between contextual prediction and the output of bottom-up analysis results in an immediate brain response recruiting additional processing resources for the sake of salvaging the on-line interpretation process. More research using event-related potentials to assess the extent to which readers/listeners predict upcoming text is discussed in the section entitled “Discourse processes: inferences” (see pp. 490–498).

Findings are generally similar in word-by-word and free reading. However, comprehension is better in free reading because it permits regressions (eyes moving backwards in the text) (Metzner et al., 2017). These regressions are associated with a P600 effect (an ERP component produced by syntactic and semantic violations in the text). Second, much research differs from naturalistic language compre- hension in important ways. The latter more often involves processes not specific to language (e.g., relating text to pre-existing knowledge and to context) whereas the former is generally concerned primarily with language processing (Hasson et al., 2018). Third, a small N400 to a predictable word in a sentence may indicate successful prediction. Alternatively, however, it might also indicate easy integration of that word into the developing sentence meaning. PRAGMATICS Pragmatics is concerned with practical language use and comprehension. It relates to the intended rather than literal meaning expressed by speak- ers and understood by listeners and often involves drawing inferences. For example, we assume someone who says “The weather’s really great!”, when it has been raining non-stop for several days, actually thinks the weather is terrible. Pragmatics is also important when readers comprehend text. Pragmatics is “meaning minus semantics”. Suppose someone says something in an unfamiliar language. Using a dictionary would partly clarify what the speaker intended to communicate. Most of what the dic- tionary (plus knowledge of the language’s grammatical structure) fails to tell you about the speaker’s intended meaning lies within the field of prag- matics. A full understanding of intended meaning generally requires taking account of contextual information (e.g., the speaker’s tone; the speaker’s relevant behaviour; the current environment). An important area within pragmatics is figurative language (language not intended to be taken literally). Metaphor is figurative language where a word or phrase is used figuratively to mean something it resembles (e.g., “Time is a thief”). There is also irony where the intended meaning differs substantially from the literal meaning. Here is an example from the film Dr Strangelove: “Gentlemen, you can’t fight in here! This is the War Room.” There are also idioms, which are common figurative expressions (e.g., “kick the bucket”. Bohrn et al. (2012) carried out a meta-analysis (see Glossary) compar- ing brain activation with figurative and literal language processing. There were two main findings: (1) Figurative language processing involves essentially the same brain network as literal processing. (2) Several areas in (and close) to the inferior frontal gyrus (BA45/36/47/13) (especially in the left hemisphere) were more activated during figu- rative than literal language processing. Häuser et al. (2016) applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; see Glossary) to part of this network (BA45), which they hypothesised provides KEY TERMS Pragmatics The study of the ways language is used and understood in the real world including a consideration of its intended meaning; in general, the impact of contextual factors on meaning.

As predicted, rTMS impaired the processing of idioms involving maximal semantic con- flict between literal and idiomatic meanings. IN THE REAL WORLD: AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDERS AND PRAGMATICS We can see the importance of pragmatics by studying individuals who have difficulty in distin- guishing between literal and intended meanings. For example, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are poor at understanding others’ intentions and beliefs and so find social com- munication very hard. They also have weak central coherence (the ability to integrate information from different sources). It follows that individuals with autism spectrum disorder should have severe problems understanding the intended meanings of figurative language. Much evidence has been obtained from individuals with Asperger syndrome (relatively mild ASD). Children with Asperger’s often develop language normally but have impaired pragmatic language comprehension (see Volden, 2017, for a review). For example, Kaland et al. (2005) found they were deficient at drawing inferences when presented with jokes, white lies, figurative lan- guage or irony. Here is an example involving irony: Ann’s mother has spent a long time cooking Ann’s favourite meal: fish and chips. But when she brings it to Ann, she is watching TV, and she doesn’t even say thank you. Ann’s mother is cross and says, “Well, that’s very nice, isn’t it! That is what I call politeness!” Individuals with Asperger syndrome were less able than healthy controls to explain why Ann’s mother said what she did. This illustrates their general inability to understand what other people are thinking. Of importance, Asperger’s individuals were comparable to controls when drawing inferences not requiring social understanding. Loukusa et al. (2018) extended the findings of Kaland et al. (2005). Two factors were jointly responsible for the impaired ability of children with ASD to draw correct pragmatic inferences during comprehension. First, they had problems taking account of the context. Second, they found it hard to infer someone’s thoughts and feelings from what that person said. The deficit in correct pragmatic inferences by ASD children went from 25% when only context was important to 48% when someone’s else thoughts and feeling were also important. As mentioned already, deficient pragmatic language comprehension in individuals with Asperger syndrome is partly due to weak central coherence. Zalla et al. (2014) asked participants to decide whether a speaker’s compliments to another person were literal or ironic. Healthy controls correctly recognised a speaker was being ironic if they had a sarcastic/ironic occupation (e.g., comedian; chat show host). In contrast, individuals with Asperger’s typically ignored information about the speaker’s occupation. Language impairments in autism spectrum disorder are not always specific to pragmatic lan- guage. Whyte and Nelson (2015) found children with ASD also had poorer knowledge of syntax and vocabulary. These language deficits mostly explained their impaired pragmatic language comprehension. In sum, individuals with ASD have impaired pragmatic language comprehension especially when they need to take account of context and someone else’s thoughts and feelings. Their great diffi- culty in inferring others’ intentions and motivations from what they say and how they behave plays a significant role in restricting their social horizons.

For example, consider the unfamiliar metaphor “My mother says envy is rust” (George & Wiley, 2016). The reader (or listener) has to ignore the relatively meaningless literal meaning and identify the metaphorical meaning (i.e., envy is like rust because it is corrosive). Olkoniemi et al. (2016) obtained evidence suggesting that metaphor comprehension can be relatively demanding. Readers low in working memory capacity (associated with low intelligence; see Glossary) required more processing time to comprehend metaphors. Theoretical approaches to metaphor comprehension are reviewed in detail by Holyoak and Stamenković (2018). According to the traditional standard pragmatic model (e.g., Grice, 1975), three sequential stages are involved in processing metaphorical and other figurative statements: (1) the literal meaning is accessed; (2) the reader or listener decides whether the literal meaning makes sense in the current context; (3) if the literal meaning is inadequate, there is a search for a suitable non-literal meaning. This model is oversimplified. Suppose we ask people to decide whether sentences are literally true or false. According to the model, they should not access the figurative meanings of metaphors on this task and so should respond rapidly. However, that is not the case. Chouinard et al. (2018) found participants took longer to decide whether metaphorical sentences were literally true or false than when judging control sentences (literally false; scrambled metaphor, e.g., “Some cats are ribbons”; see Figure 10.5). This is the metaphor interference effect. Why is the metaphor interference effect important? As Chouinard et al. (2018, p. 14) concluded, it shows “metaphorical and literal meanings are generated automatically and simultaneously during comprehension”.

Lacey et al. (2017) tested this viewpoint. Participants were presented with metaphorical (e.g., “He had to foot the bill”) and literal (e.g., “He had to pay the bill”). All the metaphorical sentences referred to body parts. The key finding was that brain areas responsive to images of body parts were activated only by the metaphorical sentences. These findings indicate that comprehension of metaphors can be perceptually grounded. Predication model Kintsch (2000) proposed a predication model of metaphor comprehension involving two components: (1) The latent semantic analysis component: this represents word mean- ings based on their relations with other words. Kintsch (2000) spec- ulated that metaphor comprehension is facilitated when both nouns in a metaphor (e.g., “Lawyers are sharks”) have strong semantic rela- tionships to numerous other words because that facilitates the task of establishing connections between them. (2) The construction-integration component: this uses information from the first component to construct interpretations of statements. Consider the statement “Lawyers are sharks”. It has an argument (lawyers) and a predicate or assertion (sharks). This component selects predicate features relevant to the argument (e.g., vicious; aggressive) and inhibits irrelevant predicate features (e.g., have fins; swim). Wolff and Gentner (2011) agreed with Kintsch (2000) that metaphors involve a directional process with information from the argument (e.g., lawyers) being projected on to the predicate (e.g., sharks). However, they also argued this directional process is preceded by a non-directional process identifying commonalities in meaning between the argument and predicate. Findings The non-reversibility of metaphors is an important phenomenon. For example, “My surgeon is a butcher” means something very different to “My butcher is a surgeon”. Kintsch’s (2000) model explains non-reversibility by assuming only those features of the predicate (second noun) relevant to the argument (first noun) are selected. Thus, changing the argument changes the features selected. Suppose we try to understand a metaphor such as “My lawyer was a shark”. According to Kintsch’s model, this should be harder to understand when literal properties of sharks (e.g., can swim) irrelevant to its metaphor- ical meaning have recently been activated. McGlone and Manfredi (2001) found (as predicted by the model) that the above metaphor took longer to understand when preceded by a contextual sentence emphasising the literal meaning of shark (e.g., “Sharks can swim”).

From Solomon & Thompson- Schill (2017). Reprinted with permission of Elsevier. According to the predication model, understanding metaphors involves inhibiting the semantic properties of the predicate irrelevant to the argument. Solomon and Thompson-Schill (2017) tested this assumption. Participants saw metaphors (e.g., “The prisoners are sardines”) and literal sentences (e.g., “The fish are sardines”). After that, participants decided whether a metaphor-relevant property (e.g., canned) or metaphor- irrelevant property (e.g., salty) was true of the last word in the sentence (e.g., sar- dines). Participants verified object properties more slowly following a met- aphorical sentence (the MET condition in Figure 10.6) compared to a literal one (the LIT condition in Figure 10.6). Thus, participants inhibited metaphor- irrelevant information while reading metaphorical sentences. Carriedo et al. (2016) investigated the effects of individual differences in inhibitory processes on metaphor comprehension. As predicted, indi- viduals having superior inhibitory processes exhibit the best metaphor comprehension. According to Kintsch (2000), metaphor comprehension should be greater when both nouns in a metaphor are similar in meaning to numer- ous other words. However, Al-Azary and Buchanan (2017) obtained the opposite findings. They speculated that the activation of numerous seman- tically similar words might make it harder to find shared meanings between the two nouns. According to Wolff and Gentner (2011), initial processing of meta- phors involves a non-directional process focusing on finding overlapping meanings between the argument and predicate. This process is the same whether participants see forward metaphors (e.g., Some giraffes are sky- scrapers) or reversed metaphors (e.g., Some skyscrapers are giraffes). It follows that rated comprehensibility should be the same for forward and reversed metaphors if participants must respond rapidly. In contrast, com- prehensibility rating should be much higher for forward than reversed met- aphors if participants have sufficient time for thorough processing.

There were four statement types: literal; forward metaphors; reversed metaphors; and scrambled metaphors. From Wolff and Gentner (2011). Evaluation What are the strengths of research in this area? First, it has been established that metaphor processing depends on many factors, including the listener’s language ability, the familiarity of the metaphor, and the listener’s goal (e.g., understanding a metaphor; judging its appropriateness in context) (Gibbs, 2013). Second, findings indicate that literal and metaphorical mean- ings are processed simultaneously. Third, inhibitory processes play a key role in diminishing the impact of irrelevant information. Fourth, metaphor comprehension involves a non-directional process followed by a directional one. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, insufficient attention has been paid to possible processing differences between different types of metaphors. For example, we can distinguish between “A is B” metaphors and correlation metaphors (Gibbs, 2013). “Lawyers are sharks” is an example of the former whereas “My research is off to a great start” is an example of the latter. Kintsch’s (2000) prediction model is more appli- cable to the former type of metaphor than the latter. Second, most research has not distinguished clearly between novel and familiar metaphors. George and Wiley (2016) found participants took longer to think of interpretations of novel than familiar metaphors (7.6 seconds vs 4.9 seconds, respectively). Of importance, inhibitory processes were used less often with familiar metaphors, perhaps because overall processing demands were much less.

Of direct, relevance, speakers and listeners need to take account of the common ground, which “describes a body of information that people alleg- edly share” (Cowley and Harvey, 2016, p. 56). Listeners expect speakers to refer mostly to information and knowledge that falls in the common ground and often experience difficulties if that is not the case. The extent to which that expectation is correct is discussed in Chapter 11 (see pp. 544–547). Note that a major goal of conversation is to extend the common ground between those involved (Brown-Schmidt & Heller, 2014). Keysar et al. (2000) accepted listeners would benefit from using the common ground existing between them and the speaker. However, this can be very effortful for listeners, and so they generally resort to a rapid and non-effortful egocentric heuristic. The egocentric heuristic is “a ten- dency to consider as potential referents objects that are not in the common ground, but are potential referents from one’s own perspective” (Keysar et al., 2000, p. 32). Use of the egocentric heuristic will often cause listeners to misunderstand the speaker’s message. Accordingly, Keysar argued that listeners sometimes follow use of the egocentric heuristic with an effortful process of trying to adopt the speaker’s perspective. Several theorists (e.g., Bezuidenhout, 2014) have disagreed that lis- teners typically make use of the egocentric heuristic. Instead, they argue listeners generally take account of the common ground very early in pro- cessing. Heller et al. (2016) claimed it is simplistic to assume listeners adopt a single perspective (egocentric or that of the common ground). Instead, listeners use both perspectives simultaneously. Findings In Keysar’s research (e.g., Keysar et al., 2000), listeners often used the ego- centric heuristic and ignored the common ground. However, many studies (e.g., Heller et al., 2016, discussed shortly) have found the opposite. How can we resolve these inconsistencies? Dębska and Rączaszek-Leonardi (2018) argued that Keysar’s approach was biased. Suppose listeners were instructed to “Put the small candle . . .” from an array containing three candles (big, medium and small). The candle hidden from the speaker was always the smallest one. Thus, one reason why listeners used the egocentric heuristic by selecting the smallest candle was because it was the one best described by the instructions. Dębska and Rączaszek-Leonardi (2018) tested the above ideas by using a set-up resembling that of Keysar. Listeners showed less evidence of the egocentric heuristic when the object hidden from the speaker was not the one best described by the instructions. Heller et al. (2016) tested the various theories mentioned earlier. Figure 10.8 illustrates their four conditions viewing the display from the listener’s perspective when the task was to move the big candle (inside the white oval). In the baseline conditions, all four objects were in common ground. In the crucial privileged conditions, one object was visible only to KEY TERMS Common ground Shared knowledge and beliefs possessed by a speaker and a listener; its use facilitates communication.

In the pairs conditions, two pairs of objects differed in size, and in the triplet conditions, three similar objects differed in size and there was also a completely different object. Eye-tracking assessed listeners’ attentional focus. What would we predict for the crucial privileged conditions? We start with the privileged triplet condition. If listeners used the egocentric heuris- tic, they would mistakenly focus on the candle the speaker could not see (bottom left). If they used common ground information, in contrast, they would focus on the larger of the two candles the speaker could see (bottom right). There was some evidence for the egocentric heuristic because listen- ers focused to some extent on the candle the speaker could not see (privi- leged big candle; see Figure 10.9). However, common ground information was also used – listeners consistently fixated the target rapidly and to a much greater extent than any other object. The privileged triplet condition is biased to elicit the egocentric heuris- tic in that the object only the listener could see fitted the speaker’s instruc- tions better than the intended target. This is not the case in the privileged pairs condition. In this condition, use of the egocentric heuristic would lead to equal fixations on the big funnel and the big candle (the target) when the speaker has said “Pick up the big . . .”, but has not yet said “candle”.

However, there was some evidence of the egocentric heuristic – listeners had some fixations on the object only they could see (i.e., the small funnel) and also on the irrelevant big funnel. In sum, Heller et al.’s (2016) findings indicate that listeners rapidly use common ground. Of greatest importance, their findings are most consistent with the theory that listeners make simultaneous use of an egocentric per- spective and common ground. Suppose listeners who were given a task resembling the privileged triplet condition in Heller et al.’s (2016) study performed a demanding second task at the same time. According to Keysar et al.’s (2000) theory, this should increase their use of the egocentric heuristic (compared to a control condition with an undemanding second task) because they would lack the processing resources to make use of the common ground. Lin et al. (2010) carried out a study along those lines and obtained the predicted findings. Cane et al. (2018) obtained similar findings using the demanding task of remembering a sequence of five digits. Luk et al. (2012) studied cultural differences in use of the egocentric heuristic. Chinese–English bilinguals were primed to focus on the Chinese or American culture. Only 5% of those focusing on the Chinese culture used the egocentric heuristic on a listening task compared to 45% focusing on the American culture.

Most research has focused only on whether specific pieces of infor- mation are in common ground. This ignores the potential richness of common ground representations, which can include cultural and commu- nity information shared by speaker and listener. Brown-Schmidt (2012) used a task where two individuals worked together to move various game pieces. Their interactive discussions led to the formation and maintenance of rich common ground representations. Brown-Schmidt also found that the assumption that a given piece of information is or is not in common ground between a speaker and listener is oversimplified. In fact, a given piece of information can be in common ground to a greater or lesser extent. Nearly all research in this area is limited because speakers and listeners are strangers to each other. We might assume friends share more common ground than strangers and so rely less on the egocentric heuristic. However, Savitsky et al. (2011) obtained the opposite finding because friends over- estimated how well they communicated with each other. Evaluation The evidence suggests listeners make simultaneous use of both their egocen- tric perspective and common ground. However, several factors influence the relative importance of these two perspectives. First, the egocentric per- spective is used more often when the object hidden from the speaker is the one best described by the instructions. Second, the egocentric perspective is more frequent when listeners have limited processing resources avail able. Second, it is used more often in Western cultures than in Eastern ones. Third, the egocentric perspective may be used more often by listeners when the speaker is a friend of theirs rather than a stranger. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, most research has focused on very specific aspects of common ground. Second, findings from listener–speaker pairs who are strangers may not generalise to pairs who are friends. Third, many studies lack ecological validity (see Glossary): it is rare in everyday life for an object between two individuals to be visible to the listener but not to the speaker. Fourth, in most research, the participants act only as listeners. In contrast, real-life conversations involve rapid switching between listening and speaking. In such situations, it is often useful for listeners to focus on information available only to them (and thus not in the common ground) so they can communicate it to the other person (Mozuraitis et al., 2015). INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES: WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY There are considerable individual differences in almost all complex cogni- tive activities. Accordingly, theories based on the assumption (explicit or implicit) that everyone comprehends text similarly are oversimplified. What are the most important individual differences influencing reading perfor- mance?

Engle and Kane (2004) proposed an influential theory according to which individuals with high working memory capacity have superior executive attention or attentional control than low-capacity individ- uals. This manifests itself in the superior monitoring of task goals and the ability to resolve response competition. It follows that high-capacity individuals should have less mind-wandering (task-unrelated thoughts) than low-capacity ones while engaged in reading comprehension. As predicted, Unsworth and McMillan (2013) found high-capacity individ- uals had superior reading comprehension partly because of their reduced mind-wandering. There are two key theoretical issues relating to the effects of working memory capacity on reading comprehension. First, we can focus on rel- atively specific individual differences in working memory capacity (e.g., verbal working memory involving simultaneous processing and storage of verbal information). An example is reading span (see Glossary). Alternatively, we can focus on general individual differences in working memory capacity (working memory involving simultaneous processing and storage of different kinds of information). An example is operation span IN THE REAL WORLD: UNDERSTANDING NON-NATIVE SPEAKERS As Ryskin et al. (2018, p. 141) pointed out, “Everyday language use occurs amid myriad sources of noise”. For example, non-native speakers may make errors because of deficient knowledge of the language including numerous mispronunciations when engaged in conversation (Levis & Barriuso, 2011). In such circumstances, listeners have to infer the intended meaning from what is actually said. How do we cope when trying to understand what a non-native speaker is saying? A crucial part of the answer was provided by Lev-Ari (2014) in a study where a native speaker of Mandarin or of English gave instructions in English to native English speakers. Listeners to the non-native speaker increased their reliance on top-down processes (e.g., predicting what the speaker would say next) and reduced their reliance on what the speaker said. This strategy is entirely appropriate given the lower language competence of the non-native speaker. Gibson et al. (2017) also found listeners relied less on the actual words spoken by non-native speakers and focused more on the intended meaning. Native and non-native speakers produced many utterances, some of which were implausible (e.g., “The tax law benefitted from the busi- nessman”). Listeners were more likely to interpret such implausible utterances as plausible (e.g., “The businessman benefited from the tax law”) when spoken by a non-native speaker. This makes sense given the assumption that non-native speakers are more likely to put words in the wrong order. Suppose a listener is exposed to the utterances of a non-native speaker whose errors consist mainly of deletions (e.g., “We had nice time at the beach”) or insertions (e.g., “The earthquake shattered from the house”). Listeners might simply assume in both cases that the speaker makes many errors across the board. Alternatively, they might assume the speaker only has a high proba- bility of making specific speech errors (e.g., deletions or insertions). Ryskin et al. (2018) found that listeners’ inferences about the speaker’s intended meaning were influenced by the specific errors they had heard previously. Thus, listeners are sensitive to fine-grained information about the types of errors made by speakers.

Are specific or general aspects of working memory capacity more important in predicting reading comprehension? Second, there are two possible types of explanation for positive cor- relations between working memory capacity and reading comprehension. Just and Carpenter (1992) assumed there was a direct relationship: indi- viduals with low working memory capacity have more limited processing resources than high-capacity individuals and this directly impairs their reading comprehension. Alternatively, there may be an indirect relation- ship: the effects of working memory capacity on reading comprehension may occur because it correlates with other reading-relevant factors (e.g., vocabulary; reading experience). Why does it matter whether the relationship is direct or indirect? In essence, if the relationship between working memory capacity and reading is indirect, it implies factors other than working memory capacity itself are primarily responsible for its effects on reading performance. Findings Peng et al. (2018) reported a meta-analytic review based on 197 studies. Overall, they reported a correlation of +.29 between working memory capacity and reading. Measures of general working memory capacity cor- related +.26 with reading comprehension. Among specific measures, the correlation between verbal working memory capacity and reading was somewhat higher (+.32). Thus, general and specific individual differences in working memory capacity are both important predictors of reading performance. Peng et al. (2018) also addressed the issue whether the effects of working memory capacity on reading comprehension are direct or indirect. More specifically, two factors they considered were vocabulary size and decoding (“the ability to translate written language into speech with accu- racy and/or fluency”, p. 52). They obtained evidence for indirect effects: working memory capacity influenced reading comprehension via its effects on vocabulary and decoding. Freed et al. (2017) also considered whether the effects on reading com- prehension of working memory capacity are direct or indirect. They dis- covered the relationship between working memory capacity and reading comprehension was indirect. It depended on two factors: language experi- ence (e.g., reading habits) and general reasoning ability or fluid intelligence (see Glossary). Evaluation Theoretical approaches such as that of Just and Carpenter (1992) have the advantage over most language theories in emphasising the importance of individual differences. In contrast, as Kidd et al. (2018, p. 154) pointed out, most theorists regard large individual differences in language comprehen- sion as “an inconvenient truth” which they ignore or de-emphasise. Individual differences in working memory capacity correlate moder- ately highly with measures of reading comprehension.

Other research suggest- ing the importance of working memory capacity is discussed in the next section (see p. 494). What are the limitations of research in this area? First, We have a huge literature . . . that has focused on the role of WMC [working memory capacity] in language processing, based on the assumption that WMC has a unique and direct effect on comprehen- sion. However, only one major study has found such an effect. (Freed et al., 2017, p. 137) Second, and related to the first point, much more research is required to clarify the interrelationships between the numerous individual difference variables correlating with reading comprehension. For example, Van Dyke et al. (2014) found IQ correlated +.61 with working memory capacity, and that much of the relationship between working memory capacity and reading comprehension depended on IQ. DISCOURSE PROCESSING: INFERENCES So far we have focused primarily on comprehension of single sentences. In real life, however, we mostly encounter connected discourse (speech or written speech at least several sentences long). Single sentences and dis- course differ in various ways. First, single sentences are more likely to be ambiguous because they lack the context provided by previous sentences within discourse. Second, discourse processing typically requires inference drawing for full comprehension. We draw numerous inferences when exposed to discourse (even though we are generally unaware of doing so). Why is so much inference drawing required? Readers and listeners would be bored to tears if writers and speakers spelled everything out in incredible detail. Test your skill at inference drawing with this example taken from Rumelhart and Ortony (1977): Mary heard the ice-cream van coming. She remembered the pocket money. She rushed into the house. You probably inferred that Mary wanted to buy some ice cream, that buying ice cream costs money, that Mary had some pocket money in the house, and that Mary had only limited time to get hold of some money before the ice-cream van appeared. None of these inferences is explicitly stated. There are several types of inference. First, logical inferences depend only on the meanings of words. For example, we infer that a widow is female. Second, bridging inferences establish coherence between the current part of the text and the preceding text and so are also known as backward inferences. KEY TERMS Discourse Language that is a minimum of several sentences in length; it includes written text and connected speech. Logical inferences Inferences that follow necessarily from the meanings of word (e.g., a bachelor is a man who is unmarried). Bridging inferences Inferences or conclusions drawn to increase coherence between the current and preceding parts of a text; also known as backward inferences.

Predictive infer- ences (or forward inferences) are an important form of elaborative infer- ence. Predictive inferences “allow readers to generate expectations about what will happen next in a text” (Virtue et al., 2017, p. 456). It is hard to work out how we typically access relevant information from our huge store of world knowledge when forming elaborative inferences. The differences between bridging and elaborative inferences are not always clear-cut. Consider the following scenario (Kuperberg et al., 2011): Jill had very fair skin. She forgot to put sunscreen on. She had sunburn on Monday. When readers read the second sentence, they could draw the elaborative inference that Jill had sunburn. When they read the third sentence, they could draw the bridging or backward inference that the sunburn has resulted from forgetting to put on sunscreen. Theoretical perspectives Readers (and listeners) typically draw logical and bridging inferences, which are generally required for full comprehension. However, the number and nature of elaborative inferences (including predictive inferences) drawn remain controversial. Bransford et al. (1972) in their constructionist approach argued readers typically construct a fairly complete “mental model” of the situ- ation described in a text. They assumed numerous elaborative inferences are drawn during reading even when not essential for comprehension. Several theories of discourse comprehension (including the construction- integration model, the event-indexing model, and the event-segmentation theory) involve very similar assumptions (see the later section entitled “Discourse comprehension: theoretical approaches”, pp. 498–510). McKoon and Ratcliff’s (1992) minimalist hypothesis (developed by Gerrig and O’Brien, 2005) assumes far fewer inferences are drawn than does Bransford et al.’s (1972) constructionist approach. This hypothesis is based on the following assumptions: ● Inferences are automatic or strategic (goal-directed). ● Some automatic inferences establish local coherence (two or three sen- tences making sense on their own or in combination with easily avail- able general knowledge). These inferences involve parts of the text in working memory at the same time. ● Other automatic inferences rely on information readily available because it is explicitly stated in the text. ● Strategic inferences are formed in pursuit of the reader’s goals; they sometimes serve to produce local coherence. ● Most elaborative inferences are made at recall rather than during reading. KEY TERMS Elaborative inferences Inferences based on our knowledge of the world that involve adding details to a text that is being read (or speech being listened to). Predictive inferences Expectations concerning what will happen next (e.g., a new event) when reading text or listening to someone.

From van den Broek and Helder (2017). In sum, memory-based theories (e.g., minimalist hypothesis) “rely on a passive and dumb [memory] activation mechanism” (Cook & O’Brien, 2017, p. 2). In contrast, explanation-based theories (e.g., constructionist approach) “assume more interaction between basic memory mechanisms and reader goals and strategies” (Cook & O’Brien, 2017, p. 2). Van den Broek and Helder (2017) provided a theoretical framework combining elements of previous theories (see Figure 10.10). First, there are passive “automatic” processes outside the reader’s conscious control which always occur. These processes resemble those assumed within the minimal- ist hypothesis. Second, there are effortful reader-initiated processes. The extent of such processes depends on the reader’s standards of coherence: “the criteria that a reader has for what constitutes adequate comprehension and coher- ence in a particular reading situation” (p. 364). For example, if a reader’s goal includes a search after meaning, they will use more reader-initiated processes and draw more inferences than if that goal is missing (Graesser et al., 1994). These processes correspond to those assumed within the con- structionist approach. The central prediction from the above theoretical framework is as follows: When the passive processes alone yield adequate comprehension by attaining the reader’s standards of coherence, then no further pro- cessing is necessary. However, if passive processes alone lead to com- prehension falling short of satisfying the reader’s standards, then reader-initiated, coherence-building processes are likely. (van den Broek & Helder, 2017, p. 364) Research relevant to the various theoretical approaches discussed above is discussed later (pp. 494–497). Passive Standards of coherence?

Anaphor resolution is a very common form of bridging inference. Here is an example: Fred sold John his lawn mower, and then he sold him his garden hose. It requires a bridging inference to realise the referent for “he” is Fred rather than John. How do readers/listeners draw appropriate anaphoric inferences? Gender information can be very helpful. Compare ease of anaphor resolu- tion with the following sentence compared to the one above: Juliet sold John her lawn mower, and then she sold him her garden hose. Anaphor resolution is also facilitated by having pronouns in the expected order. Harley (2013) provided the following example: (1) Vlad sold Dirk his broomstick because he hated it. (2) Vlad sold Dirk his broomstick because he needed it. The first sentence is easy to understand because “he” refers to the first- named man (i.e., Vlad). The second sentence is harder to understand because “he” refers to the second-named man (i.e., Dirk). Another factor influencing anaphor resolution is working memory capacity (see Glossary). Nieuwland and van Berkum (2006b) presented sentences containing pronouns whose referents were ambiguous. Readers high in working memory capacity were more likely to take account of both possible referents. When pronouns have only a single possible referent, it has often been assumed readers “automatically” identify the correct one. Love and McKoon (2011) obtained support for this assumption only when readers were highly engaged with the text. Most findings are consistent with Kaiser et al.’s (2009) assumption that anaphor resolution involves multiple constraints (e.g., gender; meaning) operating interactively in parallel. Itzhak and Baum (2015) studied one such constraint (i.e., verb bias) as in the following example: (1) John envied Bill because he was rich. (2) John envied Bill because he was poor. Sentence (1) is easier to comprehend than sentence (2) because we expect the pronoun he to refer to Bill. Itzhak and Baum (2015) argued anaphor resolution would be easier with sentence (2) if the referent of he (i.e., John) were emphasised when the sentence was spoken. That is what they found, thus showing an interaction between verb bias and noun emphasis. KEY TERM Anaphor A word or phrase that refers back to a previous word or phrase (e.g., a pronoun may refer back to a given individual mentioned earlier).

They require readers to work out the causal relationship between the current sentence and a previous one. Consider the following two sentences: Ken drove to London yesterday. The car kept overheating. You had no trouble (hopefully!) in linking these sentences based on the assumption that Ken drove to London in a car that kept overheating. The above bridging inference may occur because the verb drove in the first sentence activated concepts relating to driving (especially car). Alternatively, readers may form a representation of the situation described in the first sentence and then relate information in the second sentence to it. The crucial difference is that the sentential context is only relevant with the second explanation. Garrod and Terras (2000) identified two stages in forming bridging inferences. The first stage is bonding, a low-level process involving the auto- matic activation of words from the preceding sentence (explanation one). The second stage is resolution, which ensures the overall interpretation is consistent with the contextual information (explanation two). Resolution is influenced by context but bonding is not. According to the minimalist hypothesis and van den Broek and Helder’s (2017) theoretical framework, the reader’s goals influence which inferences are drawn. Calvo et al. (2006) gave some participants the goal of reading sentences for comprehension whereas others were explicitly told to anticipate what might happen next. Participants in the latter condition drew more predictive inferences. Even when participants in the former con- dition drew predictive inferences, they did so more slowly than those in the anticipation condition. Earlier (see pp. 488–490), we discussed how individual differences in working memory capacity influence language comprehension. Such indi- vidual differences also influence inference drawing. Barreyro et al. (2012) found readers with high working memory capacity drew more elaborative causal inferences than did low-capacity readers. Of relevance, there is a moderately high correlation between working memory capacity and IQ (intelligence). However, Christopher et al. (2012) found working memory capacity still predicted comprehension performance after controlling for intelligence. Murray and Burke (2003) focused on predictive inferences (e.g., infer- ring break when presented with a sentence such as The angry husband threw the fragile vase against the wall. Only participants with high reading skill drew such inferences “automatically’. In general, individuals with poor reading skills draw fewer inferences than those with good reading skills McKoon & Ratcliff, 2017). In sum, research on individual differences in inference drawing and comprehension ability is important. Any adequate theory of language com- prehension (or inference drawing) must provide an explanation for such individual differences.

This issue was addressed by Gras et al. (2012) using short texts such as the following: Charlotte was having her breakfast on the terrace when the bees started flying about the pot of jam. She made a movement to brush them away but one of them succeeded in landing on her arm. The predictive inference is that Charlotte felt a sting. Gras et al. (2012) followed the text with the word sting presented in blue, red or green 350, 750 or 1,000 milliseconds after the text with instruc- tions to name the colour. The speed of colour naming was slowed only at IN THE REAL WORLD: ANXIETY AND INFERENCE DRAWING So far we have focused on factors determining whether readers draw inferences. It is also impor- tant (but relatively neglected) to consider which inferences are drawn when we read or listen to discourse. For example, suppose we present individuals high and low in trait anxiety (see Glossary) with ambiguous sentences such as the following: With hardly any visibility, the plane quickly approached the dangerous mountain and, at the same time, the passengers began to shout in panic. The plane . . . We might expect that high-anxious individuals would be more likely than low-anxious ones to be biased towards the negative or threatening predictive inference (i.e., the plane crashed). Calvo and Castillo (2001) tested this expectation. After reading the sentence above, participants were presented with the word “crashed” or “swerved” and named it rapidly. What did Calvo and Castillo (2001) find? When the time interval between “The plane . . .” and the word was 1,500 ms, high-anxious individuals named the word “crashed” faster than low- anxious ones and named the word “swerved” slower. Thus, high-anxious individuals were more likely to draw the threatening inference and less likely to draw the non-threatening one. This group difference disappeared when the time interval was less than 1,500 ms, suggesting the bias in predictive inferencing shown by high-anxious individuals did not depend on rapid “automatic” processes. Moser et al. (2012) obtained similar findings among individuals meeting criteria for social anxiety disorder (involving extreme fear and avoidance of social situations). They heard ambiguous sen- tence stems resolved by a negative or positive final word. Event-related potentials indicated that socially anxious listeners expected (or predicted) the negative completion more than non-anxious listeners. Do anxious individuals draw negative inferences from all ambiguous situations? Walsh et al. (2015; see Chapter 15) addressed that issue using four kinds of ambiguous text scenarios: (1) social (potential threat of social embarrassment); (2) intellectual (potential threat of appearing unin- telligent); (3) health (potential threat of severe illness; and (4) physical (potential threat of physical danger). High-anxious individuals drew more negative inferences than low-anxious ones only with the social and intellectual scenarios. This pattern of inference drawing indicates that high-anxious individuals are especially sensitive to situations involving social evaluation.

This finding suggests it took approxi- mately 1 second for the predictive inference to be drawn. The fact that par- ticipants could not prevent it from interfering with colour naming suggests it was drawn automatically. Kuperberg et al. (2011) also investigated the “automaticity” of infer- ence drawing using short scenarios such as one discussed earlier: Jill had very fair skin. She forgot to put sunscreen on. She had sunburn on Monday. Kuperberg et al. recorded event-related potentials to assess readers’ pro- cessing of these scenarios. Of particular interest was the N400 component which is larger when the meaning of the word currently being processed does not match its context. What did Kuperberg et al. (2011) find? Consider the above scenario where the word sunburn in the third sentence is highly causally related to its context. There was only a small N400 to this word. Thus, process- ing of the causal inference explaining Jill’s sunburn in terms of her fair skin and failure to use sunscreen started very rapidly and probably fairly “automatically”. Kuperberg et al. (2011) also focused on complex causal inferences using short scenarios such as the following: Jill had very fair skin. She usually remembered to wear sunscreen. She had sunburn on Monday. There was a small N400 to the word sunburn, but it was not as small as in the previous case. Thus, some inference processing is initiated very rapidly (and probably “automatically’) even with complex causal inferences.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nLanguage comprehension 497 In spite of the above findings, there are circumstances where few inferences are drawn via “automatic” or passive processes. For example, Collins and Daniel (2018) studied trained speed readers whose reading rate was 35% faster than that of untrained readers. These speed readers did not appear to draw bridging or predictive inferences even when such inferences were strongly implied by the text. Finally, listeners’ stereotypical inferences about the speaker can influ- ence sentence processing. For example, there was a large N400 when the sentence “I have a large tattoo on my back” was spoken in an upper-class accent (Van den Brink et al., 2012; discussed earlier, p. 477). Thus, listen- ers rapidly draw inferences about the kinds of statement a given speaker is likely (or unlikely) to make. Overall evaluation There is an increasing consensus on several issues: (1) Readers (and listeners) typically form bridging inferences (including causal inferences) to make coherent sense of text or speech. (2) Readers and listeners rapidly use contextual information and their world knowledge to draw inferences. (3) Many inferences (including causal and predictive ones) are often drawn relatively “automatically”. However, the extent to which this happens depends on various factors (e.g., working memory capacity; engagement with the text; reading speed). (4) Readers’ goals influence whether predictive inferences are drawn. (5) Readers with superior reading skills (including those having high working memory capacity) draw more inferences than other readers. (6) The major theories contribute to our understanding of inference drawing: The minimalist hypothesis is probably correct when the reader is very quickly reading the text, when the text lacks global coherence, and when the reader has very little background knowledge. The constructionist theory is on the mark when the reader is attempting to comprehend the text for enjoyment or mastery at a more leisurely pace. (Graesser et al., 1997, p. 183) Thus, inference drawing is very flexible. This flexibility is captured by van den Broek and Helder’s (2017) theoretical framework allowing for both passive and reader-initiated processes. What are the limitations of theory and research in this area? First, it is often hard to predict which inferences will be drawn because inference drawing depends on several interacting factors (e.g., readers’ goals and reading ability). Second, it is also hard to predict which inferences will be drawn because of theoretical imprecision. For example, it is assumed within the minimalist hypothesis that automatic inferences are drawn if the nec- essary information is “readily available”. How do we establish the precise degree of availability of some piece of information?

Fourth, we need more research on individual differences in which inferences are drawn with ambig- uous material. DISCOURSE COMPREHENSION: THEORETICAL APPROACHES If someone asks us to describe a story or book we have read recently, we discuss the main events and themes omitting the minor details. Thus, our description is highly selective based on the meaning extracted from the story while reading it and on selective processes operating at retrieval. Imagine our questioner’s reaction if our description was not selective but simply involved recalling random sentences from the story! Gomulicki (1956) demonstrated the selectivity of story comprehension and memory. Some participants wrote a précis (summary) of a story visible in front of them whereas others recalled the story from memory. Still other participants, who were provided only with each précis and recall, had great difficulty in telling them apart. Thus, story memory resembles a précis in focusing primarily on important information. Several factors determine the importance of story information. For example, statements causally connected to several other statements are judged as more important than those lacking such causal connections (Trabasso & Sperry, 1985). Other factors are discussed later. Nearly all comprehension research has presented readers with paper- based texts. In the real world, however, readers increase use e-readers or computers (e.g., when accessing information from the internet). Margolin et al. (2013) found comprehension was comparable for paper, e-reader, and computer presentation for both narrative (telling a story) and expository texts (conveying facts and information). However, comprehension and learning are often reduced when texts are presented on a computer screen rather than on paper (Sidi et al., 2016). Why is this? First, readers engage in more multi-tasking and discontinuous reading on screen. Second, screen readers tend to be more confident than paper readers about their levels of comprehension and learning. Third, in spite of this overconfidence, screen readers perform comparably to paper readers in conditions emphasising the importance of deep processing (e.g., high perceived task importance) (Sidi et al., 2017). Below we discuss several theories or models of discourse comprehen- sion starting with Bartlett’s (1932) influential schema-based approach. Numerous theories have been put proposed over the past 35 years or so (see McNamara and Magliano, 2009, for a review) and a few of the most prominent ones will be considered. Schema theory: Bartlett Our processing of texts involves relating textual information to relevant structured knowledge stored in long-term memory. What we process in texts, how we process textual information, and what we remember about texts we have read all depend heavily on such previously stored information.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nLanguage comprehension 499 Much stored knowledge consists of schemas (well-integrated packets of knowledge about the world, events, people and actions; see Chapter 7). Schemas include scripts and frames. Scripts (see Glossary) deal with knowledge about events and consequences of events whereas frames are knowledge structures referring to some aspect of the world (e.g., buildings). Ghosh and Gilboa (2014) argued schemas possess four necessary and sufficient features: (1) associative structure: schemas consist of interconnected units; (2) basis in multiple episodes: schemas consist of integrated information based on several similar events; (3) lack of unit detail: this follows from the variability of events from which any given schema is formed; (4) adaptability: schemas change and adapt as they are updated in the light of new information. Several definitions of “schema” have been proposed. For example, Bartlett (1932) attached great importance to adaptability. Of interest, this is prob- ably the feature least often found in recent definitions. Why are schemas important? First, they contain relevant information needed to understand what we hear and read. Second, schemas allow us to form expectations (e.g., of the sequence of events in a restaurant) that are generally confirmed, which makes the world relatively predictable. Third, schemas contain higher-level information (based on commonalities across events) making it easier to disregard trivial details during comprehension. Bartlett (1932) claimed persuasively that schemas strongly influence how we remember texts. More specifically, comprehension of (and memory for) texts depends on top-down processes triggered by schemas. He tested this hypothesis by presenting people with stories from a different culture to produce a conflict between the story itself and their prior knowledge. He found that what was remembered might be inaccurate because it included schematic knowledge not included in the story. Bartlett identified three main error types: (1) rationalisation (making recall more consistent with the reader’s cul- tural expectations); (2) levelling (omitting unfamiliar details); (3) sharpening (elaborating on certain details). The above errors might result from processes occurring during comprehen- sion or retrieval. Bartlett (1932) favoured the latter explanation but others (e.g., Bransford & Johnson, 1972) emphasise comprehension processes. Note that Henderson (1903) anticipated many of Bartlett’s theoretical ideas (Davis, 2018). Findings Bartlett (1932) used stories (e.g., “The War of the Ghosts”) from the North American Indian culture. Unfortunately, his studies were poorly controlled (Roediger, 2010). For example, he did not provide specific instructions: KEY TERM Rationalisation In Bartlett’s theory, errors in story recall that conform to the rememberer’s cultural expectations.

As a result, many distortions observed by Bartlett were due to conscious guessing rather than deficient memory. Gauld and Stephenson (1967) found instructions stressing the need for accurate recall (designed to reduce deliberate guessing) eliminated almost half the errors obtained using Bartlett’s original instructions. Bartlett (1932) claimed discourse or text information shows more rapid forgetting than schematic knowledge. Thus, the tendency for sche- matic knowledge to produce memory distortions should increase over time. Sulin and Dooling (1974) obtained support for this prediction. Participants received a story about a ruthless dictator identified as Gerald Martin or Adolf Hitler. It was assumed those told it concerned Hitler would activate their schematic knowledge of him. There was a recognition memory test at a short- or long-retention interval including the sentence “He hated the Jews particularly and so persecuted them”. As predicted, participants told the story was about Hitler were much more likely to falsely recognise the above Hitler-relevant sentence at the long- rather than the short retention interval. Strong evidence that memory distortions increase over time was reported by Bergman and Roediger (1999). Their participants read “The War of the Ghosts” and then recalled it three times. The proportion of recall involving major distortions increased from 27% at the shortest reten- tion interval (15 minutes) to 59% at the longest (6 months). Bartlett (1932) argued that schemas influence retrieval as well as com- prehension. Supporting evidence was reported by Anderson and Pichert (1978). Participants read a story from the perspective of a burglar or a potential homebuyer. After story recall, they recalled the story again from the alternative perspective (or schema). This time, participants recalled more information important only to the second perspective than on the first recall. Anderson et al. (1983) found that manipulating the reader’s perspective while reading selectively enhanced encoding and comprehen- sion of schema-relevant story information. Bransford and Johnson (1972) also found schemas influence story comprehension. Here is part of the story they used: The procedure is quite simple. First, you arrange items into different groups. Of course one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities that is the next step; otherwise, you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. What on earth was that all about? Listeners hearing the passage in the absence of a title rated it as incomprehensible and recalled only 2.8 idea units on average. However, listeners supplied beforehand with the title “Washing clothes” found it easy to understand and recalled 5.8 idea units on average. Having relevant schema information (i.e., the title) helped passage comprehension rather than simply acting as a retrieval cue – participants receiving the title after hearing the passage but before recall recalled only 2.6 idea units on average.

Van Kesteren et al. (2010) studied the involvement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during comprehen- sion. Viewers watched a film with the first half providing a schema for the second half. Activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during viewing of the second half depended on whether the first half was pre- sented in the typical sequential order (providing a strong schema) or out of order (providing a weak schema). Activation was greater when there was a weak schema because it was harder to integrate new information with schematic information. Evaluation Schematic knowledge assists text comprehension and memory. In addition, many distortions in memory for stories and other texts reflect the influ- ence of schematic information. More generally, schema theory emphasises the role of top-down processes in discourse comprehension and memory (Wagoner, 2013). What are the limitations of schema theories? First, “schema” has many definitions (Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014) and it is hard to ascertain the precise information contained within any given schema. Second, schema-based explanations require independent evidence of the existence of relevant schemas, but this is usually lacking. As Harley (2013) pointed out, “The primary accusation against schema and script-based approaches is that they are nothing more than re-descriptions of the data.” Third, it is unclear when a given schema will be activated. Theoretically, schemas facilitate inference drawing during text comprehension, but many inferences are not drawn. In contrast, the phrase “the five-hour journey from London to New York” activates the “plane flight schema” even though no words in the phrase have strong associations with flying by plane (Harley, 2013). Fourth, schema theories exaggerate how error prone we are in every- day life. For example, Wynn and Logie (1998) found students recalled “real-life” events experienced during their first week at university reason- ably accurately up to six months later. Fifth, Bartlett (1932) argued that schemas exert their influence at retrieval rather than during comprehension. In fact, schemas often also influence comprehension processes. Kintsch’s construction-integration model Kintsch’s views on language comprehension have been very influential. In his well-known construction-integration model, Kintsch (1988, 1998) combined elements of schema-based theories and Johnson-Laird’s mental model approach (see Chapter 14). Here are the model’s main assumptions (see Figure 10.12): (1) Readers turn text sentences in the text into propositions (true or false statements) representing their meaning. KEY TERM Proposition A statement making an assertion or denial which can be true or false.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\n502 Language (2) The propositions constructed from the text are stored briefly along with associatively related propositions (e.g., inferences). At this stage, many irrelevant propositions are stored. (3) Spreading activation (see Glossary) selects propositions for the text representation. In this integration process, clusters of highly inter- connected propositions attract most activation and have the great- est probability of inclusion in the text representation. Within the text representation, it is hard to distinguish between propositions based directly on the text and those based on inferences. (4) As a result of the above processes, three levels of text representation can be constructed: (i) surface representation (the text itself); (ii) propositional representation or textbase (propositions formed from the text); (iii) situation representation (a mental model describing the situ- ation referred to in the text) – this is the only representation depending mostly on the integration process. The construction-integration model sounds rather (very?) complex. However, its major assumptions are straightforward. The initial construc- tion of many propositions involves relatively inefficient processes with many irrelevant propositions being included. At this stage, context pro- vided by the overall theme of the text is ignored. After that, the integration process uses contextual information from the text to weed out irrelevant propositions. What is the relationship between schemas (as proposed by Bartlett, 1932) and situation models? Schemas are abstract and very general whereas situation models are more specific. However, schemas are often used as the building blocks from which situation models are formed. Figure 10.12 The construction-integration model. Adapted from Kintsch (1992).

Adapted from Kintsch et al. (1990). How does the construction-integration model differ from schema theory? Schema theory emphasises top-down processes in discourse com- prehension and memory. This differs substantially from the construction- integration model: “During the construction phase, the text input launches a dumb bottom-up process in the reader’s knowledge base . . . top-down factors, such as reading perspective or reading goal, exert their influence at the integration phase” (Kaakinen & Hyönä, 2007, p. 1323). Findings Kintsch et al. (1990) tested the assumption that text processing produces three levels of representation. Participants read brief descriptions of various situations and their recognition memory was tested immediately or at times ranging up to four days later. As predicted, forgetting was fastest for the least complete representation (i.e., the surface representation) and there was no forgetting for the most complete representation (i.e., the situation model). More evidence for the existence of three levels of representation was reported by Karlsson et al. (2018). They asked children aged 9 to 11 to think aloud while reading texts. Some children (literal readers) stayed close to the text and produced a surface level understanding. Other children (paraphrasing readers) focused on the meaning of the text and produced a textbase understanding. Finally, some children (elaborating readers) made use of background knowledge and produced a situation model of the text. As predicted, comprehension ability was greatest in elaborating readers and least in literal readers. Nguyen and McDaniel (2016) increased the extent to which some readers formed a situation model from a text by given them instructions to reduce gaps in their situation model. Readers given those instructions had higher comprehension levels than those not given them. Another prediction is that readers should often find it hard to discrim- inate between text information and inferences drawn from the text. As we saw earlier, that prediction has received much support.

In their study, participants read a text discussing four rare diseases. They were asked to assume a close friend had been diagnosed with one of them and they had to inform the friends they had in common about that disease. These instructions influenced the construction stage of comprehension – readers focused primarily on sentences relating to their friend’s disease. According to the model, text information is linked with general world or semantic knowledge before contextual information from the rest of the text. Cook and Myers (2004) tested this assumption using various passages. Here is an excerpt from one passage: The movie was a small independent film with a low budget and small staff, so everyone involved had to take on extra jobs and responsibilities. On the first day of filming “Action!” was called by the actress so that shooting could begin . . . The model predicts that readers’ knowledge that actresses do not direct films should have caused them to fixate the word actress for a long time. In fact, however, that word was not fixated for long because readers immedi- ately used the contextual justification for someone other than the director being in charge (in italics). Thus, in opposition to the model, contextual information can be accessed before general world knowledge. The precise processes involved in integration and leading to a situation model are not spelled out within the model. However, it is probable that various executive functions (see Glossary) are involved such as inhibitory processes (suppressing irrelevant propositions), attention shifting (cogni- tive flexibility), updating information in working memory, and planning. Follmer (2018) reported in a meta-analysis that individuals high in each of these executive functions had superior comprehension ability to those low in these functions. Evaluation The key notion that propositions for the text representation are selected by spreading activation operating on propositions drawn from the text and stored knowledge is plausible and consistent with most of the evi- dence. There is also reasonable evidence for the model’s three levels of representation. The model predicts accurately that readers often find it hard to discriminate between text information and related inferences. The model has influenced the development of several subsequent theories (especially the RI-Val model below). What are the model’s limitations? (1) The model is less applicable when texts are easy to process (McNamara & Magliano, 2009). With easy texts, there is often no need to generate a situation model. (2) The assumption that only bottom-up processes are used during the construction phase of text processing is dubious.

(3) It is assumed only general world and semantic knowledge is used in addition to text information during the construction phase. In fact, other sources of information (e.g., context) can also be used during this phase (e.g., Cook & Myers, 2004). (4) The model is oversimplified. For example, O’Brien and Cook (2016) argued persuasively that language comprehension involves a valida- tion stage continuing after the completion of the integration stage (see below). (5) The cognitive processes involved in the integration stage of text com- prehension are not specified clearly in the model. As we have seen, inhibitory processes, attention shifting, updating and planning are all involved (Follmer, 2018). (6) The model accounts for the relatively “automatic” inferences drawn during reading but not more effortful ones (Reichle, 2015). (7) Individual differences (e.g., in working memory capacity) are de-emphasised. (8) There is an exaggerated emphasis on the role played by abstract propositions in forming situation models. More recent theories (e.g., the event-indexing model discussed shortly) assume situation models include more concrete information (e.g., perceptual details). RI-Val model O’Brien and Cook (2016) developed Kintsch’s construction- integration model. Their model assumes there are three stages in language comprehension: (1) The activation or resonance (R) stage: there is a “dumb and unre- stricted process” (p. 329) in which any discourse-relevant infor- mation in long-term memory can be activated and influence initial comprehension. (2) The integration (I) stage: activated concepts are linked to (or inte- grated with) the contents of working memory. Integration is based on conceptual overlap, making it possible that it results in “the con- nection of related, but contradictory pieces of information” (Williams et al., 2018, p. 1415). (3) The validation (Val) stage: linkages formed during the integration stage are validated against relevant information (e.g., general knowl- edge) stored in long-term memory. O’Brien and Cook’s (2016) RI-Val model is shown in Figure 10.14. The three processing stages overlap in time but start in the order described above. It is assumed all three processes are passive (i.e., relatively auto- matic) and always continue to completion. At some point in processing, the reader (or listener) decides on the basis of the validation process that they have an adequate comprehension of the discourse: the coherence threshold has been reached.

Note that these processes continue even after the coherence threshold has been reached. From O’Brien and Cook (2016). How does the RI-Val model compare with Kintsch’s construction- integration model? The two models are broadly similar: the resonance and integration states resemble the construction stage in Kintsch’s model. However, there are two important differences: (1) The RI-Val model explicitly identifies separate integration and val- idation processes whereas validation is only implicitly incorporated within the construction-integration model. (2) In contrast to other models, it is assumed within the RI-Val model that the validation process often continues even after the readers (or listeners) have understood the discourse (see Figure 10.14). As a con- sequence, they may detect an inconsistency in what they are reading or hearing after reaching the coherence threshold. Cook and O’Brien (2014) obtained support for the above prediction. Participants read a passage about Mary who had been a strict vegetarian for many years. The crucial (target) sentence in the passage was either, Mary decided to order a cheeseburger, or, Mary decided to order a tuna salad. The pattern of eye movements indicated that participants rapidly detected the inconsistency between Mary being a vegetarian and ordering a cheeseburger. However, the inconsistency is less obvious when Mary orders a tuna salad. With that inconsistency, it was only on the sentence following the target one that the participants’ eye movements were disrupted. Williams et al. (2018) obtained similar findings. Readers often detected that sentences such as, Moses brought two animals of each kind on the ark, were incorrect when reading the sentence following the incorrect one. In sum, it makes sense to divide Kintsch’s integration stage into somewhat separate integration and validation stages.

Second, the model focuses too much on passive or automatic processes and has very little to say about active stra- tegic processes (discussed later). Event-indexing model and event-segmentation theory Kintsch’s construction-integration model is a leading example of a situa- tion model. As Zwaan (2016, p. 1028) pointed out, “The basic idea behind situation models is that comprehension of a stretch of discourse involves the construction of the state of affairs denoted by the text rather than only a mental representation of the text itself.” In this section, we consider two more situation models representing developments of Kintsch’s approach. The theoretical discussed here both emphasise the importance of events. According to Radvansky and Zacks (2011, p. 608), “Events are fundamental to human experience. They [are] the elements that constitute the stream of experience.” One theoretical approach we will discuss is the event-indexing model (Zwaan et al., 1995). The other is event-segmentation theory (Zacks et al., 2007) which represents a development and extension of the event- indexing model. They are both situation models, but they differ from Kintsch’s model in the nature of the representations formed during discourse com- prehension. He argued that mental models consist of abstract propositions. In contrast, the event-indexing and event-segmentation theories assume rep- resentations are often grounded in perception and action (Zwaan, 2014). Zwaan (2016, p. 1029) used the sentence “The egg is in the carton” to illustrate the difference between these theoretical approaches. A con- crete representation of the sentence might include the shape of a whole egg whereas an abstract representation would not. The event-indexing model (Zwaan et al., 1995) focuses on comprehen- sion processes when someone reads a narrative text (e.g., a story or novel). Thus, its scope differs from that of the construction-integration model where the emphasis is on comprehension of expository texts designed to describe and/or inform. However, there are some similarities (e.g., the emphasis on constructing situation models during reading). As McNamara and Magliano (2009, p. 321) pointed out, a fundamen- tal assumption of the event-indexing model is that “The cognitive system is more attuned to perceive dynamic events (changes in states) rather than static information”. According to the event-indexing model, readers monitor five situational aspects to decide whether their situation model requires updating: (1) protagonist: the central character or actor in the present event com- pared to the previous one; (2) temporality: the relationship between the times at which the present and previous events occurred; (3) causality: the causal relationship of the current event to the previous one; (4) spatiality: the relationship between the spatial setting of the current and previous events; Interactive exercise: Construction-integration model Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["threshold Degree of infuence on comprehension Resonance Integration Validation Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","Language comprehension 507 the three major processes involved in language comprehension and on setting the coherence threshold."]}

What happens to outdated information when we update a situation model? There are two possibilities (Zwaan & Madden, 2004). First, such informa- tion continues to influence the comprehension process (resonance view). Second, outdated information is mostly or totally discarded in favour of new information in the text (here-and-now view). According to event-segmentation theory (Zacks et al., 2007), updating of a situation model can take two main forms: (1) incremental updating of individual situational dimensions (the “brick- by-brick” approach emphasised with the event-indexing model); (2) global updating in which the current situational model is replaced by a new one (the “from scratch” approach emphasised by event- segmentation theory); such updating is most likely to occur when we reach the boundary between one event and the next. When do readers engage in global updating? It is assumed we try to predict the near future when reading a text or observing a scene. Such predictions become harder to make as we approach the boundary between one event and the next, which can trigger construction of a new model. Findings According to the event-indexing model, updating is effortful and incurs a processing load. As predicted, Swets and Kurby (2016) found reading time (indexed by eye movements) was greater when updating was required at the boundary between the end of one event and the start of the next. If each aspect of the situation model is processed independently or separately, we would predict updating time to be greater when two aspects require updat- ing rather than only one. Curiel and Radvansky (2014) obtained the pre- dicted finding. The probability of updating occurring varies across the situational aspects. Readers generally update information on intentionality, time and protagonist, but are less likely to do so with spatial information (Smith & O’Brien, 2012). Most research has involved only short texts. McNerney et al. (2011) studied reading times while participants read a novel. In contrast to find- ings with short texts, reading times were reduced when spatial or tem poral information required updating. Perhaps readers’ engagement with the novel facilitated the task of updating such information. As discussed earlier, the theoretical approach discussed here assumes situation models often contain concrete perceptual and/or motor infor- mation. As Kaup et al. (2007, p. 978) argued, “Comprehension is tied to the creation of representations . . . similar in nature to the representations created when directly experiencing or re-experiencing the respective situa- tions and events.” Evidence supporting the above theoretical assumption has been obtained using the sentence-picture verification task.

They were then presented with a picture and decided rapidly whether the object in the picture had been mentioned in the preceding sentence. Verification times were faster when the object’s shape in the picture (e.g., an eagle with out- stretched or folded wings) matched the shape implied in the sentence indi- cating readers’ use of perceptual information. Zwaan and Pecher (2012) also used the sentence–picture verification task in several experiments. Verification times were faster to pictures matching the implied orientation, shape or colour of sentence objects than to non-matching pictures. Moore and Schwitgebel (2018) reported evidence consistent with the above assumptions and research. Participants read various kinds of text (e.g., stage dialogue; poems; descriptive text). When they heard a beep, they indicated whether they had just been engaged in visual imagery. Across the different kinds of text, readers reported visual imagery 70% of the time. Is it cognitively demanding for readers to create detailed visual sim- ulations of objects referred to in texts? Gao and Jiang (2018) increased processing demands by presenting text in a hard-to-read font. However, this did not impair readers’ ability to infer the physical shapes of objects referred to in texts. The implication is that relatively little processing capacity is required for readers to create visual simulations while compre- hending texts. Does outdated information disrupt current text processing and forma- tion of a situation model? Kendeou et al. (2013) argued it would be disad- vantageous if outdated information was always disrupting. They discovered the provision of causal explanations supporting the updating process elim- inated disruption. One story involved Mary, who had been a vegetarian for 10 years. This sentence was presented late in the story: Mary ordered a cheeseburger and fries. There was no disruption from outdated information for readers giving a causal explanation why Mary was no longer vegetarian (she had insufficient vitamins and so her doctor told her to eat meat). Is situation-model updating incremental (as claimed within the event- indexing model) or global (as claimed within event-segmentation theory)? Kurby and Zacks (2012) asked readers to think aloud while reading an extended narrative. They showed incremental updating by increased men- tions of the character, object, space, time and goal when the relevant situa- tional aspect changed. They also showed global updating – the presence of an event boundary was associated with increased mentions of the charac- ter, cause, goal, and time. Huff et al. (2018) found that updating was also incremental when listeners were presented with an audio drama. Evaluation The greatest strength of the event-indexing model and event- segmentation theory is that they identify key aspects of situation models that were de-emphasised within other theoretical approaches. For example, they focus on gradual and global updating of situation models in response to changes within and between events.

What are the limitations of this theoretical approach? First, it is fully applicable only to narrative texts describing event sequences and is of little relevance to expository texts providing information and/or explanations. Even with narrative texts, situation models are less likely to be formed when the text is complicated. For example, most readers failed to form a situation model when reading a complex account of a murder scene (Zwaan & van Oostendorp, 1993). Second, the theoretical approach de-emphasises important deter- minants of comprehension (e.g., the reader’s goals and reading skills; McNamara & Magliano, 2009). Reasonable reading skills and adequate motivation for successful monitoring the five different dimensions of pro- tagonist, temporality, causality, spatial relationships and intentionality. Third, relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms leading text comprehension to produce representations containing percep- tual and/or motor information (Dijkstra & Post, 2015). We also lack a detailed understanding of how such concrete information and the abstract propositional information emphasised by Kintsch are combined during text comprehension. Fourth, most research has involved relatively short texts. However, preliminary evidence suggests some comprehension processes may differ between long and short texts (McNerney et al., 2011). CHAPTER SUMMARY • Parsing: overview. Listeners often make use of prosodic cues (e.g. pauses) provided by the speaker to interpret sentences (especially ambiguous ones). There is much evidence readers use their “inner voice” to produce implicit prosody that closely resembles the prosody found in spoken sentences. Readers’ use of implicit prosody is greatly aided by the presence of commas in text. • Theoretical approaches: parsing and prediction. The garden- path model is a two-stage model where only syntactic information is used at the first stage. In fact, various kinds of non-syntactic information are sometimes used earlier in sentence processing than the model predicts. The model erroneously predicts that most readers will ultimately generate a correct syntactic structure even for complex sentences. According to the constraint-based model, all sources of information (e.g., context) are available immediately to someone processing a sentence. Competing sentence analyses are activated in parallel, with several language characteristics (e.g., verb bias) being used to resolve ambiguities. There is much support for this model. However, its predictions are sometimes imprecise.

If this structure is disconfirmed, there is extensive re-analysis. This model de-emphasises the importance of task demands in influencing parsing. According to the good-enough language processing account, we often process sentences rather superficially using various heuristics and so are prone to error. It is not clear how readers decide a proposed sentence structure is good enough. ERP studies indicate several sources of information (including word meanings and context) influence sentence processing at an early stage. Top-down processes generate predictions as to what will be read next. • Pragmatics. Pragmatics is concerned with intended rather than literal meanings. Understanding figurative language (e.g., metaphor; irony) is often relatively complex because it involves simultaneous processing of metaphorical and literal meanings. Understanding metaphors involves selecting predicate features relevant to the argument and inhibiting irrelevant predicate features. There are processing differences between different types of metaphors and between novel and familiar metaphors. Listeners generally understand better what speakers are saying if they make use of the common ground (shared knowledge and beliefs). When it is effortful to use the common ground, listeners often rely on the egocentric heuristic. Sometimes listeners make simultaneous use of an egocentric perspective and common ground. • Individual differences: working memory capacity. Individuals high in working memory capacity outperform low-capacity individuals with respect to language comprehension. This superiority depends on both specific individual differences (e.g., verbal working memory) and more general ones. It has generally been assumed theoretically that there is a direct relationship between working memory capacity and reading comprehension. However, there is increasing evidence that the relationship is indirect and depends on factors such as vocabulary size, language experience and general reasoning ability. • Discourse processing: inferences. Readers typically make logical and bridging inferences (e.g., anaphor resolution) but the extent to which they make elaborative inferences is variable. Inference drawing depends on two types of processes: (1) passive or “automatic” processes; (2) effortful reader-initiated processes. Reader-initiated processes are most likely to be used when required for readers to attain adequate comprehension and coherence while reading a text. Anaphor resolution is a very common form of bridging inference. It involves multiple constraints operating interactively in parallel.

However, there is evidence that anxious individuals are more likely than non-anxious ones to draw threatening predictive inferences. • Discourse comprehension: theoretical approaches. According to schema theory, schemas or organised packets of knowledge influence our comprehension of (and memory for) discourse in a top-down fashion. The theory lacks explanatory power, and comprehension and memory are less error-prone than assumed theoretically. According to Kintsch’s construction-integration model, three levels of text representation are constructed. It is assumed bottom-up processes (construction stage) are followed by top-down processes (integration stage). However, top-down processes occur earlier than assumed theoretically. The model is less applicable when texts are easily processed. According to the RI-Val model (a development of the construction-integration model), a long-lasting validation process can detect inconsistencies in a text even after readers believe they have adequate text comprehension. The event-indexing model and event-segmentation theory focus on how readers update their situation models in response to changes within and between events. This general approach works well with simple narrative texts but is less applicable to complex and/or expository texts. The approach de-emphasises the role played by the reader’s goals and reading skills. FURTHER READING Carreiras, M., Armstrong, B.C. & Duñabeitia, J.A. (2018). Reading. In S.L.

We can easily control material to be comprehended, but it is harder to constrain an individual’s language production. In addi- tion, to account for language production, we need more than simply a theory of language. Language production is basically a goal-directed activ- ity having communication as its main goal. People speak and write to impart information, to be friendly and so on. Thus, motivational and social factors must be considered in addition to purely linguistic ones. This chapter focuses on speech production and writing (including the effects of brain damage on these language processes). More is known about speech production than about writing and nearly everyone spends more time talking than writing. Thus, it is more important to understand the processes involved in talking. Nevertheless, writing is an important skill. How similar are the processes involved in spoken and written lan- guage? Both have as their central function the communication of informa- tion about the writer or speaker, other people and the world. In addition, both depend on the same knowledge base. However, children (and nearly all adults) find writing much harder than speaking which suggests there are important differences between them. The main similarities and differences are discussed below. Similarities The view that speaking and writing are similar receives support from theo- retical approaches to these language activities. For example, it is assumed both start with planning, in order to decide on the overall meaning to be communicated (e.g., Dell et al., 1997, on speech production; Hayes, 2012, on writing). At this stage, the actual words to be spoken or written are not considered. The planning stage is followed by language production (often on a clause-by-clause basis). Miozzo et al. (2018) identified several other similarities. First, chil- dren typically only learn how to write after they have developed good spoken-language skills. Second, the teaching of writing often focuses on Chapter 11 Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["truction- integration model; event-indexing model; event-segmentation theory).","Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

Third, adults’ word spellings are influenced to some extent by word pronunciation. Some forms of written communication closely resemble spoken forms. For example, consider instant messaging involving a rapid exchange of typed messages. Choe (2018) studied five Korean friends exchanging instant messages. The messages were mostly typed in a spontaneous and informal fashion resembling casual speech. Those receiving these messages often replied with simplified messages (e.g. yeah) or indicated their involve- ment by responding with “machine-gun” questions (produced very rapidly without hesitation). In sum, the exchanges of typed messages were very similar to spoken conversation. Differences There are several important differences between speaking and writing. Written language typically uses longer and more complex constructions as well as longer words and a larger vocabulary. Writers make more use than speakers of words or phrases signalling what comes next (e.g., but; on the other hand). This helps to compensate for the fact that there is a rela- tive lack of prosody (rhythm; intonation, and so on; discussed shortly) in writing compared to speech. Here are five major differences between speaking and writing (Crystal, 2005): (1) Speech is time-bound and transient whereas writing is space-bound and permanent. (2) Speakers typically have much less time available for planning than writers and so spoken sentences are typically shorter. (3) Speakers mostly receive immediate verbal and non-verbal feedback (e.g., expressions of bewilderment) from their listeners. (4) Speech is well suited to social functions (e.g., casual chatting), whereas writing is well suited to communicating facts and ideas. (5) Writers have direct access to what they have produced so far whereas speakers do not. What are the consequences of the above differences? Speech is often infor- mal and simple in structure whereas writing is more formal and complex. Writers need to write clearly because they do not receive immediate feedback. Some brain-damaged patients have largely intact writing skills despite an almost total inability to speak and a lack of inner speech (e.g., EB, studied by Levine et al., 1982). Other brain-damaged patients can speak fluently but find writing very hard (Ellis & Young, 1988). Rapp et al. (2015) studied patients following a left-hemisphere stroke. Aspects of grammar were impaired in writing but not speech for some patients whereas others showed the opposite pattern. These findings suggest partial independence of the processes underlying writing and speech. However, the higher-level processes of language production (e.g., planning; use of knowledge) are probably very similar in speech and writing.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\n516 Language We must not exaggerate the differences between speech and writing. As Crystal (2005, p. 8) noted, “There are few . . . absolute differences between speech and writing, and there is no single parameter of linguistic variation which can distinguish all spoken from all written genres.” For example, emails often contain features associated with speech (e.g., infor- mality; rapid feedback). BASIC ASPECTS OF SPEECH PRODUCTION We start by introducing broad issues of direct relevance to speech pro- duction. First, there is the important (but complex) issue of the extent to which speech production utilises processes involved in speech compre- hension. Second, we argue speech production is much harder than it may appear subjectively. Strategies used by speakers to cope with the complex- ities of speech production are discussed. Third, we provide a preliminary account of the notion that speech production involves a series of process- ing stages. Speech production vs speech comprehension We saw in Chapter 9 that speech perception (especially under difficult lis- tening conditions) often involves brain regions associated with speech pro- duction (e.g., Adank, 2012). In similar fashion, it is increasingly argued that speech production often involves processes and brain regions asso- ciated with speech perception. For example, Chater et al. (2016, p. 244) argued that “Language comprehension and production are facets of a unitary skill”. They discussed their computational model (the Chunk- Based Learner) which simulates aspects of children’s language acquisition and is equally applicable to production and comprehension (see discussion later). Strong evidence that speech production involves processes overlap- ping with those used in speech perception was reported by Silbert et al. (2014). They identified the brain areas activated as speakers produced a 15-minute narrative, and also those activated as listeners comprehended the same narrative. They argued there are two possible reasons why a given brain area is activated during both speech comprehension and production: (1) The same processes are occurring in both cases. (2) Different processes occur in comprehension and production within the same brain area. In their analyses, they assumed (1) was the case only when there were similar patterns over time during comprehension and production: they called this comprehension-production coupling. Silbert et al.’s (2014) findings are shown in Figure 11.1. Several brain areas exhibited comprehension-production coupling (in blue). Thus, speech production shares several processes with speech comprehension. Unsurprisingly, other brain areas were specifically associated with speech comprehension or speech production.

From Silbert et al. (2014). overall suggested high-level language processing is more likely than low- level processing to be shared between comprehension and production. Pickering and Gambi (2018, p. 1002) focused on the use of speech- production processes in speech comprehension: “[Comprehenders] cov- ertly imitate the linguistic form of the speaker’s utterance and construct a representation of the underlying communicative intention . . . [they] run this intention through their own production system to prepare the pre- dicted utterance.” This hypothesis has much support (see Chapter 10). For example, the average gap between turns during a conversation between two individuals is only 250 ms (Stivers et al., 2009) even though it takes about 600 ms to produce a single word (Pickering & Gambi, 2018). How easy is speech production? On the face of it (by the sound of it?), speech production seems straight- forward. Indeed, it seems almost effortless when we chat with friends and acquaintances. We typically speak at 2–3 words per second or about 150 words a minute and this rapid speech rate suggests that speaking requires relatively few processing resources. The reality of speech production is very different from what is implied above. Consider Christiansen and Chater’s (2016) theoreti- cal approach (discussed in Chapter 10 and in more detail later, p. 535). According to this approach, our short-term memory has very limited capacity and new information rapidly eliminates old information. As a result, “Once detailed [language] production information has been assem- bled, it must be executed straight away, before it is obliterated by the on-coming stream of later low-level decisions” (Christiansen & Chater, 2016, p. 5). Evidence speech production is often more cognitively demanding than speech comprehension was reported by Boiteau et al. (2014). Participants tracked a moving target while engaged in speech production or comprehen- sion. Speech production (especially speech planning) was associated with a greater impairment of tracking performance than speech comprehension.

One way is by re-using aspects of what they have just heard. An important example is syntactic priming in which speakers re-use a given syntactic structure. If, for example, you have just heard a passive sentence (e.g., “The man was bitten by the dog”), this increases the probability you will produce a passive sentence. Convincing evidence for syntactic priming was reported in a meta-analysis (see Glossary) by Mahowald et al. (2016). This priming effect was especially strong when speakers used the same (or similar) words to those they had heard. Another way speakers reduce processing demands is via preformulation, which involves producing phrases used before. Approximately 70% of our speech consists of word combinations we use repeatedly (Altenberg, 1990; Liu, 2014). Horseracing commentators (who speak very rapidly) make extensive use of preformulations (e.g., “They are off and racing now”). Another strategy used to facilitate speech production is underspecification, which involves using simplified expressions where the full meaning is not explicit. Underspecification and preformulation often go together. “Or something” and “and things like that” are examples. KEY TERMS Syntactic priming The tendency for a speaker’s utterances to have the same syntactic structure as those they have heard shortly beforehand. Preformulation The production by speakers of phrases used frequently before; it reduces the demands of speech production Underspecification A strategy used to reduce processing costs in speech production by using simplified expressions. IN THE REAL WORLD: MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT It is cognitively demanding to produce coherent spontaneous speech. Unsurprisingly, patients with Alzheimer’s disease exhibit clear signs of impaired spontaneous speech. Alzheimer’s disease is often preceded by mild cognitive impairment, a condition involving minor problems with memory and thinking. Here we consider which aspects of speech production are impaired in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Berisha et al. (2015) compared the press conferences of two American presidents: Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush. Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease six years after leaving office. He showed a substantial reduction in the use of unique words during his time as president, coupled with a large increase in conversational fillers (e.g., “well”; “um”; “ah”) and non-specific nouns (e.g., “something”; “anything”). Thus, his speech became simpler and less informative due to mild cognitive impairment. In contrast, President Bush showed no systematic changes in vocabulary use over time. Mueller et al. (2018) studied individuals with early mild cognitive impairment (subtle cognitive deficits not meeting the criteria for mild cognitive impairment). Over a two-year period, these individuals showed greater decline than cognitively healthy controls in two aspects of speech: (1) fluency (e.g., few filled pauses; few false starts); (2) semantic content (proportion of words provid- ing meaningful content). These findings resemble those found with President Reagan. In sum, reductions in speech-production quality are found even during the early stages of mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that “normal” quality of speech production requires intact cog- nitive processes. Such findings also suggest that speech-production deficits may serve as an “early warning” of future, more severe, cognitive impairment. Of relevance, Berisha et al. (2017) found professional American football players had lower spoken language complexity (e.g., low ratio of content words (e.g., nouns; verbs) to total words spoken) than controls. In addition, those football players who had been tackled the most had the lowest spoken language complexity. It might be a useful precaution to carry out more detailed cognitive testing on those American football players with the least spoken language complexity.

Dell (1986), in his spreading-activation theory (discussed later, pp. 526–530), argued speech production consists of four levels: ● semantic level: the meaning of what is to be said (or the message to be communicated); this is the planning level; ● syntactic level: the grammatical structure of the words in the planned utterance; ● morphological level: the morphemes (basic units of meaning); ● phonological level: the phonemes (basic units of sound). It makes sense to assume the above four levels or stages occur in the order described. Thus, we engage in planning, followed by working out the gram- matical structure of the sentence and the basic units of meaning, and finally work out the sounds to be produced. In fact, speech production is much less neat and tidy: “later” processes can occur at the same time as (or even ahead of) “earlier” processes. SPEECH PLANNING We typically plan what we are going to say before speaking (the first stage in speech production). In other words, we engage our brain before speaking. Is speech planning influenced by the syntactic structure of planned utterances? Supporting evidence was reported by Lee et al. (2013). Consider the following sentence: The student of the teacher who is raising her hand. This sentence is ambiguous. Is the person raising their hand the teacher (simpler syntactic structure) or the student (more complex structure). The time to initiate speech was longer when speakers produced the more complex syntactic structure indicating that speech planning included aspects of syntactic structure. What is the scope of speakers’ planning? Planning might occur at the level of the clause (a part of a sentence containing a subject and a verb). Alternatively, it might occur at the level of the phrase (a group of words expressing a single idea). In the sentence “Failing the exam was a major disappointment to him”, the first three words form a phrase. Holmes (1988) found speakers talking spontaneously about various topics had hesitations and pauses immediately before the start of a clause. This suggests they were planning the forthcoming clause. Martin et al. (2004) found speakers describing moving pictures took longer to initiate speech when the initial phrase was complex rather than simple. This sug- gests they planned the initial phrase before speaking. The extent of advance speech planning often differs at the semantic, syntactic and phonological levels. Garrett (1980) analysed various types of speech errors (discussed further later, pp. 521–523). Word-exchange errors (e.g., “My chair seems empty without my room”) often involved KEY TERMS Alzheimer’s disease A disease in which general deterioration of the brain leads to progressive mental deterioration.

These errors occur during grammatical encoding. In contrast, sound-exchange errors (e.g., burst of beaden instead of beast of burden) typically involved nearby elements within a phrase. These errors occur during phonological encoding. Garrett concluded that gram- matical or syntactic planning occurs over greater distances within a sen- tence than does phonological planning. Recent research reveals a more complex picture. In a review, Klaus et al. (2017) concluded planning at the syntactic and phonological levels can both extend “beyond the initial phrase and may even span over a whole simple sentence” (p. 813). In their own research, Klaus et al. found advance planning was comparable at the syntactic and phonological levels when speakers performed a visuo-spatial task at the same time. However, performing a verbal task (remembering digits) at the same time only reduced the extent of phonological planning, suggesting the verbal task and phonological planning required the same processing resources. More generally, the findings suggest that the scope of planning at any given level (e.g., syntactic; phonological) depends on the precise demands of any non- task processing occurring at the same time. Flexibility How can we account for the variable findings discussed above? Speakers generally want to start communicating rapidly (implying little forward plan- ning). However, they also want to talk fluently (implying much forward planning). Speakers resolve conflict flexibly depending on their immediate goals and the situational demands. Ferreira and Swets (2002) reported evidence that speakers’ planning varies flexibly. Speakers answered mathematical problems. When there was no time pressure, speakers planned their responses before starting to speak and so the time taken to start speaking was influenced by task dif- ficulty. When there was time pressure, speakers engaged in limited plan- ning before starting to speak, with additional planning occurring during speaking. Thus, they did as much forward planning as was feasible before speaking. Wagner et al. (2010) agreed speech planning is flexible and identified several factors influencing advance planning. First, individuals speaking slowly engaged in more planning than fast speakers. Second, there was more planning before speakers produced simple rather than complex sen- tences. Third, speakers showed more planning when under low (rather than high) cognitive load. How can we explain speakers’ flexible advance planning? As men- tioned earlier, they face a trade-off between communicating effectively and avoiding errors on the one hand and cognitive demands on the other hand. If they focus on avoiding errors, the cognitive demands are substan- tial. However, if they try to minimise cognitive demands, their speech will contain many errors. In practice, speakers mostly engage in extensive plan- ning only when it is relatively undemanding. In sum, “Speech planning processes flexibly adapt to external task goals” (Swets et al., 2013, p. 23).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nLanguage production 521 There is a final important point. Since speakers’ advance planning is generally limited in scope, it would seem that they must often engage in incremental planning. In other words, speakers plan only part of the next sentence or utterance and gradually extend and change their plan over time. Brown-Schmidt and Konopka (2015) obtained evidence of incremen- tal planning when participants were required to add new information to their spoken utterance after they had started to speak. Brown-Schmidt and Konopka also found that speakers’ fluency was not impaired by adding new information, suggesting that their initial plan was so flexible it could easily accommodate message revisions. SPEECH ERRORS Our speech is generally accurate and coherent. However, we all make occa- sional speech errors. There are several kinds of speech errors which can occur at any stage of speech production. Human limitations in process- ing capacity (e.g., short-term memory) might suggest speech errors would be frequent (Christiansen & Chater, 2016). However, the average person makes a speech error only once every 500 sentences. In spite of their rarity, speech errors are important because they provide insights into the mechanisms underlying speech production. This would not be so if speech errors were random and thus unpredictable. In fact, speech errors are predominantly systematic. The speech errors even of brain-damaged patients are generally similar to the correct words (Dell et al., 2014). As Dell et al. concluded, “Slips [speech errors] are more right than wrong.” Historically, speech errors were typically written down by researchers immediately after being heard. This is limited because many speech errors are undetected (Ferber, 1995). More recently, research has focused on speech errors produced deliberately under laboratory conditions. Error types There are several types of error additional to those mentioned earlier. One example is the spoonerism which occurs when the initial letter(s) of two words are switched. It was named after the Reverend William Spooner who is credited with several memorable examples (e.g., “You have hissed all my mystery lectures”). Alas, most of his gems resulted from painstaking effort. The Freudian slip is a famous type of error allegedly revealing the speaker’s true sexual desires. In a study by Motley (1980), male partici- pants said out loud pairs of items such as goxi furl and bine foddy. For some participants, the experimenter was a female who was “attractive, per- sonable, very provocatively attired, and seductive in behaviour” (Motley, 1980, p. 140). More spoonerisms (e.g., goxi furl turning into foxy girl) were produced when the participants’ passions were inflamed by this female experimenter. Semantic substitution errors occur when the correct word is replaced by one of similar meaning (e.g., “Where is my tennis bat?” instead of “Where is my tennis racquet?”). In 99% of cases, the substituted and correct words belong to the same part of speech (e.g., nouns), suggesting speakers plan KEY TERMS Spoonerism A speech error in which the initial letter or letters of two words (typically close together) are switched to form two different words.

Morpheme-exchange errors involve inflections or suffixes (e.g., -ed) being attached to the wrong word (e.g., “He has already trunked two packs”). Such errors imply that the positioning of inflections is dealt with by a different process from the one responsible for positioning word stems (e.g., trunk; pack). The word stems are worked out before the inflections are added because the spoken inflections or suffixes are generally altered to fit with the new word stems. For example, the “s” sound in “the forks of a prong” is pronounced in a way appropriate within the word forks but not the original word prongs. Finally, we consider subject-verb agreement errors, in which sin- gular verbs are mistakenly used with plural subjects or vice versa (e.g., “The government have made a mess of things”). Why do we make such errors? McDonald (2008) argued that considerable processing resources are required to avoid subject-verb agreement errors. As predicted, speak- ers made more such errors when there was an externally imposed load on working memory. Other factors associated with use of singular or plural verbs have been identified. When speakers had recently encountered phrases (e.g., a trio of violinists) paired with plural verbs, they were more likely to produce plural verbs with other, similar phrases (e.g., a class of children) (Haskell et al., 2010). Mirković and MacDonald (2013) found semantic factors are important. Participants received verbs plus phrases (in Serbian) such as the following: (1) Many wolves . . . (to jump) (2) Several wolves . . . (to jump) In each case, they had to decide whether to say jump or jumps (both gram- matically acceptable in Serbian). Mirković and MacDonald argued that many is more suggestive than several of a single mass or collection. As pre- dicted, speakers used plural verbs less often following phrases containing many rather than several. It has generally been assumed most speech errors involve sound sub- stitutions. Goldrick et al. (2016) showed the limitations of this assump- tion. Speakers said tongue twisters repeatedly. The sounds associated with speech errors varied considerably – some resembled direct substitutions but most did not. This variability occurred because speech errors were due to a combination of two factors: (1) planning processes relating to the targets of articulation; and (2) articulatory processes specifying the motor move- ments required to execute this plan. This study is important because it indi- cates speech errors are multiply determined and so require more complex explanations than those proposed in the past. In sum, speakers make several types of speech errors. We will shortly discuss other types of speech errors within the context of Dell’s (1986) spreading-activation theory, which provides an explanation of most types of speech errors. Before turning to that theory, however, we discuss two prominent theories of how speakers monitor their own speech to prevent (or correct) speech errors. These theories have general importance because Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["A speech error that reveals the speaker’s (often unconscious) sexual desires.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

Perceptual loop theory Speakers often detect and rapidly correct their own speech errors. Levelt (1983) proposed a perceptual loop theory to explain such error detection. According to this theory, speakers detect their own speech errors by moni- toring their utterances and discovering that what they say sometimes differs from what they intended. Of importance, this monitoring occurs at two levels: inner speech and overt speech. With overt speech, speakers make use of auditory feedback. In essence, speakers use the comprehension system to detect their own speech errors in ways resembling those used to detect errors in other peo- ple’s speech. Monitoring of inner speech should typically occur faster than monitoring of overt speech. Strong evidence that monitoring for speech errors occurs at the two stages of inner and overt speech was reported by Nooteboom and Quené (2017). Speakers were given a task designed to produce errors. For example, the word pair BIN DOG was presented visually and had to be spoken aloud. When they had previously been presented with word pairs such as DOVE BALL; DEER BACK; and DIM BOMB, they sometimes incorrectly said DIN BOG. Nooteboom and Quené recorded two meas- ures: (1) error-to-cut-off times (time between an error and the speaker stop- ping speaking); and (2) error-to-repair times (time between an error and the speaker correcting it). What did Nooteboom and Quené (2017) find? First, the error-to-cut- off times showed two peaks (139 ms and 637 ms). The fast times reflect monitoring of inner speech whereas the slow times reflect monitoring of overt speech. Second, the error-to-repair times also showed two peaks (253 ms and 970 ms): repairing or correcting an error was more time-consuming when detected in overt speech rather than inner speech. It is assumed within perceptual loop theory that speakers often use auditory feedback to monitor their own speech for errors. This assumption has been supported by research showing speakers are worse at detecting errors when auditory masking is used to prevent them from hearing them- selves speak. However, Nooteboom and Quené (2017) discovered that loud masking noise had no effect on the detection of speech errors. Auditory feedback is probably more important in monitoring when speakers produce fairly long and complex utterances than when they simply produce two words as in Nooteboom and Quené’s study. Conflict-based monitoring theory Nozari et al. (2011) proposed a conflict-based monitoring theory. They argued error detection depends on information generated by the speech- production system rather than the comprehension system. Their theory assumes speakers engage in conflict monitoring during competition among various possible words at the time of response selection. Cognitive control mechanisms are used to resolve conflicts between response options.

First, the perceptual loop theory predicts speakers’ success at detecting their own speech errors depends mostly on their comprehension ability. In contrast, Nozari et al.’s (2011) conflict-based account predicts speakers’ ability to detect their speech errors depends on the quality of their speech-production system. Second, speakers should detect errors rapidly if error detection depends on detecting conflict prior to producing an error (the conflict-based account). According to the perceptual loop theory, in contrast, error detec- tion can be fast or slow depending on whether it is based on monitoring inner or overt speech.

(2011) tested patients with aphasia (various language prob- lems; see Glossary) to decide whether their ability to detect their own speech errors depends more on their comprehension or their speech-production ability. There was practically no correlation between comprehension ability and error-detection performance. However, speech-production ability pre- dicted error detection (see Figure 11.2). Patients making many semantic speech errors were much worse than other patients at detecting their own semantic errors (r = –.59). Those making many phonological speech errors were poorer at detecting their own phonological errors (r = –.43). Blackmer and Mitton (1991) assessed speed of error detection among callers to a radio chat show. Many errors were detected very rapidly (e.g., 19% of overt corrections of what a caller had just said occurred immedi- ately). For example, one caller said “willfiddily” and without any pause added “fully”. In the study by Noteboom and Quené (2017) discussed earlier, 72% of the error-to-cut-off times were fast, which is consistent with conflict-based monitoring theory. Gauvin et al. (2016) studied the brain regions associated with error detection in speech production and speech perception. Error detection in speech production generally involved brain regions mostly independent of speech-perception systems. In addition, detection of speech-production errors involved a cognitive control mechanism resolving conflict centred on the anterior cingulate cortex. Overall evaluation There is support for the assumption of perceptual loop theory that speak- ers monitor inner and overt speech. Its further assumption that monitor- ing of overt speech is based on auditory feedback has also received some support. However, auditory feedback is used less often than implied by the theory. Finally, the assumption that speech monitoring involves compre- hension-like processes appears mostly incorrect. Several findings support conflict-based monitoring theory. First, the success of brain-damaged patients in detecting their own speech errors depends largely on their speech-production ability. Second, the finding that speakers often detect speech errors very rapidly suggests speech monitoring occurs within the speech-production system. Third, the brain regions asso- ciated with the detection of speech errors are closer to those predicted by this theory than by perceptual loop theory (Gauvin et al., 2016). However, the theory is limited because it de-emphasises the role sometimes played by speech-perception mechanisms in detecting speech-production errors. THEORIES OF SPEECH PRODUCTION Earlier we mentioned four levels or stages of processing involved in speech production: semantic; syntactic; morphological; and phonological. There is controversy concerning the relationships between these levels or stages of processing in speech production. Two highly influential theories of speech production are Dell’s (1986) spreading-activation theory and Levelt et al.’s Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["s (right).","From Nozari et al."]}

Below we provide a brief preview of key differences between them. According to Dell’s (1986, 2013) spreading-activation theory, process- ing can occur in parallel (at the same time) at different levels (e.g., seman- tic; syntactic). More specifically, it is assumed theoretically that processing is interactive. That means there can be cascade processing (see Glossary) with the initiation of later processing stages occurring prior to the com- pletion of processing at earlier stages. It also means processing can involve bottom-up feedback in addition to the top-down processing characteristic of speech production. In contrast, Levelt et al. (1999) argued serial processing (one process at a time) plays a major role in speech production. They also assumed within their WEAVER++ model that speech production involves a feedforward system with processing occurring in a strictly forward direction (i.e., from meaning to sound). That assumption seems reasonable – it is plausible that speakers decide the meaning they want to communicate before deciding on the appropriate sounds to articulate. In sum, the main assumptions of spreading-activation theory imply speech-production processes are (if not chaotic) then at least very flexible. In contrast, the main assumptions of WEAVER++ imply the processes involved in speech production are regimented and structured. However, the actual theoretical differences are less extreme. Dell (1986) accepted processing at any given point in time is generally more advanced at some levels (e.g., semantic) than others (e.g., phonological). Thus, the notions that initial processing is mainly at the semantic and phonological levels whereas later processing is mostly at the morphological and phonological levels are common to both theories. We will make two final preliminary points about the two theories. First, Goldrick (2006) proposed the compromise position that there is “limited interaction” in speech production. This makes sense – too much interaction would lead to numerous speech errors whereas too little inter- action would inhibit speakers’ ability to produce interesting new sentences and new ideas. Second, spreading-activation theory was initially based largely on evi- dence from speech errors. In contrast, WEAVER++ was based mostly on laboratory studies of the time taken to speak words accurately in different contexts. It is arguable (Goldrick, 2006) that interactive effects are more prevalent in speech-error data than response-time data. Speculatively, the speech-production system may be most efficient when there is minimal distraction and interference and so it operates approximately in line with the assumptions of WEAVER++. Finally, speech production does not depend only on language- specific processes. Some more general processes (e.g., attention; short-term memory) are also important. We discuss relevant theory and research based on this approach at the end of this section (see pp. 535–536). Spreading-activation theory Unsurprisingly, the notion of spreading activation is central to Dell’s (1986) spreading-activation theory. It is assumed the nodes within a KEY TERMS Spreading activation Activation of a node (corresponding to a word or concept) in the brain causes some activation to spread to several related nodes or words.

When a node or word is activated, activation or energy spreads from it to other related nodes or words. For example, strong activation of the node corresponding to “tree” may cause some activation of the node corresponding to “plant”. According to the theory, spreading activation occurs for sounds as well as words. The theory assumes there are categorical rules at the semantic, syn- tactic, morphological and phonological levels of speech production. These rules impose constraints on acceptable categories of items and combina- tions of categories. The rules define categories appropriate at each level. For example, the categorical rules at the syntactic level specify the syntac- tic categories of items within a sentence. There is also a lexicon (dictionary) in the form of a connectionist network. It contains nodes for concepts, words, morphemes and phonemes. When a node is activated, it sends activated to all the nodes connected to it (see Chapter 1). Insertion rules select items for inclusion in the representation of the to-be-spoken sentence according to the following criterion: the most acti- vated node belonging to the appropriate category is selected. For example, if the categorical rules at the syntactic level dictate a verb is required at a given point in the sentence, then the verb whose node is most activated will be selected. After selection, the node’s activation level immediately reduces to zero to prevent it from being selected repeatedly. Dell et al. (2008) focused on why we replace a noun with a noun and a verb with a verb when making speech errors. They argued we possess a “syntactic traffic cop” that monitors what we intend to say and inhibits words outside the appropriate syntactical category. According to the spreading-activation theory, speech errors occur because an incorrect item is sometimes more activated than the correct one. The existence of spreading activation means several nodes are activated at the same time, which increases the likelihood of speech errors. Dell et al. (2014) discuss the processes responsible for the occurrence of several major speech errors (e.g., anticipatory errors; exchange errors). Findings What errors are predicted by spreading-activation theory? First, and of special importance, there is the mixed-error effect, which occurs when an incorrect spoken word is semantically and phonemically related to the correct word. The existence of this effect suggests semantic and phono- logical factors can both influence word selection at the same time – this is consistent with the notion the various levels of processing interact flexibly. Alternatively, a monitoring system may inhibit the production of words phonologically dissimilar to the intended word (Levelt et al., 1999). Convincing evidence for the mixed-error effect was provided by Ferreira and Griffin (2003). Participants read incomplete sentences (e.g., “I thought that there would still be some cookies left, but there were . . .”) followed by picture naming (e.g., of a priest). In this example, participants tended to produce the wrong word none due to the semantic similarity between priest and nun combining with the phonological identity of nun and none.

According to the theory, this effect occurs because it is easier for words than non-words to become activated because they have representations in the lexicon (see Glossary). Alternatively, speakers may monitor their inner speech and edit out non-words (monitor- ing of inner speech was discussed earlier). There is support for both explanations (Dell et al., 2014). Nooteboom and Quené (2008) found evidence for self-monitoring – speakers often cor- rected themselves just before producing an incorrect word (e.g., SAYING D . . . BARN DOOR when seeing BARN-DOOR). Corley et al. (2011) asked people to say tongue twisters rapidly. In one condition, all the stimuli were real words compared to only half in the second condition. There was the typical lexical bias effect in the all-word condition, but the effect disappeared in the second condition. How can we explain these findings? Since half the stimuli in the second condition were non-words, speakers did not edit out non-words before speaking. Third, spreading-activation theory predicts speakers should make anti- cipatory errors in which a speech sound is made too early (e.g., “a Tanadian from Toronto” instead of “a Canadian from Toronto”). This prediction has been confirmed (e.g., Nooteboom & Quené, 2013). Anticipatory errors occur because many sentence words become activated during speech plan- ning and sometimes a later word is more activated than the one that should be spoken. Fourth, many errors should be exchange errors in which two words within a sentence are swapped (e.g., “I must send a wife to my email”). That is, indeed, the case (Nooteboom & Quené, 2013). Remember the acti- vation level of a selected word immediately reduces to zero. If “wife” is selected too early, it is unlikely to be selected in its correct place in the sen- tence. This allows a previously unselected but highly activated word such as “email” to be spoken in the wrong place. Fifth, anticipation and exchange errors generally involve words moving only a relatively short distance within the sentence. Those words relevant to the part of the sentence under current consideration are generally more activated than those relevant to more distant parts of the sentence. Thus, the findings accord with the predictions of spreading-activation theory. Evaluation Spreading-activation theory has several strengths: (1) The mixed-error and lexical bias effects indicate processing during speech production can be highly interactive as predicted theoretically. (2) The theory can also explain several other speech errors (e.g., exchange errors; anticipatory errors). (3) The theory’s emphasis on spreading activation provides links between speech production and other cognitive activities (e.g., word recogni- tion: McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981). (4) Our ability to produce novel sentences may depend in part on the flexibility resulting from widespread activation between processing levels assume by the theory.

(2011; dis- cussed earlier, pp. 523–525) improved the theory by adding mecha- nisms for monitoring and editing out errors early in processing. What are the theory’s limitations? (1) It de-emphasises processes involved in the construction of a message (including its intended meaning). It also fails to consider audience design (how speakers respond to the needs of their audience; dis- cussed later, pp. 544–547). (2) It does not predict the time taken to produce correct and incorrect spoken words. (3) The interactive processes emphasised by the theory are less apparent in error-free than speech-error data (Goldrick, 2006). For example, the processes involved in correct versus incorrect picture naming differ. Principe et al. (2017) found brain activity within large regions of the parietal and temporal cortex differed between correct and incorrect naming within approximately 100 ms of picture presentation. (4) There is insufficient emphasis in the theory on factors influencing the extent of interactive processes in speech production. There is less interactive processing when overall processing demands are high than when they are low (Mädebach et al., 2011; discussed shortly, p. 533). Anticipatory and perseveration errors Dell et al. (1997) developed spreading-activation theory. They argued most speech errors belong to two categories: (1) Anticipatory: as discussed earlier, sounds or words spoken ahead of their time (e.g., “caff of coffee” instead of “cup of coffee”). These errors mainly reflect inexpert planning. (2) Perseveratory: sounds of words are spoken later than they should have been (e.g., “beef needle” instead of “beef noodle”). These errors reflect planning failure or a failure to monitor what one is about to say. Suppose we compare speakers engaging in much forward planning with those doing much less forward planning. According to Dell et al. (1997), those planning ahead should make more anticipatory errors. They focused on the anticipatory proportion (the proportion of total errors [anticipation + perseveration] that is anticipatory) and argued this should correlate positively with speakers’ tendency to plan ahead. Findings Dell et al. (1997) gave speakers extensive practice at saying tongue twisters (e.g., five frantic fat frogs; thirty-three throbbing thumbs). They argued prac- tice would lead to more forward planning and so increase the anticipatory proportion. As predicted, the anticipatory proportion increased from .37 early in practice to .59 at the end of practice.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\n530 Language Dell et al. (1997) also argued that requiring participants to speak more rapidly would reduce forward planning and so decrease the anticipatory proportion. This prediction was supported by Vousden and Maylor (2006) in a study in which children and young adults said tongue twisters slowly or fast. Wutzler et al. (2013) assessed the anticipatory proportion in elderly individuals. Those with cognitive impairment had a significantly lower anticipatory proportion than those without, presumably because they were less able to plan their utterances. Fossett et al. (2016) asked speakers to say tongue twisters at three dif- ferent rates: typical; fast; or faster. The anticipatory proportion was small- est at the typical speaking rate – this is opposite to theoretical prediction. How can we explain the above unexpected finding? Dell et al. (1997) argued the anticipatory proportion will be greatest at a slow speaking rate because it permits much forward planning. This prediction involves the assumption that words later in the sentence remain activated long enough to produce anticipatory errors. If word activation decays rapidly, then the findings of Fossett et al. (2016) can be explained. Levelt’s theoretical approach and WEAVER++ Levelt et al. (1999) put forward a computational model called WEAVER++ (WEAVER stands for Word-form Encoding by Activation and VERification). The model focuses on the processes involved in producing individual spoken words and makes the following assumptions: ● There is a feedforward activation-spreading network meaning that activation proceeds forwards through the network but not backwards. Of particular importance, processing proceeds from meaning to sound. ● There are three main levels within the network: (i) At the highest level are nodes representing lexical concepts. (ii) At the second level are nodes representing lemmas from the mental lexicon. Lemmas are word representations that “are specified syntactically and semantically but not phonologically” (Harley, 2013). Thus, if you know the meaning of a word you are about to say and that is a noun, but you do not know its pronunciation, you have accessed its lemma. (iii) At the lowest level are nodes representing word forms in terms of morphemes (basic units of meaning) and their phonemic segments. ● Lexical (word) selection depends on a competitive process based on the number of lexical units activated. ● Speech production following lexical selection involves various process- ing states following each other in serial fashion (one at a time). ● Speech errors are avoided by means of a checking mechanism based on the speaker monitoring what they say (discussed earlier, see pp. 523–525). It is easy to get lost in the model’s complexities (agreed?). In essence, however, the model shows how word production proceeds from meaning (lexical concepts and lemmas) to sound (e.g., phonological words). There is KEY TERM Lemmas Abstract words possessing syntactic and semantic features but not phonological ones.

A given lemma is generally selected because it is more activated than other lemmas. Then there is morphological encoding during which the basic word form of the selected lemma is activated. This is followed by phonologi- cal encoding – the word’s syllables are computed. What happens is known as lexicalisation, “the process in speech production whereby we turn the thoughts underlying words into sounds” (Harley, 2013). The most important development of Levelt et al.’s (1999) approach involved identifying the brain regions associated with the various processes within the model (Indefrey & Levelt, 2004). This development means neu- roimaging techniques can be used to test the model’s predictions. In sum, WEAVER++ is a discrete, feedforward model. Processing is discrete (separate), because the speech-production system identifies the correct lemma or abstract word before starting to work out the sound of the selected word. It is feedforward, because processing proceeds in a strictly forward (from meaning to sound) direction. Findings According to the model, speakers process syntactic (e.g., a noun’s gender) and phonological information sequentially. Bürki et al. (2016) tested this assumption using event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary). As pre- dicted, the evidence from ERPs suggested syntactic and phonological pro- cessing occurred at different times. Van Turennout et al. (1998) used ERPs with Dutch participants and found syntactic information about a noun’s gender was available 40 ms before its initial phoneme. This is consistent with Levelt’s theoretical approach. Indefrey (2011) carried out a meta-analysis of studies using ERPs and other techniques to assess brain activation during speech production. The right column of Figure 11.3 provides approximate timings for major speech-production processes. Conceptual preparation takes about 200 ms. After that, lemma retrieval takes 75 ms, and phonological code retrieval takes 20 ms per phoneme and 50–55 ms per syllable. Finally, phonetic encoding with articulation typically starts about 600 ms after the initiation of processing. The left-hand side of Figure 11.3 is colour coded to indi- cate the various brain regions in the left hemisphere associated with each process. There are limitations with Indefrey’s (2011) meta-analysis. First, most research involved picture naming meaning the focus of the meta-analysis is narrow. Second, the timings are with respect to stimulus presentation. Since speech production is more concerned with action than perception, it would be preferable to focus on how long a given process occurs prior to speech onset. Third, the neat-and-tidy impression created by Figure 11.3 is mis- leading (see below, p. 532). Recent cognitive neuroscience research relevant to Dell’s and Levelt’s theoretical approaches is discussed in the next section. We can see the distinction between a lemma and the word itself in the tip-of-the-tongue state. The tip-of-the-tongue state occurs when we have a concept or idea in mind (i.e., we have activated the correct lemma or abstract word) but cannot find the appropriate word (i.e., phonological KEY TERMS Lexicalisation The process of translating a word’s meaning into its sound representation during speech production.

Harley and Bown (1998) found the tip-of-the- tongue state was especially frequent for words sounding unlike nearly all other words (e.g., apron; vineyard ) – their unusual phonological forms make them hard to retrieve. Levelt et al. (1999) claimed the lemma includes syntactic as well as semantic information. Accordingly, individuals in the tip-of-the-tongue state should have access to syntactic information. In many languages (e.g., Italian; German), grammatical gender (e.g., masculine; feminine) is part of the syntactic information relating to nouns. As predicted, Italian par- ticipants in the tip-of-the-tongue state for nouns guessed the grammatical gender correctly 85% of the time (Vigliocco et al., 1997). Biedermann et al. (2008) reported less supportive findings. German speakers guessed the grammatical gender and initial phoneme of nouns when in a tip-of-the-tongue state. Theoretically, access to grammatical gender precedes access to phonological information and so participants should have guessed the first phoneme more often when they had access to accurate gender information. However, that was not the case. Resnik et al. (2014) used magneto-encephalography (MEG; see Glossary) while individuals were in the tip-of-the-tongue state when trying Figure 11.3 The right side of the figure indicates the sequence of processes (and their timings) for picture naming.

They predicted brain areas associated with semantic and syntactic processing (i.e., lemma selection) should be activated shortly after picture presentation. In contrast, brain areas associated with motor programming and articulation should be activated shortly before the correct word was produced. The predicted brain areas were activated. However, semantic and motor areas were activated during both time periods suggesting processing was more interactive than assumed within the model. According to WEAVER++, abstract word or lemma selection is com- pleted before phonological information about the word is accessed. In con- trast, Dell’s spreading-activation theory assumes phonological processing can start before lemma or word selection is completed. Most evidence is inconsistent with WEAVER++’s prediction. Meyer and Damian (2007) required participants to name target pictures while ignoring distractor pictures. According to WEAVER++, the phonological features of distrac- tor names should not have been activated. However, target pictures were named more slowly when accompanied by phonological related distractors (e.g., wall when ball was the target). In similar fashion, Roux and Bonin (2016) found naming times for a coloured target object (e.g., banana) slowed when a distractor was phonologically related to the target’s colour (e.g., yellow). Mädebach et al. (2011) found picture naming was slowed in the pres- ence of a phonologically similar distractor word only when the overall pro- cessing demands were relatively low. What do these findings mean? Serial processing (as predicted by Levelt) occurred when processing demands were high. In contrast, processing was more interactive (as predicted by Dell) when processing demands were low. Evaluation WEAVER++ has various successes to its credit. First, the assumption word production involves a series of stages moving from lexical selection to morphological encoding to phonological encoding is reasonably accurate (Indefrey, 2011; however, see next section, pp. 534–535). Second, Levelt’s theoretical approach was important in shifting the balance of research away from speech errors (which are relatively rare) towards precise timing of accurate word-production processes. Third, WEAVER++ is a simple and elegant model making many testable predictions. It is arguably easier to test WEAVER++ than more interactive theories such as Dell’s spreading- activation theory. Fourth, lexical or word selection often involves a com- petitive process as assumed theoretically. What are the limitations with WEAVER++? (1) It focuses narrowly on processes involved in the production of single words and so several processes involved in planning and producing sentences are de-emphasised. (2) There are many more interactions between different processing levels than assumed within WEAVER++ (see next section, pp. 534–535). As Melinger et al. (2014, p. 676) argued, “It is a plausible hypothesis that the language production system is fundamentally parallel in its operation.” Interactive exercise: WEAVER++ Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["dian peak activation times in msec after picture onset).","From Indefrey (2011)."]}

(4) As Harley (2013) pointed out, “The need for lemmas is [not] strongly motivated by the data. Most of the evidence really only demands a distinction between the semantic and the phonological levels.” Cognitive neuroscience Earlier we discussed Indefrey’s (2011) meta-analysis of ERP and other studies that provided strong support for WEAVER++. Munding et al. (2016) reported a similar meta-analysis to Indefrey (2011) based on simple speech-production tasks (e.g., picture naming; reading aloud). However, they included only studies using magneto-encephalography (whereas Indefrey (2011) focused mostly on ERP studies. This is important because MEG has superior spatial resolution. Munding et al.’s (2016) findings are shown in Figure 11.4. First, Levelt et al.’s (1999) assumption that cognitive functions near the top of the figure occur earlier than those further down was supported. Second, as Munding et al. concluded, “There is a great deal of overlap in diverse functions’ active periods, and substantial numbers of reports of theoretically ‘late’ functions being implicated early” (p. 452). For example, several studies found evidence of articulatory processing approximately 300–500 ms before the appropriate response is produced. Dubarry et al. (2017) assessed brain activity during a picture naming task. They replicated Munding et al.’s (2016) findings when using the typical procedure of averaging data across trials. However, they argued the averaging approach can provide “a blurred view of the underlying pro- cesses” (p. 415). When they focused at the level of single trials, there was much less evidence of parallel processing. Thus, findings based on averaged data may exaggerate the extent of parallel processing in speech production. In sum, evidence obtained using the techniques of cognitive neuro- science provides a complex picture. What conclusions can we draw? First, Figure 11.4 The timing of activation associated with different cognitive functions (colour indicates the number of studies reporting activity related to a given function).

Second, brain areas associated with supposedly “late” processes (e.g., phonological processes) are often active much earlier than predicted by Levelt et al. Perhaps top-down processes anticipate or predict the processes necessary later in speech production. Speech production: general cognitive processes Fifty years ago, it was often assumed humans possessed “language genes” and that language involves processes very different from those used in other cognitive tasks. Those assumptions have been increasingly rejected. It is now recognised that general processes (e.g., short-term memory; attention; cognitive control) play an important role in language processing (including speech production). Here we will briefly consider some relevant research. As mentioned earlier, Christiansen and Chater (2016) argued the very limited capacity of short-term memory means speakers (and listeners to speech) have to deal with a “now-or-never” bottleneck: “If linguistic infor- mation is not processed rapidly, that information is lost for good” (p. 3). How do speakers cope with this bottleneck? According to Christiansen and Chater (2016), children learn to form chunks (see Glossary) in which frequently encountered words are grouped together in long-term memory. As a result, an ever-increasing number of chunks is stored in a “chunka- tory”. This reduces processing demands by allowing speakers to focus on retrieving entire phrases (rather than single words) from long-term memory. MacDonald (2016) argued that there are important similarities between utterance planning (transient memory of what is to be spoken) and verbal memory (e.g., immediate serial recall of a word list). Here are some examples: (1) words close to each other are most likely to be exchanged; (2) similar words interfere with each other; (3) there are more errors in long lists/sentences than short ones. These findings suggest the processes involved in speech planning closely resemble those involved in verbal short-term memory. Proficient bilinguals rarely allow words from their unintended lan- guage to intrude into their speech. Top-down inhibitory processes play an important role in this achievement (Kroll & Navarro-Torres, 2018). For example, consider a Friulian-Italian bilingual patient (LI) with damage to the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate (brain areas associated with top-down control). He switched into Italian 40% of the time when he was meant to be speaking Friulian and into Friulian 43% of the time when Italian was required (Fabbro et al., 2000). On the picture naming task, participants show interference when a word distractor is presented together with each picture. Inhibitory pro- cesses are required to minimise such interference. Patients with damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex (involved in inhibition) have larger interfer- ence effects than healthy controls (Piai et al., 2016). Jongman et al. (2017) studied the relationship between sustained atten- tion and picture naming.

McClain and Goldrick (2018) discussed other research indicating the importance of attentional processes in speech production. In sum, general processes (e.g., attention; short-term memory; inhi- bition), de-emphasised in spreading-activation theory and WEAVER++, strongly influence speech production. For example, speakers’ use of inhibi- tory and other general processes may explain why the interactive processes emphasised within spreading-activation theory do not lead to numerous speech errors. In future, it will be important to develop theories indicating how general and language-specific processes combine in speech production. COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY: SPEECH PRODUCTION The cognitive neuropsychological approach to language started in the nine- teenth century. Its focus was on brain-damaged patients with aphasia, a condition involving severe impairments in language comprehension and/or production. Early researchers distinguished between Broca’s and Wernicke’s aphasia. Patients with Broca’s aphasia have slow, non-fluent speech. They also have a poor ability to produce syntactically correct sentences, but their sentence comprehension is relatively intact. Broca’s aphasia is gener- ally assumed to involve BA44 and BA45 in the inferior frontal gyrus (see Figure 11.5). In contrast, patients with Wernicke’s aphasia have fluent and appar- ently grammatical speech that often lacks meaning. They also have severe problems with speech comprehension. Wernicke’s aphasia is generally assumed to involve the posterior part of BA22 in the superior temporal gyrus (see Figure 11.5). In sum, the traditional approach assumed impaired language production was of central importance in Broca’s aphasia whereas impaired language comprehension was central to Wernicke’s aphasia. Dronkers et al. (2017) reviewed the relevant evidence and reported very limited support for the traditional approach. That approach was much KEY TERMS Aphasia Severe problems in the comprehension and/or production of language caused by brain damage.

Tremblay and Dick (2016) found the most popular definition of Wernicke’s area by experts was “the poste- rior part of the superior temporal gyrus and including part of the supramar- ginal gyrus” (p. 63) endorsed by 26% of respondents. The other respondents endorsed smaller or larger areas. The most popular definition of Broca’s area (endorsed by 50%) was that it consisted of the pars triangularis and pars opercularis with the remaining 50% identifying a smaller or larger area. Second, most aphasic patients have extensive brain damage (Flinker & Knight, 2018). As a result, the role played by Wernicke’s area of Broca’s area (however defined) is hard to establish. However, Flinker et al. (2015) found, by using precisely targeted electrical stimulation of the cortex, that Broca’s area supports articulatory planning but is not directly involved in production of spoken words. Third, “The areas of the brain that support language are far more extensive than Broca or Wernicke could ever have imagined” (Dronkers et al., 2017, p. 750). As we saw earlier, speech production involves general processes (e.g., attention; cognitive control) as well as language-specific processes (McClain & Goldrick, 2018). Language comprehension also involves similar general processes within a “multiple demand” network including several prefrontal areas (Blank & Fedorenko, 2017). Fourth, the finding that Broca’s patients find it much harder than Wernicke’s patients to speak grammatically is more common in English- speaking than German- or Italian-speaking patients. English is less inflected than German or Italian (with inflected languages, grammatical changes to nouns and verbs are indicated by changes to the words themselves). As a result, the grammatical limitations of English-speaking patients with Wernicke’s aphasia are less obvious (Dick et al., 2001). Fifth, aphasic patients may have general problems relating to attention and memory in addition to specific language impairments (McNeil et al., 2010). For example, healthy individuals naming pictures rapidly make errors resembling those of stroke aphasics with semantic impairments (Hodgson & Lambon Ralph, 2008). Thus, picture naming errors by apha- sics may partly reflect reduced processing resources or semantic control. In sum, the traditional approach is very limited. Accordingly, the emphasis has shifted towards systematic attempts to understand relatively specific cognitive impairments (see below). Anomia Nearly all aphasics (regardless of the type of aphasia) suffer from anomia (an impaired ability to name objects). Within Levelt et al.’s (1999) WEAVER++ model, there are two reasons aphasics might have problems with lexicalisation (translating a word’s meaning into its sound): (1) There could be problems at the semantic level (i.e., selecting the appropriate lemma or abstract word). In that case, naming errors would resemble the correct word in meaning. (2) There could be problems at the phonological level, in which case patients would be unable to find the appropriate form of the word.

(2009) divided aphasic patients into semantic and phono- logical groups based on their main cognitive impairment on various tasks. Both groups were then given a picture naming task and event-related poten- tials were recorded to assess the time course of processing. The semantic group had ERP abnormalities early (100–250 ms after picture onset). In contrast, the phonological group only had later abnormalities (300–450 ms after picture onset). Thus, anomia can result from an early semantic stage (finding the correct word) or a later phonological stage (generating the word’s phonological form). Patients with anomia having problems at the phonological (but not the semantic) level often resemble healthy individuals in a tip-of-the-tongue state (discussed earlier, see pp. 531–532). As a result, we might expect such patients to experience the tip-of-the-tongue state very frequently. Patients fitting this pattern (and having particular problems in producing low- frequency names) have been identified (Funnell et al., 1996). Gvion and Friedmann (2016) clarified the mechanisms involved in patients with anomia who have phonological problems. They focused on the phonological output lexicon, which contains the representation of a word’s spoken form (e.g., number of syllables; consonants; vowels). It is organised by word frequency so high-frequency words are more accessi- ble than low-frequency ones. Gvion and Friedmann found several patients with anomia had an impaired phonological output lexicon. However, these patients performed well on a word-comprehension task suggesting their semantic processing was reasonably intact. Nardo et al. (2018) studied 18 aphasic patients whose comprehension of spoken words was good. They used a treatment programme focusing on patients’ phonological problems: on a picture naming task, phonemic cues (e.g., initial phoneme of the word) were presented. This treatment produced short-term and long-term improvements in naming ability. Discovering anomia can result from difficulties at the semantic and/ or phonological levels is consistent with serial models (e.g., Levelt et al.’s WEAVER++). However, it does not rule out interactive models (e.g., Dell’s spreading-activation theory). Soni et al. (2009) compared these models using a picture naming task in three conditions differing in the cues accom- panying each picture: (1) correct cues (e.g., lion + the cue l ); (2) incorrect cues (e.g., lion + the cue t which misleadingly suggests tiger): (3) no cue. According to Levelt’s model, speakers determine the lemma (abstract word) appropriate to the object before using phonological information gen- erated by the cues. Thus, an incorrect phonological cue should not impair performance. Interactive models make the opposite prediction. Word selec- tion can be influenced by phonological activation and this can enhance (or impair) performance depending on whether the cue is correct or incorrect. The findings supported interactive models over serial ones. Soni et al. (2011) extended their research. Aphasics viewed pictures accompanied by a sound and named the picture. There were four condi- tions determined by the relationship between picture and sound. Suppose the picture showed a candle. The sound could be l (related category – suggests lamp), w (associate word – suggests wax), or neutral (g).

These findings suggest (contrary to Levelt et al., 1999) that semantic processing is not necessarily complete before phonological processing starts. Evaluation Much research on anomia is consistent with Levelt et al.’s (1999) notion that problems with word retrieval can occur at two different stages: (1) abstract word (lemma) selection; and (2) accessing the phonological form of the word. However, there is a potential problem with that explanation. There is suggestive evidence (Soni et al., 2009, 2011) for more interaction between semantic and phonological processing than assumed by Levelt et al. (1999). Agrammatism It is often assumed (e.g., Dell, 1986) that speaking involves separate stages of working out the syntax or grammatical structure of utterances and then producing content words to fit that grammatical structure. Patients who apparently can find the appropriate words but not order them gram- matically suffer from agrammatism (literally “without grammar”). Such patients produce short sentences containing content words (e.g., nouns; verbs) but lacking function words (e.g., the, in, and) and inflections (see Glossary). These omissions are important. For example, function words play a key role in producing a grammatical structure for sentences. As we will see, the agrammatic patients’ problems with syntactic processing often extend to language comprehension as well as speech. Use of the term “agrammatism” implies it forms a syndrome with all agrammatic patients having the same symptoms and with the same brain areas involved in most (or all) cases. It is the case that most agrammatic patients have damage to Broca’s area (BA44/45; see Figure 11.5) (Cappa, 2012). However, agrammatism is not a syndrome – many patients possess only some symptoms typical of agrammatism (Harley, 2013). Findings Engel et al. (2018) studied language comprehension in patients with agram- matic aphasia presented with sentences such as: (1) The grandma said that the baker cleaned herself with a clean washcloth. (2) The grandma said that the baker cleaned her with a clean washcloth. The above sentences differ only in that the pronoun in (1) is reflexive (i.e., herself ) whereas the pronoun in (2) (i.e., her) is not. Healthy controls had accurate comprehension of both types of sentences on over 90% of trials. In contrast, agrammatic patients performed much worse on sentences such as (2) (63% vs 90%, respectively). What do the above findings mean? Sentences such as (2) are slightly more complex grammatically. Agrammatic patients were considerably KEY TERM Agrammatism Literally, “without grammar”; a condition in which speech production lacks grammatical structure and many function words and word endings are omitted; there are often also problems with language comprehension.

Faroqui-Shah and Friedman (2015) considered verb tense impairment. It involves a failure to change the forms of verbs to reflect whether the reference is to the past, the present, or the future (e.g., omitting -ed when using a verb in the past tense). Agrammatic individuals had greater verb tense impairment when the task was more demanding (e.g., picture descrip- tion) than when it was less demanding (e.g., grammaticality judgement). They argued that these findings suggest that agrammatic individuals have reduced computational resources. Beeke et al. (2007) studied an agrammatic patient in the laboratory (using artificial tasks) and while conversing at home. His speech was more grammatical in the latter situation. Rhys et al. (2013) studied an agrammatic patient who used prosodic cues (e.g., stress; intonation) to communicate meanings and grammatical structures despite very limited speech. Christiansen et al. (2010) also considered whether the deficits of agrammatic patients are specific to language or whether they are more general. They found agrammatic patients with damage to Broca’s area (BA44/45) showed impaired sequence learning as well as grammaticality, indicating their deficits extend beyond language. How can we explain these findings? It seems reasonable that a deficit in sequence learning could lead to the production of ungrammatical sentences given the great dependence of grammaticality on appropriate word order. Uddén et al. (2017) pro- duced further evidence for the role of Broca’s area in sequence learning. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) applied to that area indicated it plays a causal role in sequence learning. Griffiths et al. (2013) shed light on brain pathways involved in syntac- tic processing. They studied patients with damage to a dorsal pathway con- necting part of Broca’s area (BA44) with part of Wernicke’s area (middle temporal gyrus) and/or a ventral pathway connecting another part of Broca’s area (BA45) with Wernicke’s area. Participants listened to sentences (e.g., “The woman is hugged by the man”) and then selected a drawing: (1) Figure 11.6 Semantic errors (left) and syntactic (right) errors made by: healthy controls and patients with no damage to the dorsal (D) or ventral (V) pathway, damage to the ventral pathway only, damage to the dorsal pathway only and damage to both pathways.

What did Griffiths et al. (2013) find? Patients with damage to either or both pathways made many more syntactic errors than controls or patients with damage to neither pathway (see Figure 11.6). However, very few semantic errors were made by any of the patient groups and the same was true on other semantic comprehension tasks. Evaluation Research on agrammatism can be related to Dell’s (1986) identification of four levels (semantic; syntactic; morphological; and phonological) of speech production. More specifically, agrammatics primarily have problems at the syntactic level at which the grammatical structure of a sentence is formed (Dell, 1986). Of theoretical importance, there is accumulating evidence that agrammatic individuals have general deficits as well as language-specific ones. For example, they have impaired sequence learning and reduced pro- cessing or computational resources. What are the limitations of research on agrammatism? First, the symp- toms of agrammatic patients are too diverse for it to form a syndrome. Second, agrammatic patients may possess more grammatical competence than generally assumed. Third, more research is required to establish the extent to which agrammatism involves language-specific deficits versus more general ones. Jargon aphasia Jargon aphasia “is an extreme form of fluent aphasia in which syntax is primarily intact, but speech is marked by gross word-finding difficulties” (Harley, 2013). This pattern is superficially the opposite to that of patients with agrammatism, who can find the correct content words but cannot produce grammatically correct sentences. Jargon aphasics often produce jargon (including neologisms, which are made-up words, and real words unrelated phonologically to the target word). Finally, jargon aphasics have deficient self-monitoring – they are generally unaware their speech con- tains numerous errors and become irritated when others fail to understand them. Here is how a jargon aphasic described a picture (Sampson & Faroqui- Shah, 2011): It’s not a large house, it’s small, unless an awful lot of it goes back behind the hose. They are whiking what they are doing in the front part which must be peeving . . . leeling . . . weeding . . . there is a nico- verit spotole for the changer. Findings How grammatical is the speech of jargon aphasics?

What factors determine the specific form of jargon aphasics’ neologisms? First, and of most importance, they exhibit a failure of phoneme selection even when the appropriate target word is initially selected. For example, Olson et al. (2015) studied three jargon aphasic patients who performed naming, repetition, and reading tasks. More specifically, the phonemes from target words were often only weakly activated and so were outcompeted by non-target phonemes. These non-target phonemes were often phonologi- cally related to target phonemes or were phonemes used recently. Pilkington et al. (2017) analysed the neologisms produced by 25 patients with jargon aphasia. Those produced by 23 of these patients were related phonologically to the target (intended) word. These findings also indicate a major role for deficient phonological encoding in the production of neologisms. If impaired phoneme selection is responsible for patients’ impaired speech production, therapy designed to enhance phonemic processing might prove beneficial. Bose (2013) found that therapy focused on gener- ating and analysing phonological features of words reduced the number of neologisms produced by FF, a man with jargon aphasia. Second, deficient self-monitoring plays a major role in jargon aphasia. Sampson and Faroqui-Shah (2008) obtained a negative correlation between self-monitoring and the production of jargon in jargon aphasics. Eaton et al. (2011) studied a male jargon aphasic (TK) over a 21-month period. His improved word naming performance over time correlated highly with increased self-monitoring suggesting inadequate self-monitoring played a role in TK’s initially poor performance. Third, the production of jargon by jargon aphasics is sometimes influ- enced by impaired general cognitive abilities. For example, Robinson et al. (2015) studied a male jargon aphasic (JA) who produced almost mean- ingless sentences. He had impaired cognitive control and so he had no “brake” inhibiting production of meaningless phrases. Evaluation Several factors responsible for jargon aphasics’ production of neologisms and other jargon have been identified. Impaired phoneme selection is typ- ically of most importance. Some evidence indicates that jargon aphasics often have impaired cognitive or inhibitory control (linked to deficient self-monitoring) as well as more language-specific deficits. A limitation of much research is that insufficient attention has been paid to possible semantic deficits in addition to problems with phoneme selection (Harley, 2013). More research is also needed to assess more precisely the grammaticality (or otherwise) of jargon aphasics’ spoken utterances. Conclusions Most theories of speech production are based on the assumption, “There are independent levels of representation/processing that encode word meaning Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":[".","Neologisms Made-up words produced by patients suffering from jargon aphasia."]}

The evidence based on brain-damaged patients provides support for this overarching assumption. In this section, we have focused on the patterns of language impair- ment in patients categorised as suffering from anomia, agrammatism or jargon aphasia. Such categorisations mistakenly imply all patients assigned to a given category have very similar language impairments. Mirman et al. (2015) avoided the use of categories. They used several tasks to assess various aspects of word recognition and production in 99 aphasic patients and also assessed the brain areas damaged in those patients. Mirman et al. (2015) used a statistical technique known as factor analysis to identify the major components underlying patients’ patterns of impaired language performance. There was a major division between semantic and phonological processing and each form of processing was subdivided into language perception and language production. In future, this approach could potentially allow us to move away from an overreli- ance on categories or syndromes to a focus on similarities and differences among aphasic. Another general conclusion is that the speech-production problems of many aphasics (e.g., agrammatic individuals; jargon aphasics) depend in part on general cognitive processes as well as on language-specific ones. Evidence that general cognitive processes are important in the speech pro- duction of healthy individuals was reported by Zhang et al. (2018) using a picture naming task. Their key finding was that successfully coping with increased task difficulty involved additional activation in language- specific brain areas and general cognitive control (e.g., inhibition) areas. The role of general processes in language processing is discussed further in the intro- ductory section entitled Part III: Language. SPEECH AS COMMUNICATION Most theories and research discussed so far focus on monologue. In the real world, however, our speech nearly always occurs as conversation in a social context. Dialogue involves various complexities: “Both interlocutors [individuals involved in a conversation] must simultaneously produce their own contributions and comprehend the other’s contribution” (Pickering & Garrod, 2013, p. 330). Thus, as discussed earlier, speech production and speech comprehension are interwoven (Meyer et al., 2016). Grice (e.g., 1975) considered the requirements of successful commu- nication in his cooperative principle: “Make your conversational contri- bution such as is required . . . by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged” (Grice, 1989, p. 88). Grice’s use of the term “cooperation” was narrower than its common usage (Davies, 2007). It should be seen in the context of his four maxims speakers should heed: ● Maxim of relevance: the speaker should say things relevant to the situation. ● Maxim of quantity: the speaker should be as informative as necessary. ● Maxim of quality: the speaker should be truthful.

(2015). ● Maxim of manner: the speaker should make their contribution easy to understand. There are two issues with Grice’s approach. First, is unclear we need four maxims – the other three maxims are implied by the maxim of relevance. Second, in the real world, many individuals (e.g., secondhand car salesper- sons; politicians) ignore one or more of the maxims out of self-interest. For example, an analysis of Donald Trump’s statements during 2015 revealed that he lied (failed to adhere to the maxim of quality) 76% of the time (Holan, 2015). Speakers (even when not guided by self-interest) often fail to adhere to Grice’s four maxims. Suppose a speaker tries to provide enough informa- tion so a listener can identify the target item of clothing from an array (see Figure 11.7). Speakers included colour in their statements on 79% of trials even though it was unnecessary and so represented overspecification not adhering to the maxim of quantity (Tarenskeen et al., 2015). Tarenskeen et al. (2015) carried out another experiment that included many trials where it was necessary for speakers to include colour, pattern or size in their statements. As a result, each attribute was included in their statements on 70% or more of trials when it was not necessary. This wide- spread overspecification was probably due to the speakers’ desire to be consistent in their statements. In sum, speakers often fail to adhere to Grice’s maxims. However, overspecification (unlike underspecification) typically has no negative effects on listeners’ comprehension and so is essentially harmless. Audience design There has been a dramatic increase in research focusing on what speakers say and how they say it when addressing one or more listeners. Much of this research focuses on audience design, which “refers to the situation in which speakers fashion their utterances so as to cater to the needs of their addressees” (Ferreira, 2019). For example, communication can be facilitated by establishing and extending common ground (see Chapter 9). KEY TERM Audience design This involves speakers tailoring what they say to the specific needs and knowledge of their audience.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nLanguage production 545 Common ground consists of “knowledge that is shared with a communica- tion partner, and that the communication partners know each other know” (Brown-Schmidt & Duff, 2016, pp. 722–723). Common ground can include several kinds of information (e.g., objects or events visible to both partners; shared cultural values; shared experiences). Ferreira (2019) identified two broad forms of audience design. First, there is a simple form based on general characteristics of the listener. For example, a speaker will typically plan shorter and simpler sentences when talking to a child rather than an adult: this is child-directed speech (see Glossary). This form of audience design typically makes modest demands on processing effort. Second, there is a more complex form based on idiosyncratic charac- teristics of the listener and/or the context. This can involve considerable processing effort (e.g., taking full account of common ground) and altera- tions to planned utterances (e.g., you are talking to someone and they start looking at their mobile phone). Theories Horton and Keysar (1996) proposed their monitoring and adjustment model to account for speakers’ successful (and unsuccessful) use of common ground. Speakers initially plan their utterances using information available to them without considering the listener’s perspective or knowledge. These plans are then monitored and corrected to incorporate common ground. However, it is often computationally hard for speakers to focus on the lis- tener’s perspective while planning what to say. Accordingly, they often ego- centrically focus on their own perspective and ignore the common ground. Ferreira (2019) developed the above ideas in his forward modelling approach (see Figure 11.8). Speakers use their communicative intention (i.e., what they want to say) to generate utterances (left-hand side of the figure). They also often produce a forward model (including a model of audience comprehension) to predict the likely effect on the audience of gen- erating those utterances. Of crucial importance, if the predictive commu- nicative effect mismatches the speaker’s intent, their message is changed to reduce the mismatch. This entire process is typically cognitively demanding and so speakers sometimes lack sufficient resources to produce a forward model plus a model of audience comprehension. Memory plays an important role in audience design. For example, Horton and Gerrig (2016) argued that memory limitations mean speakers sometimes assume less common ground than is actually the case. Suppose you have told very few friends about a recent event. As a result, you mis- takenly assume the friend you are talking to does not share that common ground. The opposite can also happen: you have told nearly all your friends about an event and mistakenly assume the one with whom you are currently talking was among them. Findings Effective use of common ground occurs most often when the listener’s knowledge and needs are readily accessible. Achim et al.

Speakers used each character’s name much more often when introduc- ing and reintroducing known characters. They thus made effective use of common ground because it was easy. Craycraft and Brown-Schmidt (2018) tested the hypothesis that speak- ers only assume they have formed common ground with listeners when those listeners appear to be attentive. As predicted, speakers who had com- municated information to an inattentive listener (e.g., glancing repeatedly around the room; pulling out their mobile phone) did not subsequently assume they shared common ground with their listener. Thus, speakers are often responsive to the listener’s attentional state. In contrast, Fukumura and van Gompel (2012) found speakers often ignored listeners’ knowledge. Speakers typically use a noun phrase (e.g., “the red desk”) the first time an object is mentioned but a pronoun (e.g., “it”) in the next sentence. However, it is only appropriate to use a pronoun in the second sentence provided the listener has heard the previous sen- tence. In fact, speakers generally used a pronoun in the second sentence even when the listener had not heard the previous sentence, thus ignoring audience design. According to the monitoring and adjustment model and Ferreira’s (2019) forward modelling approach, it is often cognitively demanding to take account of the listener’s perspective. Accordingly, we might expect speakers with superior cognitive abilities to make more use of common ground. As predicted, Long et al. (2018) found that speakers high in the executive functions of inhibition and switching (see Chapter 6) used common ground more often than low scorers.

Speakers took less account of common ground when they spoke under time pressure than when they had as much time available as they wanted. According to Horton and Gerrig (2016; mentioned earlier, p. 545), speakers’ memory failures often cause errors in the use of common ground. Empirical support was obtained previously by Horton and Gerrig (2005), who analysed numerous spontaneous telephone conversations. Here is an example of a speaker assuming too little common ground: A: This one guy with- who was like a a fresh br- breeze blown through the factory uh uh uh twenty-four twenty-five-year-old guy B: Oh, yeah you mentioned him. [p. 19] Here is an example of a speaker assuming too much common ground: A: Yeah okay. I told you about the shampoo did I tell you? B: What shampoo no. [p. 19] This example is especially interesting because it suggests the speaker was monitoring the accuracy of their memory and begins to doubt its accuracy. Rubin et al. (2011) obtained strong evidence of the importance of memory. Amnesic patients with severely impaired episodic memory (see Glossary) made far less use of information about common ground than healthy controls. However, amnesic patients made reasonably effective use of common ground when the relevant information was readily available. Further evidence that amnesic speakers can often communicate effec- tively despite their memory problems was reported by Yoon et al. (2017). Amnesic speakers provided shorter descriptions of objects to listeners to whom they had previously described those objects than to new listeners. Thus, they were sensitive to the presence or absence of common ground with their listener. This happened because the amnesic speakers could iden- tify the listener as new or old. Finally, speakers use various simple and relatively effortless strategies to facilitate communication. One example is syntactic priming (copying a previously heard syntactic structure; see p. 518). Jaeger and Snider (2013) found speakers were most likely to show syntactic priming when the last sentence they heard contained an unexpected syntactic structure. Speakers strive to “get on the same wavelength” as the person with whom they are speaking and this helps to achieve that goal. Gesture Most speakers use gestures. It is generally assumed they do this because they believe it increases their ability to communicate with their listener(s). This belief is correct (see Chapter 9). Human communication probably depended on gestures in our ances- tral past and it was only much later that vocalisation emerged.

It seems reasonable to assume speakers use gestures more often when they can see the person to whom they are speaking. Surprisingly, this finding has been obtained in only 50% of studies (Bavelas & Healing, 2013). Why do speakers use gestures that cannot be seen by their listeners? Gestures make it easier for speakers to communicate effectively. Frick- Horbury and Guttentag (1998) presented participants with the definitions of relatively uncommon words (e.g., tambourine) and asked them to say the word defined. When it was hard to use gestures, speakers produced 21% fewer words than when they were free to use gestures. Gerwing and Allison (2011) asked speakers to describe an elaborate dress to a visible or non-visible listener. The number of gestures was com- parable in both conditions. However, speakers’ gestures were much more informative in the face-to-face situation. In that situation, 74% of the information communicated was via gestures and only 26% via speech. In contrast, only 27% of the information communicated in the telephone sit- uation was gestural. Gestures are often modified to take account of the common ground between speakers and listeners. Hilliard and Cook (2016) used a task where speakers communicated information about how to solve a complex problem. When the common ground between speakers and listeners was limited, speakers used more informative gestures than when the common ground was more extensive. However, speakers’ spoken language was not influenced by the extent of common ground. Gesture and speech provide a unified system for communication and so either gesture or speech can be modified to take account of common ground. How responsive are speakers to listeners’ feedback? Holler and Wilkin (2011) compared speakers’ gestures before and after listener feedback. There were two main findings: (1) The number of gestures reduced when the listener indicated under- standing of what had been said. (2) Feedback encouraging clarification, elaboration or correction was followed by more precise, larger or more visually prominent gestures. In sum, gestures are an important accompaniment to speech. Speakers use gestures because they make it easier to work out what they want to say, In addition, the fact that speakers are responsive to listeners’ needs (includ- ing the feedback they provide) means gestures facilitate communication (see Chapter 9). Prosodic cues Some information communicated by speakers to listeners does not depend directly on the words themselves but rather on how those words are uttered. This is prosody, which describes “systematic modifications to the way that speakers utter words in order to specify or disambiguate the meaning of an utterance” (Cvejic et al., 2012, p. 442).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nLanguage production 549 Prosodic cues include rhythm, stress and intonation. For example, in the ambiguous sentence, “The old men and women sat on the bench”, the women may be or may not be old. If the women are not old, the spoken duration of the word “men” should be relatively long and the stressed syl- lable in “women” will have a steep rise in pitch contour. Neither prosodic feature will be present if the sentence means the women are old. Evidence that listeners’ comprehension of speech is enhanced by prosodic cues is discussed in Chapter 9. Gueliaï et al. (2014) found gestures accompanying speech carry pro- sodic information. When listeners heard ambiguous sentences with a mis- match between the prosodic cues in the speech and the gestures, listeners more often understood these sentences in line with the gestural information. Discourse markers Speakers can also enhance listener comprehension by using discourse markers. Discourse markers are words or phrases assisting communica- tion even though they are only indirectly relevant to the speaker’s message. Among the ways they do this are by expressing the speaker’s attitude and facilitating turn-taking in conversations (Hata, 2016). Speakers use the dis- course marker you know, for example, to check whether listeners under- stand them and to connect with them. We are often unaware of the reasons why we use various discourse markers. For example, what determines whether you say oh or so when moving on to a new conversational topic? Bolden (2006) found oh was used 98.5% of the time when the new topic directly concerned the speaker. In contrast, so was used 96% of the time when the new topic was of most relevance to the listener. In sum, discourse markers often make it easier for listeners to under- stand speakers’ intended meanings. However, we can also consider discourse markers in the context of disfluencies (e.g., pauses; repetitions). Crible (2017) analysed 15 hours of speech containing a total of 161,700 words and found frequent clusters including disfluencies and discourse markers. She concluded that discourse markers are often simply disfluencies. WRITING: THE MAIN PROCESSES Writing is an important topic in its own right (no pun intended!). However, it is not separate from other cognitive activities. As Kellogg and Whiteford (2012, p. 111) pointed out, Composing extended texts is . . . a severe test of memory, language, and thinking ability. It depends on the rapid retrieval of domain- specific knowledge about the topic from long-term memory. It depends on a high degree of verbal ability . . . It depends on the ability to think clearly. Unsurprisingly, writing ability is positively correlated with several aspects of cognitive ability (e.g., fluid reasoning ability) (Cormier et al., 2016). KEY TERMS Prosodic cues Features of spoken language such as stress, intonation, pauses and duration making it easier for listeners to work out grammatical structure and meaning; similar cues are often present in texts (e.g., commas; semi-colons). Discourse markers Spoken words and phrases that do not contribute directly to the content of what is being said but still serve various functions (e.g., clarifying the speaker’s intentions).

In view of the cognitive complexities of effective writing, it seems proba- ble mild cognitive impairment would also impair writing performance. Research has been carried out on Iris Murdoch (1919–1999), the renowned Irish novelist who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Garrard et al. (2005) compared her first pub- lished work, a novel written during her prime, and her final novel. Iris Murdoch’s vocabulary became less sophisticated (e.g., smaller vocab- ulary; more common words) across these three works but changes in syntax were less clear- cut. Subsequent research by Pakhomov et al. (2011) showed the syntactic complexity of Iris Murdoch’s writing decreased over time. Thus, aspects of Iris Murdoch’s writing were adversely affected several years before she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease during a period in which she probably had mild cognitive impairment. Le et al. (2011) carried out a detailed longitudinal analysis of the writings of Iris Murdoch, Agatha Christie (suspected of having Alzheimer’s disease towards the end of her life) and P.D. James (a novelist with no signs of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease). They confirmed previous findings that there were signs of impairment in Iris Murdoch’s writing a considerable time before she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Le et al. (2011) claimed Agatha Christie’s last novels indicated she probably suffered the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. The writing impairments of Agatha Christie and Iris Murdoch both involved vocabulary much more than syntax. More specifically, they both showed a sharp decrease in vocab- ulary size, increased repetition of phrases, and irrelevant filler words or phrases. Van Velzen et al. (2014) reported a detailed comparison of the writings of Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie focusing on their lexical diversity (richness of vocabulary). Iris Murdoch had a much earlier and more sudden reduction in lexical diversity than Agatha Christie. They concluded Agatha Christie did not have Alzheimer’s disease but rather some other neurodegenerative condition. In contrast, P.D. James showed only marginal writing impairments in old age due to normal ageing. In sum, there are detectable impairments in the writing of novelists probably suffering from mild cognitive impairment. These impairments can provide an early indication of Alzheimer’s disease (or other neurodegenerative diseases), and probably reflect in part the cognitive com- plexity of writing. However, even the onset of Alzheimer’s disease has only modest effects on syntax. Thus, cognitive impairment affects the content of what is written more than its grammat- ical structure.

In spite of minor disa- greements about the number and nature of these processes, most theorists agree with Hayes and Flower (1986) that writing involves the following three processes: (1) A planning process which involves producing ideas and organising them to satisfy the writer’s goals. (2) A sentence-generation process which involves turning the writing plan into the actual production of sentences. (3) A revision process which involves evaluating what has been written or word processed so far and changing it when necessary. Chenoweth and Hayes (2003) developed the above approach. Their model identifies four processes: (1) Proposer: it proposes ideas for expression and is engaged in higher-level planning processes. (2) Translator: it converts the message formed by the proposer into word strings (e.g., sentences). (3) Transcriber: it converts the word strings into written or word pro- cessed text. (4) Evaluator/reviser: it monitors and evaluates what has been produced and engages in revision of deficiencies. The main difference between the two approaches described above is that Chenoweth and Hayes (2003) added a transcriber. Why did they do that? Hayes and Flower assumed transcribing (writing sentences already com- posed) requires minimal processing resources and so had no impact on other writing processes. However, that assumption is incorrect. Hayes and Chenoweth (2006) asked participants to transcribe or copy texts from one computer window to another. They transcribed more slowly when per- forming a very simple task (saying tap repeatedly) at the same time. Tindle and Longstaff (2016) found the task of writing down heard words utilised working-memory resources. The latest version of the above writing model (Hayes, 2012; shown in Figure 11.9) incorporates the four writing processes identified by Chenoweth and Hayes (2003). However, it is more comprehensive because the process level has been expanded to include the task environment and there are additional control and resource levels. Of importance, the current version includes motivation as a factor. Writing effectively is so demanding (as the authors of this book know to their cost!) that high motivation is required to engage in prolonged evaluation and revision of what has been written. There is a final point. The “natural” sequence of the four main writing processes is as follows: proposer; translator; transcriber; and evaluator. As we will see, however, writers surprisingly often deviate from this sequence, switching rapidly between processes.

Medimorec and Risko (2017) analysed the pause data of students writing narrative essays (about a mem- orable day) and argumentative essays (about mobile-phone use in schools). Pauses occurred most often at paragraph boundaries, followed by sentence boundaries, suggesting they often indicate planning processes. Limpo and Alves (2018) studied key aspects of writing dynamics using the triple-task technique. Participants engaged in writing an argu- mentative text (about controversial university initiation rites) were asked to respond as rapidly as possible to occasional auditory beeps. After they had responded, they indicated which writing process they had just been using: planning, translating or revising. This is known as directed retrospection. What did Limpo and Alves (2018) find? First, time spent on plan- ning reduced during the course of writing (see Figure 11.10). Second, the time spent on the revising process increased over time. Third, all three writing processes (i.e., planning, translating and revising) occurred during all phases of the writing process. Fourth, reaction times to the occasional beeps were slowed most during revising and least during translating. These findings indicate that revising was the most cognitively demanding process, followed by planning and translating in that order. Beauvais et al. (2011) found writers switched rapidly between differ- ent processes: 8 times a minute with narrative texts (telling a story) and 6 times a minute with argumentative texts (discussing ideas). Each episode of translating lasted on average 16 seconds (narrative text) or 17 seconds (argumentative text), planning 8 seconds (narrative text) or 12 seconds (argumentative text), and revision (4 seconds for both texts). Thus, as Levy and Ransdell (1995) found, episodes of planning and revising were shorter than translating or text generation. Figure 11.9 Hayes’ (2012) writing model. It consists of three levels: (1) control level (including motivation and goal setting); (2) writing process level (including proposer, evaluator, translator and transcriber); and (3) resource level (including working memory, attention and long-term memory).

Hayes and Flower (1980) argued writers have a monitor (closely resembling the central executive component of the working memory model: see Chapter 6) con- trolling their processing activities. Two functions of the central executive are to switch attention between tasks and to inhibit unwanted responses. If the monitor requires working memory resources, it should be less likely to trigger a switch in the current task when current processing demands are high. Quinlan et al. (2012) tested this assumption. Writers chose whether to complete a sentence before correcting an error or to interrupt sentence composing to focus on the error. Nearly all participants completed the sentence first (especially when total processing demands were high). Evaluation Processes such as planning, sentence generation and revision are all crucial in writing. However, they cannot be neatly separated because writers typi- cally move rapidly between them. Writers probably possess a monitor initi- ating processing shifts when overall processing demands are relatively low. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, the factors determining when writers shift processes are mostly unknown. Second, the social aspect of writing (i.e., taking account of the intended reader- ship of written texts) is often de-emphasised (see below). Third, the ways writing processes interact are not specified with precision. For example, Hayes (2012; Figure 11.8) failed to indicate how the four resources relate to writing processes. Individual differences in writing: development of expertise Why are some writers more skilful than others? As with any complex cog- nitive skill, extensive deliberate practice is essential (see Chapter 12). In the next section, we will see the working memory system (see Chapter 6) Figure 11.10 The frequency of three major writing processes (planning, translating and revising) across the three phases (thirds) of writing.

From Kellogg (2008). Reprinted with permission of the Journal of Writing Research www.jowr. org. is very important. All its components have limited capacity. However, the demands of writing on these components decrease with practice, which pro- vides experienced writers with spare processing capacity to enhance their writing quality. Writing expertise often depends on reading ability. Berninger and Abbott (2010) assessed the four main language skills in children. Overall, writing performance was predicted best by reading comprehension, fol- lowed by speech production and then speech comprehension. Kent and Wanzek (2016) conducted a meta-analysis, also finding reading com- prehension predicted writing quality better than did speech-production ability. How can we explain the above findings? Reading allows writers to learn much about the structure and style of good writing; it also enhances their vocabulary and knowledge. However, most evidence is correlational and so does not prove writing ability is caused by reading comprehension. For example, writing expertise may enhance reading com- prehension skills. Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) identified two major strategies writers use. First, there is the knowledge-telling strategy: writers simply write down all they know about a topic with minimal planning. Second, the more complex knowledge-transforming strategy involves working out how to achieve the writing goals and how to decide on the specific information to write down. Optimal use of this strategy involves moving backwards and forwards between these two aims. Kellogg and Whiteford (2012) developed the above approach (see Figure 11.11). They argued that really expert writers move beyond the knowledge-transforming strategy by using a knowledge-crafting strategy.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.\n\nLanguage production 555 With this strategy “The writer shapes what to say and how to say it with the potential reader fully in mind. The writer tries to anticipate different ways that the reader might interpret the text and takes these into account in revising it” (Kellogg & Whiteford, 2012, p. 116). One reason why knowledge crafting is important is because of the knowledge effect – writers often assume other people share the knowl- edge they possess. Hayes and Bajzek (2008) found individuals familiar with technical terms greatly overestimated other people’s knowledge of these terms (are the authors of this book guilty of this?). Findings The knowledge-transforming strategy is effective for various reasons. Writers using this strategy produce more high-level main points capturing important themes (Bereiter et al., 1988) and show more extensive interac- tions between planning, language generation and reviewing. This strategy is used more effectively if writers enhance their relevant knowledge prior to writing an essay (Chuy et al., 2012). The resultant essays were more coher- ent and easier to read. Expert writers spend more time revising than non-expert ones. Levy and Ransdell (1995) found writers producing the best essays spent 40% more time reviewing and revising their essays than those producing the worst essays. In addition, expert writers detect many more problems in a text than non-experts (Hayes et al., 1985). Evidence that knowledge-crafting skills are important was reported by Karlen (2017). Students were required to write an academic paper. Those possessing the most knowledge about how to craft texts made greatest use of knowledge-crafting strategies while writing and this in turn enhanced the quality of their writing. Knowledge-crafting skills can be trained. For example, responsiveness to the reader’s needs can be improved by providing writers with feedback from readers about comprehension problems they had experienced (Sato & Matshushima, 2006). Wischgoll (2016) found students developing their knowledge-crafting skills by a meta-cognitive strategy (e.g., “Can I com- prehend my text if I read it from the reader’s perspective?”, p. 7) showed greater enhancement of their writing skills than those using other strategies. Finally, the requirements of expert writing depend on the type of text (e.g., an advanced textbook vs a children’s story). Beauvais et al. (2011) found moderately expert writers engaged in more knowledge-telling when producing narrative rather than argumentative texts. However, the oppo- site was the case for knowledge-transforming. In other words, the writers tailored their writing behaviour to the requirements of the type of text they were producing. Working memory Most people find writing difficult and effortful because it involves several different cognitive processes (e.g., attention; thinking; memory). Several theorists have argued writers make extensive use of working memory to deal with these complexities. This argument was supported by Tindle and KEY TERM Knowledge effect The tendency to assume others possess the same knowledge as us.

Working memory is used when a task requires temporary storage of some information while other information is processed (see Chapter 6). That is clearly the case with writing – writers have to remember what they have just written while planning what they are going to write next. The key component of the working memory system is the central exec- utive (see Glossary), an attention-like process involved in organising and coordinating cognitive activities. Other components of the working memory system are the visuo-spatial sketchpad (involved in visual and spatial pro- cessing) and the phonological loop (involved in verbal rehearsal). All these components have limited capacity. This can easily cause problems with the writing process, which is often very cognitively demanding. All components of working memory are involved in writing. Kellogg (2001) linked these components to five processes involved in writing (see Table 11.1). These processes overlap with those identified by Chenoweth and Hayes (2003; described earlier, pp. 551–552). Planning corresponds to the proposer, translating to the translator, programming is part of the transcriber, and reading and editing together relate to the evaluator/reviser (reading involves going back over what has been written so far). Kellogg et al. (2013) reconsidered the information contained in Table 11.1 and decided the phonological loop is actually involved in the editing process. Research by Hayes and Chenoweth (2006; discussed earlier, p. 551) showed error correction while copying text was slowed down when the phonological loop was required for another task. Findings As you can see in Table 11.1, Kellogg (2001) assumed writing performance depends more on the central executive than any other working memory component. We can assess its involvement by measuring reaction times to auditory beeps presented in isolation (control condition) or while people are engaged in writing. If writing uses much of the central executive’s capacity, reaction times should be longer during writing. In a study discussed earlier (Limpo & Alves, 2018), planning, translating and revising all slowed reac- tion times (especially planning).

Vanderberg and Swanson (2007) adopted this approach. Students wrote stories and their performance was divided into general skills (e.g., planning, translating, revision) and specific skills (e.g., grammar, punctuation). Individuals having the most effective central executive functioning exhibited the greatest general and specific skills. In contrast, individual differences in the functioning of the visuo-spatial sketchpad and phonological loop did not influence performance. Guan et al. (2014) studied the effects of individual differences in working memory capacity (an approximate measure of central executive functioning; see Glossary). Essay-writing quality was predicted by working memory capacity. In similar fashion, Van der Steen et al. (2017) found students high in working memory capacity produced more complex essays than low-capacity individuals. Another approach is to study brain-damaged individuals with impaired central executive functioning suffering from dysexecutive syndrome (see Glossary; and Chapter 6). Many patients with dysexecutive syndrome have difficulties planning and organising their ideas on writing tasks and in maintaining attention (Ardila & Surloff, 2006). Ardila and Surloff coined the term dysexecutive agraphia to refer to such patients. Sitek et al. (2014) studied four patients with dysexecutive agraphia who had demen- tia causing severe cognitive impairment. Progressive deterioration in their writing skills was closely linked to more general cognitive impairment. What role does the phonological loop play in writing? We can address this question using an articulatory suppression task (e.g., saying the the the repeatedly) while individuals are engaged in a writing task. Articulatory suppression tasks use the resources of the phonological loop and so impair performance on other concurrent tasks requiring the phonological loop. Articulation suppression causes writers to produce shorter sequences of words (suggesting it suppresses their “inner voice”; Chenoweth & Hayes, 2003); it also slows down transcribing or copying texts (Hayes & Chenoweth, 2006). Finally, Colombo et al. (2009) found articulatory suppression impaired writers’ ability to produce the component parts of multi-syllable words in the correct serial order. The above findings strongly suggest the phonological loop is often used during writing. However, we must not exaggerate its impor- tance. Some patients with a severely damaged phonological loop neverthe- less have essentially intact written language (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). What role does the visuo-spatial sketchpad play in writing? Relevant research was reviewed by Olive and Passerault (2012). Bourke et al. (2014) found individual differences in visuo-spatial working memory predicted children’s spelling and writing ability. Kellogg et al. (2007) asked students to write descriptions of concrete (e.g., house) and abstract (e.g., freedom) nouns while detecting visual stimuli. The writing task slowed detection times only when concrete words were being described, indicating the visuo-spatial sketchpad is more involved when writers think about concrete objects. Somewhat separate visual and spatial processes occur within the visuo-spatial sketchpad (see Chapter 6). Are both processes involved in writing? Olive et al. (2008) asked students to write a text while performing a visual or spatial task and discovered the answer is “Yes”.

Individuals with high working memory capacity have good general and spe- cific writing skills. The central executive is heavily involved in most writing processes. There is also convincing evidence the visuo-spatial sketchpad and phonological loop are both involved in the writing process. The visuo- spatial sketchpad is involved in planning and editing, and the phonological loop seems to be of relevance to various writing processes. What are the limitations of theory and research on working memory in writing? First, we do not know precisely why planning, sentence generation and revising are so demanding of processing resources. Second, there is little understanding of the role of working memory in influencing when and why writers shift from one writing process to another. However, switching of processes may be less likely when total working memory demands are high (Quinlan et al., 2012). Third, working memory (and other) processes are used flexibly and in parallel (i.e., at the same time) in writing (Olive, 2014). However, the factors determining when and how these processes are used in parallel (and how they interact with each other) remain unclear. Fourth, most research has been based on Baddeley’s working memory model with other approaches (e.g., theories based on working memory capacity; see Chapter 6) receiving little attention. These other approaches could potentially enhance our understanding of the processes underlying writing performance. Word processing Goldberg et al. (2003) carried out meta-analyses to compare writing per- formance when students used word processors or wrote in longhand. They concluded as follows: “Students who use computers when learning to write are not only more engaged in their writing but they produce work that is of greater length and higher quality” (Goldberg et al., 2003, p. 1). Van der Steen et al. (2017) found students wrote faster and produced essays of higher quality when using word processing rather than writing by hand. Why was this? Students spent more time pausing in the word process- ing condition, and pausing was associated with more revision and thinking. Are there any disadvantages associated with word processing? Kellogg and Mueller (1993) found word processing involves more effortful planning and revision (but not sentence generation) than writing in longhand. Those using word processors were much less likely to make notes (12% vs 69%, respectively), which may explain the findings. SPELLING Spelling is an important aspect of writing. Brain areas involved in spelling were identified by Planton et al. (2013; see Figure 11.12) in a meta-analytic review.

Dual-route theory Several theorists (e.g., Hepner et al., 2017) have proposed versions of the dual-route theory for understanding the processes involved in spelling (see Figure 11.13(b)): ● The most important assumption is that there are two main routes between hearing a word and spelling it: (1) the lexical route (left-hand side of the figure); (2) the non-lexical route (right-hand side of the figure). ● The lexical route involves accessing word sounds in phonologi- cal long-term memory followed by accessing word meanings in the lexical semantic system and word spellings in orthographic long-term memory. It is the main route we use with familiar words regardless of whether the relationship between sounds (phonemes) and spellings (orthography) is regular (e.g., cat) or irregular (e.g., yacht). ● The non-lexical route does not involve gaining access to detailed information about the sound, meaning and spelling of heard words. Instead, it uses rules to convert sounds or phonemes into groups of Figure 11.12 Brain areas activated during handwriting tasks, controlling for verbal or linguistic input (red) or motor output (green). The areas in yellow are controlled for both and so provide an indication of handwriting-specific brain regions.

It produces correct spellings when the relationship between sounds and spellings is regular or common but spelling errors when the relationship is irregular or uncommon. ● Both routes converge on orthographic working memory (also known as the graphemic buffer). This briefly holds information about the letters within a word and the ordering of those letters before they are written or typed. ● The processes and structures involved in spelling (Figure 11.13(b)) are very similar to those involved in reading (Figure 11.13(a)), but are used in the opposite direction. Spelling goes from hearing a word to writing it whereas reading goes from the written word to saying it. Findings What would happen if brain-damaged patients could not use the non-lexical route but the lexical route was essentially intact? They would spell familiar words accurately (whether they were regular or irregular) because the spell- ings would be available in orthographic long-term memory. However, they would have great problems with unfamiliar words and non-words having no relevant information stored in long-term memory. Such patients have phonological dysgraphia. Shelton and Weinrich (1997) studied a male patient (EA) with pho- nological dysgraphia. He spelled 50% of regular words and 45% of irreg- ular words correctly to dictation but 0% of non-words. Sotiropoulos and Hanley (2017) found phonological dysgraphics had normal performance when spelling regular and irregular words. It seems likely phonological dysgraphics have severe problems with phonological processing (processing involving word sounds).

(2010) found children with phonological dysgraphia performed poorly on various tests of phonological processing (e.g., deciding whether two spoken non-words sounded the same) as well as spelling non-words. What would happen if patients had damage to the lexical route and so relied mostly on the non-lexical route (converting sounds into groups of letters)? Such patients would be more accurate at spelling regular or consistent words and non-words (because the spelling can be worked out from the sound) than irregular or inconsistent words. Such patients suffer from surface dysgraphia. Macoir and Bernier (2002) studied a patient, MK, who spelled 92% of regular words correctly but only 52% of irregular words. Cholewa et al. (2010) in a study discussed earlier (pp. 560–561) found children with surface dysgraphia spelled 56% of irregular words incorrectly but only 19% of non- words. According to the dual-route theory, surface dysgraphics should not have severe problems with phonological processing. Cholewa et al. obtained partial support for this prediction – surface dysgraphics had impaired on some phonological tasks but on fewer tasks than phonological dysgraphics. Some research findings indicate the dual-route theory is oversimplified. First, Treiman and Kessler (2016) asked participants to spell monosyllabic non-words. Whether a final /f/ sound in these non-words was spelt f or ff did not depend solely on sound-to-spelling rules as predicted by the theory. Spellings were also influenced by context – the spelling ff was more likely to be used when the preceding vowel in the non-word was spelt with one letter rather than two. Second, Rapp et al. (2002) found greater interaction between the lexical and non-lexical routes during word spelling than assumed by the theory. They studied LAT, a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. He spelled bouquet as BOUKET and knowledge as KNOLIGE. These spellings suggest some use of the non-lexical route. In addition, however, he could only have known that bouquet ends in t and that knowledge starts with k by using information in orthographic long-term memory. Third, according to the theory, the spelling of non-words should involve only the non-lexical route. Suppose you heard the non-word /vi:m/ and wrote it down. Would you write VEAM or VEME? Most spellers write VEAM if dream has just been presented auditorily but VEME if preceded by theme (Martin & Barry, 2012). This shows an influence of the lexical route on non-word spellings. Evaluation Evidence from phonological dysgraphics and surface dysgraphics provides reasonable evidence spelling can involve a lexical or non-lexical route. There is also evidence for interactions between the two routes. What are the limitations of the two-route theory? (1) The theory assumes phonological dysgraphics have a specific problem turning sounds into groups of letters. In fact, they often have a more general problem with phonological processing.

This has been found with respect to the spell- ing of words and non-words. (3) The theory is oversimplified because we use more sources of infor- mation in spelling than identified theoretically. As Treiman (2017, p. 84) pointed out, “English spelling includes more regularities than is often thought.” For example, double consonants are common before a final (e.g., haddock; paddock) but uncommon before a final (e.g., tannic vs panic, magic, tragic). Treiman discussed research showing we use such information to increase the accuracy of our word spellings. One or two orthographic lexicons? Look back to Figure 11.13 and you will see many similarities between reading and spelling. Of most relevance here, knowledge of word spell- ings (orthography) is important in reading and writing. The simplest (and most plausible) assumption is that there is a single orthographic lexicon within orthographic long-term memory used for reading and spelling. Alternatively, an input orthographic lexicon is used in reading and a separ- ate output orthographic lexicon is used in spelling. Findings Relevant evidence has come from studies on brain-damaged patients. Patients with a reading impairment (dyslexia) generally also have impaired writing and spelling (dysgraphia). In many cases, such patients have prob- lems with the same specific words in reading and writing. The above findings suggest there is a single orthographical lexicon. However, some brain-damaged patients have greater problems with reading than spelling, or vice versa. Such evidence suggests there are two orthographic lexicons. However, those with greater reading prob- lems generally have damage to brain areas associated with visual percep- tion (e.g., BA17/18), whereas those with greater spelling problems have damage to premotor areas (e.g., BA6) (Rapp & Lipka, 2011). These findings reflect the greater role of perception in reading and of motor processes in spelling and so they do not indicate whether there are two orthographic lexicons. Hepner et al. (2017) studied PJT (an 8-year-old boy with dysgraphia) and obtained the following findings: “We found no evidence of any reading impairment . . . indicating a striking dissociation between impaired spelling and superior reading.” Hanley and Sotiropoulos (2018) obtained similar findings with NR. He had no problems in reading words with atypical sound–letter associations but performed very poorly when required to spell such words. The above findings may suggest there are two orthographic lexicons, with the one associated with spelling being severely impaired in PJT and NR. However, this interpretation is implausible. It is more likely PJT has one orthographic lexicon but finds it hard to access the information in it via phonological long-term memory (as is required during spelling).

In essence, she found that the brain areas associated with writing correspond closely to those involved in reading and in letter perception (see Figure 11.14). Purcell et al. (2017) assessed activation in areas associated with orthographic processing (the ventral occipito-temporal cortex and infe- rior frontal gyrus) while participants read visually presented words or spelled spoken words. These areas were involved in both reading and spelling. When the same word was read on one trial and then spelled on the next trial (or vice versa), there was reduced activation in brain areas involved in orthographic processing These findings provide strong evi- dence there is a single orthographic lexicon used on reading and spelling tasks. Evaluation The issue of one vs two orthographic lexicons has not been fully resolved. However, most evidence from brain-damaged patients and from neuro- imaging studies on healthy individuals favours the notion of a single orthographic lexicon. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, much evidence is inconclusive. For example, individuals such as PJT and NR have severely impaired spelling ability. This may occur because they have a deficient orthographic lexicon for spelling or because they have problems accessing the orthographic lexicon when presented with word sounds. Second, the fact that children are often taught reading and spelling as separate skills suggests some caution before rejecting the notion of two orthographic lexicons.

Speaking and writing rely on the same knowledge base and involve similar planning skills. However, spoken language is simpler and less formal than written language because speakers have less time for planning than writers, and because speech fulfils a social function. • Basic aspects of speech production. Speech production involves several brain areas (and cognitive processes) overlapping with those involved in speech perception. The finding that individuals with mild cognitive impairment have poor speech quality indicates that speech production is demanding. It is demanding in part because limited short-term memory means speakers have to make rapid decisions while planning and producing utterances. Speech production involves four stages: semantic; syntactic; morphological; and phonological. • Speech planning. Speech planning can extend over a phrase or over a clause. The extent of advance speech planning often differs at the semantic, syntactic and phonological levels. Forward planning is generally more extensive when speakers have no time pressure, when they speak slowly and when they are under low cognitive load. Overall, speakers can choose flexibly whether to focus on effective and error-free communication or on minimising cognitive demands. • Speech errors. The study of speech errors can provide insights into the processes (e.g., planning) underlying speech production. Speech errors including spoonerisms, Freudian slips, semantic substitutions, exchange errors and subject-verb agreement errors. Perceptual loop theory argues that speakers use the comprehension system to monitor their inner and overt speech for errors. In contrast, conflict-based monitoring theory argues that error detection depends primarily on the speech- production system combined with cognitive control processes. Speakers monitor their inner and overt speech. Most such monitoring probably involves the speech-production system and cognitive control processes rather than the comprehension system. • Theories of speech production. According to Dell’s spreading- activation theory, the processing associated with speech production is parallel and interactive. The theory accounts for most speech errors but may exaggerate processing interactivity. WEAVER++ is a discrete, feedforward model based on the assumption of serial processing. Patterns of brain activation provide some support for this model, as does some research on the tip-of-the-tongue state. However, speech production often involves more interactive and parallel processing than assumed Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","evidence":["tem Writing system Interactive feature: Primal Pictures’ 3D atlas of the brain Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01.","564 Language CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction."]}

In addition, the model exaggerates the role of comprehension processes in the detection of one’s own speech errors. Various theorists (e.g., Christiansen & Chater, 2016) argue (with supporting evidence) that general cognitive processes (e.g., short-term memory; cognitive control) play a major role in speech production. These general processes are de-emphasised within spreading-activation theory and WEAVER++. • Cognitive neuropsychology: speech production. There is a traditional distinction between Broca’s aphasia (slow, ungrammatical and non-fluent speech) and Wernicke’s aphasia (fluent speech often lacking meaning) involving damage to different brain areas. The anatomical definitions of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas are unclear, and numerous other brain areas are also crucial in language processing. Anomia (impaired naming ability) can involve semantic impairments or phonological impairments, but interactions are sometimes found between semantic and phonological processing. Patients with agrammatism produce sentences lacking grammatical structure and with few function words. They have impaired processing resources, and general problems with sequence learning. The speech of jargon aphasics is reasonably grammatical. However, they produce many neologisms mostly due to deficient phonological processing. Jargon aphasics’ production of jargon occurs in part because they have deficient self-monitoring of their own speech. We can avoid an overreliance on categories such as anomia, agrammatism and jargon aphasia by focusing on empirical similarities and differences in patterns of language impairments among aphasic patients. • Speech as communication. The key purpose of speech is communication, and speakers are often sensitive to the needs of their listener. They also often make use of the common ground shared with the listener, but its use is subject to speakers’ memory limitations as well as their processing limitations. Speakers use gestures in flexible ways that are generally responsive to the listener. However, speakers make gestures even when the listener cannot see those gestures, because the use of gestures facilitates speakers when planning what to say. Other ways speakers facilitate communication are by using prosodic cues (e.g., rhythm; stress) and discourse markers (words or phrases indirectly assisting the listener’s comprehension). • Writing: the main processes. Writing involves proposing or planning, translating, transcribing, and evaluating and revising the text that has been produced. Shifts from one writing process to another depend on a monitor or control system. Good writers use a knowledge-transforming rather than knowledge-telling strategy and devote more time to revision.

The working memory system (especially the central executive) is heavily involved in the writing process. Word processing often enhances writing quality, probably by encouraging revision and thinking processes. • Spelling. According to the two-route theory, there are separate lexical and non-lexical routes in spelling, with the former used to spell familiar words and the latter unfamiliar words and non- words. Phonological dysgraphics have damage to the lexical route whereas surface dysgraphics have damage to the non-lexical route. The theory is oversimplified: phonological dysgraphics often have general problems with phonological processing and the two routes often interact. Reading and spelling probably both involve a single orthographic lexicon. However, the evidence is complex and hard to interpret. FURTHER READING Chater, N., McCauley, S.M. & Christiansen, M.H.

The ways we think (and reason and make decisions) are very varied. They range from solving newspaper crossword puzzles, to troubleshooting (or not!) if our car breaks down, to developing a new theory of the universe. Below we consider two examples of the activities to which we apply the term “thinking”. First, a fragment of Molly Bloom’s sleeping thoughts in James Joyce’s Ulysses (1922/1960, pp. 871–872): God help the world if all women in the world were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope I’ll never be like her a wonder she didn’t want us to cover our faces but she was a well educated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her. Second, here is the first author struggling to use PowerPoint: Why has the Artwork put the title in the wrong part of the slide? Suppose I try to put a frame around it so I can drag it up to where I want it? Ah ha, now if I just summon up the arrows I can move the top bit up, and then I do the same with the bottom bit. If I move the bottom bit up more than the top bit, then the title will fit in okay. These two examples illustrate several general aspects of thinking. First, they both involve individuals being conscious of their thoughts. Thinking typically involves conscious awareness. There is an ongoing controversy concerning the extent to which higher-level cognitive processes such as thinking can be unconscious (see Chapter 16). Hassin (2013) claimed uncon- scious processes can perform all the functions of conscious processes. However, the evidence suggests unconscious processes are much more PART IV Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["avoid or correct production errors.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-16 03:16:01."]}

Note also that we tend to be aware of the products of thinking rather than processes themselves (see Chapter 16). Furthermore, even when we can introspect on our thoughts, our recollections of them are often inaccurate. Joyce reconstructs well the nature of idle, associative thought in Molly Bloom’s internal monologue. However, if we asked her to tell us her thoughts from the previous five minutes, she would probably recall very little of it. Second, thinking varies in the extent to which it is directed and controlled. It can be relatively undirected as in the case of Molly Bloom letting one thought slide into another as she is on the point of slipping into a dream. In the other example, the goal is much clearer and better defined. Third, the amount and nature of the knowledge used in different thinking tasks vary enormously. The knowledge required in the PowerPoint example is relatively limited (even though it took the first author much time to acquire it!). In contrast, Molly Bloom is making use of her vast knowledge of people and of life. The next three chapters (Chapters 12–14) are concerned with the higher- level cognitive processes involved in thinking and reasoning (see the Box, Forms of thinking, on the facing page). Of importance, we use the same cognitive system to deal with all these types of thinking and reasoning. As a result, many distinctions between different forms of thinking and reasoning are somewhat arbitrary and camouflage similarities in underlying cognitive processes. From the above viewpoint, it is unsurprising that similar brain areas are typically involved in most problem-solving and reasoning tasks (see Chapter 14). It is also worth mentioning there has recently been a major shift in research from deductive reasoning to informal reasoning because the latter is of considerably more relevance in everyday life. Informal rea- soning is closer than deductive reasoning to research on judgement and decision-making because it makes much more use of an individual’s know- ledge and experience. We will briefly describe the structure of this section. Chapter 12 is concerned primarily with the processes involved in problem solving. We discuss various types of problems (e.g., those involving insight) and there is an emphasis on the reasons why most people find it very difficult to solve certain prob- lems. There is also an emphasis on the factors involved in the development of expertise in various areas (e.g., chess playing; medical expertise). Chapter 13 deals with judgement and decision-making with an emphasis on the errors and biases that are often involved. A central theme is that most people make extensive use of heuristics (rules of thumb) that are simple to Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["es.","However, the evidence suggests unconscious processes are much more PART IV Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

Complex decision-making is also considered, as well as the role of emotional factors in decision-making. Chapter 14 deals with the major forms of reasoning (inductive, deductive and informal) and the errors to which they are prone. There is also dis- cussion of the key (but very tricky!) question, “Are humans rational?”. As you might expect, many psychologists answer that question “Yes and no”, rather than a definite “Yes” or “No”! FORMS OF THINKING Problem solving Cognitive activity that involves moving from the recognition that there is a problem through a series of steps to the solution. Most other forms of thinking involve some problem solving. Problem solving differs from decision-making in that individuals have to generate their own solutions. Decision-making Selecting one out of a number of presented options or possibilities, with the decision having personal consequences (e.g., winning or losing money). Judgement A component of decision-making that involves calculating the likelihood of various possible events; the emphasis is on accuracy. Deductive reasoning Deciding what conclusions necessarily follow provided various statements are assumed to be true; most deductive-reasoning tasks are based on formal logic; however, most individuals use informal reasoning (see below) rather than logic with such tasks (see Evans et al., 2015). Informal reasoning Evaluating the strength of arguments by taking account of one’s relevant knowledge and experience. Inductive reasoning Deciding whether certain statements or hypotheses are true on the basis of the available information. It is used by scientists and detectives but is not guaranteed to produce valid conclusions.

Here are three examples. First, you have an urgent meeting in another city. However, the trains generally run late, your car is old and unreliable, and the buses are slow. Second, you are struggling to work out the correct sequence of operations on your computer to perform a given task. You try to remember what you needed to do with your previous com- puter. Third, you are an expert chess player competing against a strong opponent. The time clock is ticking, and you must rapidly decide on your move in a complicated position. The above examples relate to the three main topics of this chapter. The first is problem solving, which involves the following (Goel, 2010, p. 613): “(1) there are two states of affairs; (2) the agent [problem solver] is in one state and wants to be in the other state; (3) it is not apparent to the agent how the gap between the two states is to be bridged; and (4) bridging the gap is a consciously guided multi-step process.” One reason problem solving is very important is because it is “a crossroads, where many dif- ferent processes come together in the service of the needs and goals of an individual” (Weisberg, 2018, p. 607). The second topic is analogical problem solving. In our everyday lives, we constantly use past experience and knowledge to assist us in our current task. Often we detect (and make effective use of) analogies or similarities between a current problem and ones solved in the past. The third topic is expertise. Individuals possessing expertise have considerable specialist knowledge in one area or domain. There is much overlap between expertise and problem solving in that experts are very effi- cient at solving numerous problems in their area of expertise. However, there are also important differences. Knowledge is typically more impor- tant in research on expertise than problem solving. In addition, there is more focus on individual differences in expertise research. Indeed, a central issue in expertise is to identify the main differences (e.g., in knowledge; in strategic processing) between experts and novices.

Chapter 12 Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n574 Thinking and reasoning PROBLEM SOLVING: INTRODUCTION There are three major aspects to problem solving: (1) It is purposeful (i.e., goal-directed). (2) It involves controlled processes and is not totally reliant on “auto- matic” processes. (3) A problem exists when someone lacks the relevant knowledge to produce an immediate solution. Thus, for example, a task involving mathematical calculation may be a problem for most individuals but not a professional mathematician. The above three aspects are typically found during problem solving. However, as we will see, problem solving sometimes depends on non- conscious processes as well as (or instead of) the conscious deliberate pro- cesses implied by aspects (1) and (2). There are major differences among problems. Well-defined problems are ones where all problem aspects are clearly specified, including the initial state or situation, the range of possible moves or strategies, and the goal or solution. The goal is well specified because it is clear when it has been reached (e.g., the centre of a maze). Chess is a well-defined problem: there is a standard initial state, the rules specify all legitimate moves and the goal is to achieve checkmate. However, chess is in some ways ill- defined – the nature of the problem faced by a chess player varies constantly during a game. Ill-defined problems are underspecified. Suppose you set yourself the goal of becoming happier. There are endless strategies you could adopt, and it is very hard to anticipate which would be most effective. Since hap- piness varies over time and is hard to define, how are you going to decide whether you have solved the problem of becoming happier? Most everyday problems are ill-defined. However, psychologists have focused mostly on well-defined problems. Why is this? With well-defined problems, the researcher knows the correct answer and often also knows the optimal strategy for their solution. As a result, they can easily identify the errors and deficiencies in problem solvers’ strategies. Goel and Grafman (2000) studied PF, a man with brain damage to the right prefrontal cortex. He had a high IQ (128) and performed successfully on well-defined laboratory tasks. However, he performed very poorly with everyday ill-defined problems because he produced inadequate preliminary plans. In similar fashion, Goel et al. (2013) found patients with damage to the right prefrontal cortex made premature commitments when planning a trip to Italy. In contrast, planning is more straightforward with most well-defined problems. We can also distinguish between knowledge-rich and knowledge-lean problems. Knowledge-rich problems (e.g., chess problems) can only be solved by those having much relevant specific knowledge. In contrast, knowledge-lean problems do not require such knowledge because the information needed to solve the problem is contained in the initial problem statement. Historically, most research involved knowledge-lean problems because they minimise individual differences in relevant knowledge. KEY TERMS Well-defined problems Problems in which the initial state, the goal and the methods available for solving them are clearly laid out. Ill-defined problems Problems in which the problem is imprecisely specified; for example, the initial state, the goal state and the methods available to solve the problem may be unclear. Knowledge-rich problems Problems that can only be solved by those having considerable relevant background knowledge. Knowledge-lean problems Problems that can be solved by individuals in the absence of specific relevant prior knowledge.

Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say, Number 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say Number 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to switch to door Number 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? If you stayed with your first choice, you are in good company since approximately 85% of people make that decision. Unfortunately, it is wrong! There is actually a two-thirds chance of being correct if you switch. Most people (including you?) furiously dispute the above answer. Let’s work it through. There are only three possible scenarios with the Monty Hall problem (Krauss & Wang, 2003; see Figure 12.1). With scenarios 1 and 2, your first choice is incorrect, and so Monty Hall opens the only remaining door with a goat behind it. As a result, switching is certain to succeed. With scenario 3, your first choice is correct, and you would win by refusing to switch. Overall, switching succeeds two-thirds of the time. Monty Hall, the game-show host. Monty Hall.

This raises the issue as to whether there is some com- monality in the processes used to solve these diverse problems. Bartley et al. (2018) addressed this issue in a meta-analysis (see Glossary) of neuro- imaging studies involving mathematical, verbal and visuo-spatial problems. Bartley et al. (2018) identified what they called “a core problem solving network” (p. 318) that was common to all three types of problem (see Figure 12.2(d)). More specifically, there was a fronto-parietal network (e.g., the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; the cingulate gyrus involved in processes such as attention, monitoring and working memory). In addition, there were brain areas specific to mathematical, verbal and visuo-spatial prob- lems (see Figure 12.2). GESTALT APPROACH AND BEYOND: INSIGHT AND ROLE OF EXPERIENCE Early research on problem solving was dominated by the gestaltists, German psychologists flourishing between the 1920s and 1940s. They dis- tinguished between reproductive and productive thinking. Reproductive thinking involves the systematic re-use of previous experiences (e.g., in Human performance on the Monty Hall problem is very poor. Indeed, Herbranson and Schroeder (2010) found it was much worse than that of pigeons! After extensive practice, humans switched on 66% of trials (the optimal response) whereas pigeons switched on 96% of trials. The pigeons performed well because they simply maximised the reward they received whereas humans used more complex strategies. Why do humans perform so poorly on this problem? First, people typically use a heuristic (rule of thumb) known as the equiprobability bias (assuming all available options are equally likely even when they are not; Tubau et al., 2015). In addition, people experience more regret when losing by switching than when losing by staying (Tubau et al.). These two factors lead most people to stay, mistakenly. Second, the problem places substantial demands on the central executive (an attention-like system; see Glossary). Performance on the Monty Hall problem was much worse if participants per- formed a demanding task involving the central executive at the same time (8% vs 22%; De Neys & Verschueren, 2006). Third, many people mistakenly believe the host’s actions are random. Burns and Wieth (2004) made the causal structure of the problem clearer. There are three boxers, one of whom is so good he is certain to win any bout. You select one boxer and then the other two fight each other. The winner of this bout then fights the boxer you selected initially. You win if you choose the winner of this second bout. With this version of the problem, 51% correctly decided to switch versus only 15% with the standard three-door problem. This occurred because it is easy to see that the boxer who won the first bout did so because of skill rather than any random factor. Fourth, it is very hard to understand the problem. Saenen et al. (2015) found 16% of university students produced the optimal answer (i.e., switching) but only half understood the underlying probabilities. For example, the probabilities of winning-when-staying and winning-when-switching must equal 1 but several participants produced probabilities that did not sum to 1! Thus, it is possible to “solve” the Monty Hall problem without full understanding. When participants are pro- vided with relevant information about the underlying probabilities, over 80% of them decided to switch compared to only 40% when that information was not provided (James et al., 2018).

Productive thinking involves novel problem restructuring and is mostly required on ill-defined problems. In what follows, our main focus will be on theorising and research influenced by the Gestalt approach with only occa- sional mentions of the gestaltists’ original research. Insight The gestaltists argued problems requiring pro- ductive thinking are often solved using insight. Insight involves a sudden problem restructur- ing, often accompanied by an “Aha! experi- ence”. More technically, insight is “any sudden comprehension, realisation, or problem solu- tion that involves a reorganisation of the ele- ments of a person’s mental representation of a stimulus, situation, or event to yield a non-obvious or non-dominant interpretation” (Kounios & Beeman, 2014, p. 74). The mutilated draughtboard (or chequer- board) problem (see Figure 12.3) is an insight problem. The board is initially covered by 32 dominoes occupying two squares each. Then two squares are removed from diagonally KEY TERM Insight The experience of suddenly realising how to solve a problem; sometimes referred to as the “the Aha! experience”.

Nearly everyone starts by mentally covering squares with dominoes. Alas, this strategy is ineffective because there are 758,148 possible permu- tations! You may well rapidly solve the problem using insight if we tell you something you already know – each domino covers one white and one black square. If that does not work, note that the two removed squares must have the same colour. Thus, the 31 dominoes cannot cover the muti- lated board. There is theoretical controversy concerning insight. Some (including the gestaltists) claim it is very different from other cognitive processes (the special-process viewpoint). However, others claim very similar processes are used in insight and non-insight problems (the business-as-usual view- point) (Zander et al., 2016). Below we discuss this controversy. Findings Researchers often use participants’ reports of the Aha! experience to indi- cate insight. Ideally, the Aha! experience should be reported predominantly on “insight problems” rather than “non-insight problems” and should be associated with correct solutions. The evidence partially supports these predictions. Webb et al. (2016a) found Aha! experiences were reported more often with insight than non- insight or problems. However, insight problems were sometimes solved without any Aha! experiences and the solution of non-insight problems was sometimes accompanied by Aha! experiences. The gestaltists apparently assumed insight always produces correct solutions. Danek and Wiley (2017) reported contrary evidence using insight problems. Many incorrect solutions (especially those produced rapidly) were associated with Aha! experiences. Much research has considered whether insight is associated with a spe- cific pattern of brain activity (Kounios & Beeman, 2014). The findings are variable. Bowden et al. (2005) used the Remote Associates Test: three words were presented (e.g., fence; card; master) and participants thought of a word (e.g., post) going with each one to form compound words. The anterior superior temporal gyrus was activated only when solutions involved insight. This is a brain area associated with processing distant semantic relations between words as well as reinterpretation and semantic integration. Other areas associated with insight are the anterior cingulate cortex (involved in the detection of cognitive conflict and the breaking of a mindset) and the prefrontal cortex (involved in higher cognitive processes (Kounios & Beeman, 2014). Metcalfe and Wiebe (1987) assessed participants’ feelings of “warmth” (closeness to solution) during insight and non-insight problems. Warmth increased progressively during non-insight problems (as expected because they involve several processes). With insight problems, warmth ratings remained low until suddenly increasing dramatically just before problem solution (consistent with the Aha! experience). Kizilirmak et al. (2018) reported similar findings using the Remote Associates Test (discussed above). Feelings of warmth increased much more abruptly for problems KEY TERM Remote Associates Test This involves finding a word that is related to three given words (e.g., opera, hand and dish are all related to soap).

Subjectively, insight occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. However, this is not necessarily true of the underlying processes. Ellis et al. (2011) recorded eye movements while participants solved four-letter anagrams (five letters were presented but one was a distractor). On insight trials, par- ticipants reported suddenly finding the solution to the problem. However, participants had decreasing fixations on the distractor letter ahead of the solution indicating they were gradually, but unconsciously, accumulating relevant knowledge. In sum, insight is a process differing from other, more controlled processes. However, there are issues with respect to the measurement of insight. For example, Laukkonen and Tangen (2018) found problem solvers often report the Aha! experience in the absence of a sudden increase in warmth ratings and vice versa. The Aha! experience is a preferable measure of insight because it is more consistently associated with various objective measures (e.g., problem-solving strategies; performance accuracy on insight problems) (see Laukkonen & Tangen). Of relevance, the Aha! experience is associated with increased autonomic arousal (Shen et al., 2018) indicating an emotional reaction to insightful problem solving. Representational change theory Ohlsson (1992, 2011) developed the gestaltist approach in his representa- tional change theory. According to this theory, the initial stage of problem solving involves forming a mental representation of the problem. After that, we access various mental operators that might be applied to this representation, only one of which is selected and used at any given time. More specifically, the current mental representation causes activation to spread to mental operators related to it in meaning via an unconscious process and the mental operator most strongly activated is retrieved. We often encounter an impasse (feeling blocked and unsure how to proceed) when solving a problem because our mental representation of it is incorrect. Theoretically, we must change (or restructure) the problem representation for insight to occur. This can happen in three ways: (1) Constraint relaxation: inhibitions on what is regarded as permissible are removed. (2) Re-encoding: some aspect of the problem representation is re inter - preted. (3) Elaboration: new problem information is added to the representation. Őllinger et al. (2014) developed representational change theory (see Figure 12.4). What is new is the assumption that a search process may be neces- sary even after an impasse has been overcome by insight. For example, consider the nine-dot problem which requires four straight lines that go through all nine dots (see Figure 12.5). Most people initially assume the line must remain within the confines of the square formed by the dots. Even when this constraint is relaxed by explicitly instructing participants that they can draw lines outside the square, performance is still poor.

Findings Earlier we discussed the mutilated chessboard problem on which nearly everyone starts with an incorrect problem representation. Solving it requires representing each domino as an object covering one white and one black square ( re-encoding) and representing the chessboard as having lost two black (or white) squares (elaboration). Knoblich et al. (1999) showed the importance of constraint relaxation using matchstick problems involving Roman numerals (see Figure 12.6). The solution to each problem requiring moving a single stick to produce a true statement to replace the initial false one. Some problems (Type A) only required changing two values in the equation (e.g., VI = VII + I [6 = 7 + 1] becomes VII = VI + I [7 = 6 + 1]). In contrast, Type B problems involved a less obvious change in the representation of the equation (e.g., IV = III – I [4 = 3 – 1] becomes IV – III = I [4 – 3 = 1]). According to Knoblich et al. (1999), we have learned that many opera- tions change the values (numbers) in an equation (as in Type A problems). In contrast, relatively few operations change the operators (i.e., +, – and =) as required in Type B problems. As predicted, participants found it much harder to relax the normal constraints of arithmetic (and so show insight) with Type B problems. Knoblich et al. (2001) reported further evidence that participants’ initial representation is based on the assumption that values must be changed. Participants initially spent much more time fixating the values than the operators with both types of problems. Figure 12.4 Flow chart of insight problem solving. Initially, a problem representation is established using prior knowledge and perceptual processes. The problem representation is searched by heuristics (rules of thumb). If this proves unsuccessful, an impasse is encountered. This leads to a change in the problem representation and this new representation is also searched by heuristics. This process is continued until a solution is found or the problem is abandoned. Figure 12.5 (a) The nine-dot problem and (b) its solution.

(1999) and the cumulative solution rates produced for these types of problems in their study. © American Psychological Association. Reverberi et al. (2005) argued that processing constraints on insight problems involve the lateral prefrontal cortex. Patients with damage to that area should not impose artificial constraints when solving insight problems and so might perform better than healthy controls. As predicted, brain-damaged patients solved 82% of the hardest matchstick arithmetic problems compared to only 43% of controls. According to representational change theory, solution hints should be most useful when individuals have just reached an impasse or block. At that point, they have formed an incorrect problem representation but have not become excessively fixated on it. Moss et al. (2011) obtained findings consistent with this prediction. Fleck and Weisberg (2013) asked participants to think aloud while solving insight problems. There were large individual differences in their strategies. Evidence of impasse and restructuring (of crucial importance according to representational change theory) was obtained on only 25% of problem attempts. Other successful strategies included direct applications of knowledge with no representational change and use of simple heuris- tics or rules of thumb (e.g., hill climbing, see Glossary). Overall, there was much less evidence of impasse and restructuring when solutions were pro- duced rapidly rather than slowly. Fedor et al. (2015) reported various findings inconsistent with rep- resentational change theory in a study on solving an insight problem. First, less than 50% of problem solvers followed the theoretically predicted sequence of constrained search, impasse, insight, extended search and solution. Most used more complex processing sequences with search and impasse occurring several times. Second, Fedor et al. compared reported experiences of impasse with behaviourally defined measures (i.e., repeti- tious behaviour; inactivity). Problem solvers were no more likely to report experiencing an impasse during a behaviourally defined impasse than at other stages of processing. In sum representational change theory provides a more explicit and testable account than the original Gestalt theory. However, it is increasingly clear that problem solving on insight problems is significantly more flexible and variable than assumed by that theory.

More generally, it involves a fruitful combination of Gestalt ideas with cognitive psychology. Öllinger et al.’s (2014) extension of this theory has improved it by empha- sising that efficient search processes are often needed after as well as before an impasse leading to insight. What are the theory’s limitations? First, the theory provides an ideal- ised account of the processes involved in insight problems. There are substantial individual differences in problem processing, and processing sequences are often more complex and flexible than assumed theoretically. Second, we often cannot predict when (or why) problem solvers change a problem’s representation. Third, there is often surprisingly little evidence of restructuring or impasse when individuals solve insight problems. Fourth, the strategies used to solve insight problems include some (e.g., direct application of knowledge; heuristics) not included within the theory. Fifth, the original IN THE REAL WORLD: MAGIC TRICKS Many magic tricks persuade spectators to focus on a strong (but incorrect) problem representation (Danek et al., 2014). For example, a magician pours water from a glass into an empty mug. He then turns the mug upside down and a large ice cube drops out (see YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B6ZxNROuNw). This trick works because most people assume the mug is empty. In fact, there is a white napkin glued to the bottom of the mug and the ice cube. The water is fully absorbed by the napkin and so only the ice cube falls out. Participants given a verbal cue to relax the incor- rect assumption that the mug was empty had improved performance. Spectators often cannot change their initial incorrect problem representation into the correct one. Our perceptual system rapidly and unconsciously extrapolates from the visible parts of objects to complete them (the Gestalt law of closure shown in Figure 3.4) (Ekroll et al., 2017). For example, consider the Chinese linking rings trick in which solid metal rings appear to link and unlink by passing through each other. One ring has a small gap in it, but spectators assume all the rings are complete. The multiplying billiard balls trick also depends on visual completion (see Figure 12.7). The con- juror starts with a single ball and then progressively adds balls until they have four: the initial ball is a hollow shell initially having a complete ball hidden in it. When that second ball is revealed, the conjuror inserts another complete ball in the hollow shell and so on. When observers viewed a hollow shell balanced on the tip of their finger, they perceived a complete ball despite strong evidence it was hollow (Ekroll et al., 2016). They even perceived their own finger as shorter than usual! These findings are directly relevant to representational change theory – observers often cannot correct their incorrect problem representation because their assumption the initial ball is complete is based on powerful perceptual processes. Figure 12.7 The multiplying billiard balls trick. (a) This is the end of the trick when the initial one ball has become four balls; (b) the secret of this trick is that the initial ball is an empty semi-spherical shell that can contain another ball.

Facilitating insight: hints and incubation We can facilitate insight by providing subtle hints. Consider Maier’s (1931) pendulum problem. Participants enter a room containing various objects (e.g., poles, pliers, extension cords) plus two hanging strings (see Figure 12.8). The task involves tying the strings together, but they are too far apart for participants to reach one string while holding the other. The solution involves tying the pliers to one string and swinging it like a pendulum. Thomas and Lleras (2009) used the pendulum problem with occa- sional exercise breaks in which participants swung or stretched their arms. Those moving their arms in a solution-relevant way (i.e., swinging) were more likely to solve the problem even though unaware of the relationship between their arm movements and the task. Wallas (1926) claimed problem solving can benefit from incubation, which “arises when the solution . . . comes to mind after a temporary shift of attention to another domain” (Sio & Ormerod, 2015, p. 113). Research typically involves comparing an experimental group having an incubation period away from an unsolved problem with a control group working continuously. Sio and Ormerod (2009) reported three findings in a meta-analysis: (1) Incubation effects (generally fairly small) were reported in 73% of the studies. (2) Incubation effects were stronger with creative problems having mul- tiple solutions than linguistic and verbal problems having a single Figure 12.8 The two-string problem in which it is not possible to reach one string while holding the other.

(3) The effects were larger when there was a fairly long preparation time prior to incubation. This may have occurred because an impasse or block in thinking is more likely to develop when preparation time is long. Why is incubation beneficial? Simon (1966) argued control information relating to the strategies used by problem solvers is forgotten during incu- bation. This forgetting facilitates problem solvers adopting a new approach after the incubation period. Penaloza and Calvillo (2012) found solving insight problems was only facilitated by a 2-minute break when this allowed misleading information to be forgotten. Gilhooly (2018) focused on “unconscious work”: “Incubation effects involve active although unconscious processing of the problem materials.” His approach is supported by research on insight problems using two con- ditions: (1) the task instructions immediately precede each problem; (2) a totally irrelevant task is performed between instructions and the problem. Performance is typically better in condition (2) than condition (1). This can be explained by unconscious work but not forgetting previously used strategies or information. Past experience: mental set Past experience generally increases our ability to solve problems. However, the gestaltists argued persuasively we sometimes fail to solve problems because we are misled by our past experience. For example, mental set (Einstellung in German) involves continuing to use a previously successful problem-solving strategy even when inappropriate or suboptimal. However, mental set is often useful – it allows successive problems of the same type to be solved rapidly, with few processing demands. Luchins (1942) investigated mental set using problems that involved three water jars of varying capacity. Here is a sample problem. Jar A can hold 28 quarts of water, Jar B 76 quarts and Jar C 3 quarts. You must end up with exactly 25 quarts in one of the jars. The solution is easy: Jar A is filled, and then Jar C is filled from it, leaving 25 quarts in Jar A. Of partic- ipants previously given similar problems, 95% solved it. Other participants had previously been trained on problems all having the same complex three-jar solution (fill Jar B and use the contents to fill Jar C twice and Jar A once). Of these participants, only 36% solved the easy final problem! Vallée-Tourangeau et al. (2011) found the damaging effects of mental set on Luchins’ water-jar problems were reduced when actual water jars were used rather than presenting the problems on paper (as in the original research). According to Vallee-Tourangeau et al., the actual water jars pro- vided a “rich and dynamic . . . perceptual input” (p. 1894). Thomas and Didierjean (2016) showed some powerful effects of mental set. Participants saw a central card surrounded by six cards (all face down). A magician asked them to select one of the six cards, which was then revealed to match the central card. Participants were asked to identify the trick’s secret (all the cards are the same). When the magician did not KEY TERM Mental set The tendency to use a familiar problem-solving strategy that has proved successful in the past even when it is no longer appropriate; also known as Einstellung.

However, when he claimed he could influence participants’ choice by a specific hand move, only 13% of participants solved the trick! Thus, mental set is so strong that a single exposure to an implausible solution can inhibit finding the actual (and more obvious) solution. We might assume experts given a problem in their area of expertise would be relatively unaffected by mental set. Bilalić et al. (2008a) tested this assumption with chess experts. Most failed to identify the shortest way to win a chess game, using instead a longer solution based on a familiar strategy. However, the most skilful players were least likely to be impaired by mental set. Why are chess experts susceptible to the damaging effects of mental set? Bilalić et al. (2008b) studied chess experts who had found the familiar solution but were seeking a better one. They still fixated features of the chessboard position related to the familiar solution. Thus, their attention was still partly controlled by processes producing the initial familiar solu- tion even though they were unaware this was the case. In sum, mental set often impairs problem solving. Gobet (2016) argued that its negative effects are very widespread. For example, mental set can lead scientists to ignore findings inconsistent with their favourite theory (see Chapter 14). It is also relevant to myside bias (see Glossary) which involves people disregarding arguments disproving their beliefs (see Chapter 14). Past experience: functional fixedness We turn now to a specific form of mental set: functional fixedness. Functional fixedness occurs when we mistakenly assume any given object has only a limited number of familiar uses. Duncker (1945) carried out a classic study on functional fixedness. Participants were given a candle, a book of matches, tacks in a box and several other objects (see Figure 12.9). Their task was to attach the candle to a wall by the table, so that it did not drip onto the table below. Most participants tried to nail the candle directly to the wall or glue it to the wall by melting it. Only a few produced the correct answer – use the inside of the tack box as a candle holder and then nail it to the wall with tacks. According to Duncker (1945), his partic- ipants “fixated” on the tack box’s function as a container rather than a platform. More correct solutions were produced when the box containing the tacks was empty at the start of the experiment because it appeared less like a container. More direct evidence that past experi- ence can produce functional fixedness was reported by Ye et al. (2009). Participants decided whether objects could be used for a specific function (e.g., packable with – usable as packing material to pack an egg in a box). Immediately afterwards, they decided whether KEY TERM Functional fixedness The inflexible focus on the usual function(s) of an object in problem solving.

Some objects (e.g., ski cap; pillow) could be used for both functions. Deciding an object possessed the first function reduced the probability of detecting it also possessed the second function: this is functional fixedness. It is often assumed we are inflexible in our perceived uses of objects. Wagman et al. (2016) disputed this assumption. Rods with several added plastic pieces were regarded as more suitable for striking than poking an object. However, such rods were not regarded as suitable for striking with precision although they were suitable for striking with power. How can we overcome functional fixedness? Challoner (2009) studied 1,001 important inventions and solutions to insight problems. Two steps were typically involved: (1) Focus on an infrequently noticed or new feature. (2) Form a solution based on that obscure feature. McCaffrey (2012) argued crucial obscure features are ignored because people focus on the typical functions of objects based on their shape, size, material they were made of, and so on. This functional fixedness can be reduced by the generic-parts technique: (1) generate function-free descrip- tions of all object parts; (2) decide whether each description implies a use. McCaffrey gave some participants training in the generic-parts technique. These participants solved 83% of insight problems (e.g., Duncker’s candle problem) compared to only 49% in the control group. Cognitive control: its role in insight, functional fixedness and mental set Cognitive control refers to “the ability to limit attention to goal- relevant information and inhibit, or suppress, irrelevant distraction” (Amer et al., 2016b, p. 905). It is greater in individuals high in working memory capacity (which is related to attentional control; see Glossary). We might expect a high level of cognitive control to be advantageous on tasks involving insight, functional fixedness or mental set. However, that is not always the case. Cognitive control is associated with a narrow focus of attention on goal-relevant information and specific task strategies coupled with an inhi- bition of processing of other information sources (Amer et al., 2016b). Thus, high cognitive control can impair performance when a broad focus of attention would be beneficial. Findings Pope et al. (2015) compared the ability to break a mental set in human adults, children and baboons. The original task was as follows: (1) pres- entation of two red squares followed by participants touching the locations previously occupied by those red squares: (2) if this was done correctly, a blue triangle was presented and had to be touched for reward. After partic- ipants had established a mental set, the task changed slightly – the blue tri- angle was present throughout.

Pope et al. (2015) found 100% of baboons successfully broke the mental set, as did 45% of children but only 12% of adults! Thus, the ability to break the mental set was inversely related to intelligence (and cognitive control). Baboons probably broke the mental set because that involved much less processing capacity than the original strategy. Human adults did not break the set because they found it hard to believe the task could be as easy as simply touching the blue triangle. DeCaro et al. (2016) compared the performance of individuals who were high and low in working memory capacity (resembling attentional control) on Knoblich et al.’s (1999) matchstick arithmetic problems. Some required insight (e.g., the Type B problem shown in Figure 12.6) whereas others did not (e.g., the Type A problem shown in Figure 12.6). Participants high in working memory capacity performed better than those low in working memory capacity scorers on problems not requiring insight (see Figure 12.10). However, the opposite was the case with insight problems. How can we explain the above findings? Individuals high in working memory capacity tend to consider complex problem solutions even when simple ones are required (DeCaro et al., 2016, 2017). This disadvantages high-capacity individuals on many insight problems. However, high- capacity individuals are often better than low-capacity ones at forming an initial problem representation and this facilitates their performance of many non-insight problems. Jarosz et al. (2012) considered the effects of alcohol intoxication on an insight task (Remote Associates Test; see Glossary). Intoxicated partic- ipants solved 58% of the problems compared to only 42% for sober par- ticipants.

(2013) assessed the role of cognitive control in func- tional fixedness when participants generated common or uncommon uses for objects. When transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) was applied to the left prefrontal cortex to reduce cognitive control, this facil- itated performance when uncommon uses for objects had to be produced. Conclusions High cognitive control can impair performance on certain tasks, especially those “that are aided by the use of previously irrelevant information, or on tasks that generally benefit from drawing on diverse bits of information from various sources” (Amer et al., 2016b, p. 906). However, high cognitive control is advantageous on tasks requiring working memory and/or selec- tive attention, and when distracting stimuli must be ignored. It remains for the future to establish precisely which tasks benefit from (or are impaired by) high cognitive control and to obtain a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms. PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES Major landmarks in problem-solving research were an article by Newell et al. (1958) followed in 1972 by Newell and Simon’s book, Human Problem Solving. Their central insight was that the strategies we use when tackling complex problems reflect our limited ability to process and store informa- tion. More specifically, we have very limited short-term memory capacity and so complex information processing is typically serial (one process at a time). These assumptions were included in their General Problem Solver (a computer program designed to solve well-defined problems). Gobet and Lane (2015) evaluated this theoretical approach. On the pos- itive side, the General Problem Solver was one of the first problem-solving programs and led to Newell and Simon being identified as “the founding fathers of artificial intelligence” (Gobet & Lane, 2015, p. 141). In addition, Newell and Simon (1972) identified several important problem- solving strategies (discussed below). Limitations include exaggerating the role of serial processing in problem solving and the reliance on rather abstract and artificial problems. Newell and Simon (1972) used various well-defined, knowledge-lean problems (e.g., the Tower of Hanoi; see Figure 12.11). The initial problem state consists of up to five discs piled in decreasing size on the first of three pegs. When they are on placed in the same order on the last peg, the problem has been solved. Only one disc can be moved at a time and a larger disc cannot be placed on top of a smaller one. Newell and Simon (1972) identified a problem space for each problem. A problem space consists of the initial problem state, the goal state, all possible mental operators (e.g., moves) that can be applied to any state to change it into a different state, and all the inter- mediate problem states.

According to Newell and Simon (1972), we rely heavily on heuristics (see Glossary) – rules of thumb that are easy to use and often produce reasonably accurate answers. Heuristics can be contrasted with algorithms (computational methods guaranteed to produce a problem solution). Algorithms are often too complex to be used by most people. In this section, we consider some heuristics identified by Newell and Simon (1972). We also discuss other heuristics and strategies for problem solving. Hill climbing Newell and Simon (1972) identified the hill-climbing heuristic. Hill climbing is a very simple strategy which involves changing the present problem state into one closer to the goal. It is mostly used when the problem solver has no clear understanding of the problem structure and so focuses on very short- term goals. Use of hill climbing resembles a climber who tried to reach the highest mountain peak in the area by using the strategy of always moving upwards. This may work. However, the climber will probably find himself/ herself trapped on a hill several valleys away from the highest peak. Means–ends analysis According to Newell and Simon (1972), the most important heuristic method is means–ends analysis. It resembles hill climbing but the problem solver has greater awareness of how to break the problem down into sub-problems. Here is the essence of means–ends analysis: ● Note the difference between the current problem state and the goal state. ● Form a subgoal to reduce the difference between the current and goal states. ● Select a mental operator (e.g., move or moves) that permits attainment of the subgoal. Means–ends analysis typically assists problem solution. However, Sweller and Levine (1982) found it can severely impair performance. Participants tried to solve an apparently simple maze, most of which was not visible. Some participants could see the goal state (goal-information group) whereas others could not. Use of means–ends analysis requires knowledge of goal location and so only the goal-information group could use that heuristic. However, the problem was designed so that means–ends analysis would not be useful – every correct move involved turning away from the goal. Only 10% of participants in this group solved the problem in 298 moves whereas those in the other group solved the problem in an average 38 moves. Meta-reasoning Ackerman and Thompson (2017) emphasised the importance of meta- reasoning (processes that monitor our progress during problem solving KEY TERMS Algorithm A computational procedure providing a specified set of steps to problem solution; see heuristic. Hill climbing A simple heuristic used by problem solvers in which they focus on making moves that will apparently put them closer to the goal.

Problem solvers assess their rate of progress towards the goal. If progress is too slow to solve the problem within the maximum number of moves allowed, they change their strategy. MacGregor et al. (2001) gave participants the nine-dot problem (see Figure 12.5) with one line of the solution to help them. Performance was worse when partici- pants had the illusion of making progress (and so were slow to switch strategies). Payne and Duggan (2011) also studied progress monitoring. Participants received an unsolvable water-jar problem with a small or large number of possible problem states. When the problem had a small number of problem states, participants more rapidly abandoned the problem because it was easier to perceive progress towards a solution was impossible. Ackerman and Thompson (2017) discussed other aspects of meta- cognition related to progress monitoring. These include judgements of solvability, and feelings of rightness or error when problem solvers produce an answer to any given problem, all of which influence the decision as to whether to remain engaged in problem solving. Planning It is generally assumed individuals presented with a complex problem engage in preliminary planning and that this planning involves prefrontal areas associated with planning. Supportive evidence comes from patients with damage to prefrontal areas, who typically have impaired planning and problem solving (Szczepanski & Knight, 2014). Goel and Grafman (1995) found patients with prefrontal damage performed worse than healthy controls on the Tower of Hanoi task (see Figure 12.11). The patients were especially disadvantaged on a diffi- cult move involving moving away from the goal because they found it harder to plan ahead. Colvin et al. (2001) reported similar findings using water-jar problems. Patients with prefrontal damage and healthy controls used the hill-climbing strategy. However, the patients performed worse because their defi- cient planning made it harder for them to make moves conflicting with that strategy. As discussed earlier, prefrontal damage can produce planning problems in everyday life. For example, Goel et al. (2013) found patients with right prefrontal damage per- formed poorly on a real-world travel plan- ning task because their planning was too piecemeal and insufficiently comprehensive. Dagher et al. (1999) used the Tower of London task in which coloured discs must be moved one by one from an initial state to Figure 12.12 Tower of London task (two-move and five-move problems). The balls in the bottom half must be rearranged to match the arrangement in the top half. From Dagher et al. (1999). By permission of Oxford University Press.

There was increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when participants solved complex ver- sions of this task. In sum, the prefrontal cortex is important in planning on many prob- lem-solving tasks. However, many other brain areas are also involved (Szczepanski & Knight, 2014). Sequential processing stages Tasks such as the Tower of Hanoi and Tower of London require planning a sequence of moves. However, we can distinguish between plan produc- tion and plan execution. With complex tasks, only some moves are typically planned, so executing the initial plan is followed by generating a further plan and then its execution. Crescentini et al. (2012) supported the distinction between plan pro- duction and plan execution using simple versions of the Tower of Hanoi task. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more active during initial planning than plan execution. In contrast, posterior temporal areas, infe- rior frontal regions and dorsolateral premotor cortex were more activated during plan execution. Nitschke et al. (2012) obtained support for the assumption that Tower of London problems require participants to engage in problem representa- tion followed by planning. On problems placing high demands on forming a problem representation, participants alternated their gaze more often between the start and goal state. On problems imposing high demands on planning, in contrast, the last fixation of the start state was unusually prolonged. How much planning? Newell and Simon (1972) assumed problem solvers typically engage in limited planning because of the constraints of short-term memory capac- ity. Patsenko and Altmann (2010) obtained strong support using Tower of Hanoi problems. Sometimes they added, deleted or moved discs during participants’ eye movements so they were not directly aware of the change. These changes only minimally disrupted performance, strongly suggesting that the participants’ next move was triggered by the current state of the problem rather than a preformed plan. There are substantial individual differences in planning for prob- lem-solving tasks. Koppenol-Gonzalez et al. (2010) found with the Tower of London task that some participants engaged in efficient planning (con- siderable preplanning of moves and high performance). In contrast, other participants showed very little evidence of effective planning (short period of preplanning and numerous errors). Most individual differences in per- formance on this task can be explained by the single factor of planning ability (Debelak et al., 2016). The amount of planning is very flexible. Delaney et al. (2004) found little evidence of planning on water-jar problems when participants chose their preferred strategy. However, instructions to generate the com- plete solution before making any moves led to detailed planning and Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["top half.","From Dagher et al."]}

Cognitive Reflection Test A test assessing individuals’ tendencies to override intuitive (but incorrect) answers to problems. faster problem solution. Morgan and Patrick (2013) argued that increas- ing the cost of accessing important task-relevant information (the goal state) on the Tower of Hanoi task would lead to more planning. It pro- duced increased planning and also led to problems being solved in fewer moves. If planning involves deliberate processes, we would expect problem solvers to be consciously aware of it. Evidence suggesting important problem-solving processes occur below the level of conscious awareness was reported by Paynter et al. (2010) using event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary). They observed clear differences in the ERPs associated with correct and incorrect moves early in the problem when no behavioural evi- dence indicated participants were making progress. Cognitive miserliness Many theorists have proposed dual-process theories to account for perfor- mance on cognitive tasks such as judgement, decision-making and reason- ing. Evans and Stanovich (2013; see Chapter 14) reviewed these theories and identified various commonalities among them. Of particular impor- tance, the theories distinguish two processes: (1) Type 1 intuitive processes are fast and relatively effortless; and (2) Type 2 reflective processes are slow and controlled. Most dual-process theorists argue that many individuals are cogni- tive misers. A cognitive miser is someone typically economical with their time and effort on tasks requiring thinking. Cognitive misers would often respond rapidly (but sometimes incorrectly) to problems using Type 1 pro- cesses without checking their answer using Type 2 processes. The Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005), which assesses the extent to which people are cognitive misers, involves a conflict between Type 1 and Type 2 processes. Why don’t you take this very short test and then see how many of your answers are correct? IN THE REAL WORLD: COGNITIVE REFLECTION TEST (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? ___ cents.

Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half the lake? ___ days. The correct answers are 5 cents (problem 1), 5 minutes (problem 2) and 47 days (problem 3). Do not worry if you did not get them all right – only about 25% of highly intelligent individuals answer all the items cor- rectly. Most incorrect answers (10 cents; 100 minutes; and 24 days) are intuitive responses produced rapidly by individuals using Type 1 processes.

Low scorers on the Cognitive Reflection Test also perform relatively poorly on many other judgement and reasoning tasks (Toplak et al., 2014). This occurs in part because performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test correlates positively with intelligence. However, scores on the Cognitive Reflection Test predicted performance on several other tasks after the effects of intelligence were removed statistically. This finding suggests cog- nitive miserliness is found on many tasks. Travers et al. (2016) found participants ultimately giving the incorrect intuitive answer were not drawn to the correct answer at any point. This suggests they did not use Type 2 reflective processes. In contrast, partic- ipants ultimately producing the correct answer were nevertheless initially drawn to the incorrect intuitive answer suggesting they inhibited the incor- rect intuitive answer. There is overlap between the notion of cognitive miser and Newell and Simon’s (1972) focus on problem solvers’ use of heuristics (discussed earlier, p. 589). In both cases, individuals resort to simple (and often inac- curate) strategies. However, Newell and Simon assumed our limited pro- cessing capacity forces us to use heuristics. In contrast, cognitive misers use heuristics because they are reluctant to engage in effortful processing rather than because they cannot. ANALOGICAL PROBLEM SOLVING AND REASONING Here we discuss analogical problem solving. An analogy is “a comparison between two objects, or systems of objects, that highlights respects in which they are thought to be similar” (Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy, 2013). Analogies are very important – we often cope successfully with novel situa- tions by relating them to situations encountered previously. Analogical problem-solving performance correlates highly with IQ, leading Lovett and Forbus (2017, p. 60) to argue “Analogy is perhaps the cornerstone of human intelligence”. More specifically, there are close links between analogical problem solving and fluid intelligence, which “refers to the ability to reason through and solve novel problems” (Shipstead et al., 2016, p. 771). The most used test of fluid intelligence is Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Raven et al., 1998). It involves geometrical analogies and requires analogical reasoning (see Figure 12.13). Analogies have proved valuable in science. For example, the physi- cist Ernest Rutherford argued electrons revolve around the nucleus as the planets revolve around the sun. This analogy (like nearly all others) has limitations – planets in the solar system attract each other through gravita- tional force whereas electrons repel each other. Scientists working on the Mars Rover Mission used analogies when there was high uncertainty about scientific issues. Why did they use analogies? According to Chan et al. (2012, p. 1362), “Analogy supports problem solving under uncertainty by narrowing the space of possibilities to facilitate quick, approximate problem solving, reasoning, and decision making.” KEY TERMS Analogy A comparison between two objects (or between a current and previous problem) that emphasises similarities between them.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n594 Thinking and reasoning Analogical problem solving If we are to use a previous problem to solve the present one, we must detect similarities between them. Chen (2002) identified three main types of simi- larity between problems: (1) Superficial similarity: solution-irrelevant details (e.g., specific objects) are common to the two problems. (2) Structural similarity: causal relations between the main components are shared by both problems. (3) Procedural similarity: procedures (actions) for turning the solution principle into concrete operations are common to both problems. Chen (2002) gave participants a problem providing them with an analogy having structural and procedural similarity with the target problem or one having only structural similarity with it. Performance was significantly better in the former condition because those participants were more likely to find the correct procedures or actions to solve the problem. With most analogical problems, participants must first retrieve appro- priate past experience or knowledge and then adapt it to make explicit its relevance to the current problem. Gick and Holyoak (1980) found retrieval failures often underlie people’s inability to solve analogical problems. They used a problem where a patient with a malignant stomach tumour can only be saved by a special kind of ray (Duncker, 1945). However, a ray strong enough to destroy the tumour will also destroy the healthy tissue, whereas a ray that does not harm healthy tissue will be too weak to destroy the tumour. Only 10% of participants solved this problem when presented on its own. If you find the above problem puzzling, here is an analogy. A general wants to capture a fortress. However, the roads to it are mined, making it too dangerous for the entire army to march along any one of them. Figure 12.13 A problem resembling those used on the Raven’s Progressive Matrices.

The general had his army converge on the fortress at the same time by walking along several different roads. Among participants who had previously memorised the story about the general and the fortress, 80% of them solved the radiation problem when informed of its relevance. However, only 40% of them solved it when not so informed. Why did so many of Gick and Holyoak’s (1980) participants fail to make spontaneous use of the relevant, memorised story? Of relevance, there were no superficial similarities between the story and problem. In con- trast, when the story was superficially similar to the problem (it involved a surgeon using rays on a cancer), 88% of participants spontaneously recalled it when given the radiation problem (Keane, 1987). Kubricht et al. (2017) studied performance on Duncker’s (1945) radiation problem as a function of individual differences in fluid intelli- gence (see Glossary) assessed by Raven’s Progressive Matrices (discussed earlier, p. 593). Individuals high in fluid intelligence performed much better than low scorers when the radiation problem was preceded by a verbal analogy (approximately 85% vs 40%, respectively). Thus, high intelligence is a factor in facilitating effective use of analogies (discussed further later, pp. 597–598). Gick and Holyoak (1980) used the reception paradigm – participants received detailed information about a possible analogy before receiving a problem. However, individuals in everyday life generally produce their own analogies: the production paradigm. Blanchette and Dunbar (2000) confirmed that people given the reception paradigm often selected analo- gies based on superficial similarities. However, those given the production paradigm mostly produced analogies sharing structural features with the current problem. Experts (e.g., scientists) often use analogies because they provide a major source of new concepts and ways of thinking about problems. What kinds of analogies do experts use? Dunbar and Blanchette (2001) studied laboratory discussions of leading molecular biologists and immunolo- gists. When they used analogies to fix experimental problems, the previous problem was often superficially similar to the current one. When they gen- erated hypotheses, however, their analogies involved fewer superficial simi- larities and considerably more structural ones. Thus, the types of analogies used by scientists depend on their current goal. Do experts mostly use distant analogies (i.e., those linking different domains) or less distant within-domain ones? Dunbar (1995) found that 98% of analogies were within-domain when experts discussed issues with fellow experts. In contrast, more distant analogies are used when scien- tific experts communicate with less expert colleagues (Kretz & Krawczyk, 2014). This difference occurs because within-domain analogies are gener- ally more detailed and precise than distant analogies. Enhancing analogical problem solving How can we increase people’s use of analogies in analogical problem solving? There are two main approaches: (1) increasing the encoding of the underlying structure of the current problem; (2) increasing the use Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["ompletes the top 3 x 3 matrix must be selected.","From Lovett and Forbus (2017)."]}

Minervino et al. (2017) adopted the first approach. All participants were initially presented with the fortress story. Some identified the similarities and differences between Duncker’s problem and another problem with a similar structure before attempting Duncker’s problem (experimental group). Others attempted Duncker’s radiation problem on its own (control group). Experimental group participants were much more likely than control group participants to solve the radiation problem (34% vs 9%, respectively). Their performance was superior because they understood more clearly the abstract or schematic structure of the radiation problem. Trench et al. (2016) found simply instructing individuals to use anal- ogies when generating arguments to persuade a poor family to reduce its indebtedness increased their use of analogies fourfold. Other participants were instructed to use analogies drawn from areas not directly related to economic issues (e.g., health; human relations). This led to a substantial increase in arguments based on analogies (especially structural analogies). In sum, most individuals rarely produced analogies spontaneously but could easily do so when prompted. Processes in analogical reasoning So far we have focused on analogical problem solving. However, much research on analogies has involved analogical reasoning. For example, con- sider four-term analogy problems taking the form A:B::C:D (A is to B as C is to D; e.g., GLOVE:HAND::SOCK:FOOT). Participants decide whether the two-word pairs express the same relationship (i.e., is it true that glove is to hand as sock is to foot?). Alternatively, only the first three terms (i.e., A, B and C) are provided with participants supplying the fourth term (i.e., D) themselves. Why are four-term analogy problems used so often in research? They differ from analogical problem solving in that they are tightly controlled – all the necessary information is presented explicitly and there is a single correct answer. These features facilitate the task of understanding the underlying processes. Sequential processing stages Analogical reasoning involves several sequential processing stages. For example, Grossnickle et al. (2016) identified four component processes: (1) Encoding: information concerning the problem stimuli is processed. (2) Inferring: identifying a relation (i.e., similarity) between two items. (3) Mapping: identifying the overall relational pattern or rule governing the problem. (4) Applying: using the outcome of the mapping process to select the response completing the analogy. Grossnickle et al. (2016) compared the performance of high and low per- formers on tasks involving relational reasoning (including analogical Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["ing of the underlying structure of the current problem; (2) increasing the use Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","596 Thinking and reasoning of effective retrieval strategies."]}

The probabilities of successfully completing each process given the previous process had been successfully completed are shown in Figure 12.14. The inference and mapping processes were the hardest (especially for low performers). Vendetti et al. (2017) identified two major strategies used by people solving four-term analogy problems. According to project-first models, individuals first generate a rule relating the A and B terms, then they map the A and C terms, and finally they apply a rule generating D. According to alignment-mapping models, individuals first align the A and C terms, and then align the B item with the target (D item). Vendetti et al. (2017) used eye tracking to identify which strategy was used. The strategy identified by project-first models was used on 50% of trials. In contrast, the strategy identified by alignment-mapping models was used on 34% of trials. On average, reasoning performance was higher when the former strategy was used. Working memory Analogical reasoning is sufficiently complex for us to predict it requires the central executive component of the working memory system (see Glossary and Chapter 6). If so, problem-solving performance should be impaired if a secondary task involving the central executive is performed at the same time. That has been found with four-term analogies (Morrison et al., 2001) and with Raven’s Matrices problems (Rao & Baddeley, 2013). Individual differences We can increase our understanding of analogical reasoning by study- ing individual differences in reasoning ability. Much research has consid- ered the relationship between analogical reasoning and working memory capacity (the ability to process and store information at the same time; see Figure 12.14 Probability of successful encoding P(E), successful inferring given successful encoding P(I/E), successful mapping given successful inferring P(M/I), and successful applying given successful mapping for low and higher performers.

Ackerman et al. (2005) found in a meta-analysis the average cor- relation between measures of working memory capacity and performance on Raven’s Matrices (which requires analogical reasoning and involves fluid intelligence) was +.49. Shipstead et al. (2016) identified key processes associated with working memory capacity and fluid intelligence (see Figure 12.15). Most cognitive tasks (Level 3) require top-down, goal-focused executive atten- tion (Level 1). Such tasks differ in the extent to which they also require maintenance (keeping relevant information accessible) and disengagement (removing or inhibiting outdated information) (Level 2). In essence, fluid intelligence involves executive attention + disengagement whereas working memory capacity involves executive attention + maintenance. Evidence that fluid intelligence and working memory capacity both involve executive attention was reported by Clark et al. (2017). Frontal- parietal brain areas associated with executive attention were activated when participants performed tasks involving working memory or fluid intelligence. Harrison et al. (2015) obtained findings consistent with the above theoretical approach using Raven’s Matrices problems. Some problems involved a repeated-rule combination (i.e., the same rule combination as a previous problem) whereas others involved a novel-rule combination (i.e., a rule combination not previously used). Harrison et al. (2015) argued that individuals high in working memory capacity are better than those with low working memory capacity at maintaining information in memory. Accordingly, they should perform especially well on Raven’s Matrices problems with a repeated rule rela- tive to those with a novel rule. That is exactly what they found. In con- trast, individuals high in fluid intelligence (assessed by tests other than Raven’s Matrices) performed much better than those low in fluid intel- ligence regardless of whether problems involved a repeated or a novel rule.

Level 1 Executive attention/ goal state Level 2 Active processing/ focal attention Level 3 Physical environment Maintenance Disengagement To-be-performed task Top-down executive signal Top-down signal organises maintenance and disengagement around a goal. The emphasis of maintenance and disengagement in carrying out top-down goals is partially determined by the nature of the to-be- performed task. Task provides an environmental medium around which cognitive processes are organised. Some tasks place a heavier burden on maintenance, others on disengagement.

An important aspect of disengage- ment is the ability to think flexibly. With Raven’s Matrices problems, that often involves a re-representation of problem structure by making it more abstract (Lovett & Forbus, 2017). For example, consider a problem with an upward-facing arrow followed by a rightward-facing arrow and then a downward-facing arrow. Participants who re-represent these figures as an arrow rotating clockwise perform better than those who do not. Lovett and Forbus (2017, p. 83) attach great importance to re-representation: Re-representation is critical because analogies are slaves to their sym- bolic representation. If two cases happen to be represented with dif- ferent relational structure, they will fail to align, and the only way to complete the analogy will be to change the structure. In sum, successful performance on Raven’s Matrices problems requires a high level of goal-focused executive attention. In addition, it requires dis- engagement to inhibit task-irrelevant infor- mation. Key aspects of the disengagement process are flexibility and re-representation. Brain mechanisms Krawczyk (2012) reviewed research on brain-damaged patients and neuroimaging studies to identify brain areas involved in ana- logical reasoning (see Figure 12.16): (1) Occipital and parietal areas are associ- ated with visual and spatial processing, followed by extensive involvement of the prefrontal cortex. (2) Left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (centred on BA10) integrates informa- tion within analogical problems. (3) The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus are involved in inhibitory processes to prevent distrac- tion and interference. (4) The temporal lobes are involved because information about concept meanings (semantic memory) is stored there.

Krawczyk et al. (2008) argued inhibitory processes involving the prefrontal cortex (brain area 3 above) are required on such problems to avoid incorrect answers involving relevant semantic or perceptual dis- tractors. As predicted, patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex were more likely than those with damage to the temporal area to select semantic or perceptual distractors. The left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex is of central importance in analogical reasoning. Hobeika et al. (2016) conducted a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies (mostly using visuo-spatial analogies based on the Raven’s Progressive Matrices or verbal four-word analogy problems – discussed earlier, pp. 596–597). The left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was consistently activated with both visuo-spatial and verbal analogies, proba- bly because of its involvement in mapping or relational integration. Urbanski et al. (2016) studied analogical reasoning performance in patients with frontal-lobe damage. Damage to the left rostrolateral pre- frontal cortex (including BA10 and 47) was more consistently associated with impaired analogical reasoning than other frontal damage. These find- ings fit well with those of Hobeika et al. (2016). Other findings provide more direct support for the notion that the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in mapping or relational integra- tion. Green (2016) discussed his own research using verbal four-term anal- ogies (discussed earlier) varying in the difficulty of mapping or relational integration. Activity within left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex increased progressively as the demands on mapping increased. In sum, research on brain mechanisms has identified the brain areas associated with the major processes involved in analogical reasoning. The consistent finding that the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex is strongly involved when individuals solve several different analogical reasoning tasks implies (but not does prove) that these tasks involve similar cognitive processes. EXPERTISE So far we have mostly discussed studies where the time available for learn- ing was short, the tasks were relatively limited, and prior specific know- ledge was not required. In the real world, however, people often spend many years acquiring knowledge and skills in a given area (e.g., psychol- ogy; law; medicine; journalism). The end point of such long-term learning is expertise. Expertise is “elite, peak, or exceptionally high levels of perfor- mance on a particular task or within a given domain . . . An expert’s field of expertise can be almost anything from craftsmanship, through sports and music, to science or mathematics” (Bourne et al., 2015, p. 211). The development of expertise resembles problem solving in that experts are extremely efficient at solving numerous problems in their area or domain of expertise. However, most traditional research on problem solving involved “knowledge-lean” problems, requiring no special knowledge or training. In contrast, studies on expertise typically use “knowledge- rich” problems requiring much knowledge beyond that contained in the KEY TERM Expertise The high level of knowledge and performance in a given domain that an expert has achieved through years of systematic practice.

In what follows, we first consider chess expertise. There are various advantages to studying chess. First, the ELO ranking system (named after the chess master Arpad Elo) assesses chess players’ level of expertise. Second, expert chess players develop cognitive skills (e.g., pattern recog- nition; selective search) of general usefulness. Sala et al. (2017) discussed a meta-analytic review showing chess instruction improves achievement in mathematics and overall cognitive ability. Third, there are clear similari- ties between the remarkable memory for chess positions shown by chess experts and the vast knowledge experts in other domains have stored in long-term memory. We then discuss medical expertise (especially medical diagnosis), fol- lowed by a comparison of these two forms of expertise. After that, we consider the role of brain plasticity in expertise. Finally, we evaluate the hypothesis that deliberate practice is the main requirement for the devel- opment of expertise and also consider alternative theoretical approaches. CHESS-PLAYING EXPERTISE As already indicated, there are various reasons why it is valuable to study chess-playing expertise. For example, we can measure chess players’ levels of skill precisely based on their results against other players. In addition, the existence of permanent records of chess players’ tournament records over their entire career means detailed longitudinal data are available for analysis. The most obvious reason why some individuals are much better than others at playing chess is that they have devoted far more time to practice – it takes about 10,000 hours on average to become a grandmaster. Of special importance, expert chess players have much more detailed informa- tion about chess positions stored in long-term memory than non-experts. In classic research, De Groot (1965) presented chess players with brief presentations of board positions from actual games. After removing the board, they reconstructed the positions. Chess masters recalled the posi- tions much more accurately than less expert players (91% vs 43%, respec- tively). This does not reflect differences in memory ability – there were no group differences when remembering random board positions. Template theory What is the nature of the vast amount of chess-related information experts have stored in long-term memory? Gobet (e.g., Gobet & Waters, 2003) provided an influential answer in his template theory. A template is an abstract, schematic structure more general than an actual board position. Each template consists of a core (fixed information) plus slots (containing variable information about pieces and locations). Each template typically stores information relating to about ten pieces although it can be larger. Templates’ possession of slots makes them adaptable and flexible in use. Templates are built up out of small memory structures known as chunks (see Glossary). KEY TERM Template As applied to chess, an abstract schematic structure consisting of a mixture of fixed and variable information about chess pieces and positions.

Case study: Eye movements of expert chess players Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n602 Thinking and reasoning Here are the main predictions of template theory: (1) Chess positions are stored in three templates, some of which are large. (2) Outstanding chess players owe their excellence more to their supe- rior template-based knowledge of chess than slow, strategy-based processes. This knowledge can be accessed rapidly and permits expert players to narrow down the possible moves they consider. (3) Expert chess players store away the precise board locations of pieces after studying a board position. Chess pieces close together are most likely to be found in the same template (Gobet & Simon, 2000). (4) Expert players have superior recall than non-experts of random chess positions. The reason is they are better at recognising small chunks occurring by chance even in random positions. However, the memory superiority of experts should be greater with structured positions because experts can use their greater template knowledge as well as their greater chunk knowledge. Findings Gobet and Clarkson (2004) reported support for the first prediction. Expert players recalled chessboard positions much better than novices. However, the number of templates (averaging out at about 2) did not vary as a func- tion of playing strength. The maximum template size was 13–15 for masters compared to only about 6 for novices. Evidence relating to the second prediction is less consistent. Charness et al. (2001) reported supportive evidence. Expert players were significantly more likely than intermediate players to fixate tactically relevant pieces very rapidly (within about 1 second). Sheridan and Reingold (2017a) pre- sented four chess positions at the same time and asked chess players to find the one allowing the knight to reach a target square in three moves. Expert players’ eye movements indicated they were much faster than novices to fixate the target board. Further support was reported by Burns (2004), who focused on blitz chess (the entire game must be completed in 5 minutes). He assumed performance in blitz chess must depend mainly on players’ template-based knowledge because there is insufficient time to engage in slow searching through possible moves. As predicted, performance in blitz chess correlated highly (+.78 to +.90) with performance in standard chess. Evidence less supportive of the second prediction was reported by van Harreveld et al. (2007) and Chang and Lane (2016). Skill differences between players were less predictive of game outcome as the time available decreased suggesting slow processes are more important for strong than weak players. Chang and Lane studied speed chess (longer than blitz chess but much shorter than standard chess). Players (especially stronger ones) often spent a con- siderable amount of time on a few moves indicating they were using strategy- based processes. Fernand Gobet. Courtesy Fernand Gobet.

(2012) asked experts and tou rnament players to think aloud while selecting the best possible moves with several problems. Their final move was generally much stronger than the first move consid- ered for both groups (see Figure 12.17). Thus, slow, strategy-based processes play a key role in chess. We turn now to the third prediction. Chess players typically recall the precise squares occupied by given pieces within a template when asked to memorise board posi- tions. However, actual chess playing focuses much more on evaluating board positions. McGregor and Howes (2002) asked expert players to evaluate various chess positions. These players subsequently had much better memory for attack/defence relations than precise board locations of the pieces. Linhares et al. (2012) found grandmasters outper- formed masters, more with respect to memory for abstract features (e.g., strategically signifi- cant attacks or defences) than superficial fea- tures (e.g., specific board positions). The fourth prediction is that expert players will have better recall than non- experts of random chess positions. Supporting evidence was reported by Sala and Gobet (2017) in a meta-analysis. As predicted, the beneficial effects of expertise on recall of random chess positions were smaller than those obtained previously in structured chess positions. Evaluation Template theory has several successes to its credit. First, much of the infor- mation experts store from board positions consists of a few large templates. Second, outstanding chess players possess much more knowledge about chess positions than experts, which gives them a substantial advantage when playing chess. Third, the tendency of experts to win at blitz chess is due mainly to their superior template-based knowledge (Burns, 2004). Fourth, experts have better recall of random board positions than non- experts (Sala & Gobet, 2017). What are the limitations of template theory? First, slow search pro- cesses are more important to expert players than assumed by the theory (Moxley et al., 2012; van Harreveld et al., 2007). This is even the case with speed chess (Chang & Lane, 2016). Second, the most expert players often use strategies allowing them to go beyond stored knowledge of chess positions. Bilalić et al.

International Masters were far more likely than Candidate Masters to find the shorter solution (50% vs 0%) because they were better at avoiding the familiar, template-based solution. Third, the precise nature of the information stored in long-term memory remains controversial. Template theory assumes the precise loca- tions of pieces are typically stored. However, it is likely attack/defence relations are more important (Linhares et al., 2012; McGregor & Howes, 2002). According to the theory, chess players have stored information in the form of chunks and templates. However, it is often hard to identify their respective roles. Fourth, template theory de-emphasises the importance of cognitive ability. Grabner et al. (2007) found all chess masters they studied had above-average intelligence. In addition, intelligence correlated significantly with the players’ rated skill level. Burgoyne et al. (2016) found in a meta- analytic review that chess skill correlated positively with several aspects of cognitive ability (e.g., processing speed; fluid reasoning, which involves understanding novel relationships). MEDICAL EXPERTISE The processes involved in chess-playing expertise may (or may not) resemble those involved in other forms of expertise. Accordingly we will now consider medical expertise, specifically the ability of medical experts to make rapid and accurate diagnoses. This ability can literally be a matter of life-or-death. We will focus mostly on the search for abnormalities in medical images (e.g., X-rays; brain scans). Various methods have been used including eye-tracking and the think-aloud technique (Gegenfurtner et al., 2017). Eye-tracking can provide useful information about visual attention and subconscious processes, and think-aloud data can shed light on individu- als’ eye fixations and decision-making. How do medical experts’ strategies differ from those of non-experts? One approach assumes there are three main reasons why abnormalities in medical images fail to be detected (see Figure 12.18): (1) There are detection errors when the crucial area within the image is not fixated. (2) There are recognition errors when the crucial area is fixated briefly but the doctor fails to appreciate its significance. (3) There are judgemental errors when the crucial area is fixated for some time (indicating it raised some concern) but its significance is not fully appreciated. The most obvious prediction is that experts will have fewer errors of all three types than non-experts. Figure 12.18 indicates three processes of relevance to the various error types. First, there is global or holistic perception of the image; if that is incomplete or ineffective, detection errors will occur. Second, there is focal or selective processing, involving deeper processing of only certain spe- cific visual elements; failure of such processing leads to recognition errors.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nProblem solving and expertise 605 Third, there is pattern matching, which involves finding a match between the visual medical image and patterns stored in long-term memory; failure of such processing leads to judgemental errors. There is an important distinction between explicit and implicit rea- soning (Engel, 2008). Explicit reasoning is slow, deliberate and is asso- ciated with conscious awareness. In contrast, implicit reasoning is fast, “automatic” and not associated with conscious awareness. It involves the global processing identified by Al-Moteri et al. (2017; see Figure 12.18). Dual-process theories of judgement (see Chapter 13) and reasoning (see Chapter 14) are based on a similar distinction. The crucial assumption is that medical experts engage mainly in implicit reasoning whereas novices rely mostly on explicit (analytic) rea- soning. This assumption makes sense given that experts have substantially more relevant visual and other knowledge stored in long-term memory. As a result, they can often rapidly engage in pattern matching (i.e., relating a given medical image to stored knowledge). We will consider evidence relevant to the above explicit–implicit distinc- tion with respect to visual specialities (e.g., pathology; radiology). Note that experts generally cross-check their diagnoses with slow, deliberate processes even if they start with fast, “automatic” ones (McLaughlin et al., 2008). Findings Sheridan and Reingold (2017b) reviewed research testing the hypothesis that experts engage in holistic or global processing.

Kundel and Nodine (1975) found expert radi- ologists detected abnormalities very rapidly. Chest radiographs were pre- sented for only 200 milliseconds but were correctly interpreted 70% of the time. Another prediction is that medical experts should be better able than non-experts to make use of information presented in peripheral vision. Several studies support this prediction. Krupinski et al. (2013) carried out a longitudinal study of pathologists viewing breast biopsies at the start of their first, second, third and fourth years of residency. Over time, there was a substantial reduction in fixations per slide and less examination of non-diagnostic regions (see Figure 12.19). Thus, training produced enhanced attentional focus. Kundel et al. (2007) showed doctors experienced in mammography dif- ficult mammograms showing or not showing cancer. The mean time taken by experts to fixate a cancer was typically under 1 second. Time of first fixation on the cancer correlated –0.9 with performance (i.e., accurately detected breast cancer). Thus, fast fixation was an excellent predictor of performance. The rapid detection of abnormalities by experts suggests they engage in pattern matching (matching medical images to images stored in long- term memory). Of relevance, Jaarsma et al. (2014) considered how experts and non-experts explained their diagnoses after viewing medical images.

Nodine and Mello-Thoms (2010) argued that experts use a detect-then- search process, starting with rapid detection of diagnostically relevant information followed by a brief search to check there is no other relevant information. In contrast, novices use a search-then-detect process, involving extensive visual search and including much irrelevant information, followed by eventual detection of diagnostically relevant information. Brunyé et al. (2014) found novices were more likely than experts to fixate salient visual areas (e.g., brightly coloured ones) lacking diagnostic relevance. According to the theoretical framework shown in Figure 12.18, many detection failures occur even though the crucial area is fixated. Manning et al. (2006) studied nodule detection in chest radiology. Correct nega- tive decisions (i.e., no nodule) were made faster than incorrect negative decisions. In the latter case, participants often fixated the nodule and were suspicious of it but failed to recognise it as a nodule. Rubin et al. (2015) studied the detection of very small lung nodules by experienced radiol- ogists. The best performer detected 82% of fixated nodules whereas the worst performer detected only 47%. According to Al-Moteri et al. (2017), failures to detect abnormalities in medical images can occur because of judgemental errors. They discussed several studies in which medical experts sometimes fixated an abnormality for more than 1 second but failed to report it. Such findings are suggestive of judgemental errors. Are the effects of expertise on eye movements similar across differ- ent domains or areas? Gegenfurtner et al. (2011) reported a meta-analytic review involving domains including medicine, sport and transportation. Several differences between experts and non-experts were common across domains: (1) shorter fixations; (2) faster first fixations on task-relevant infor- mation; (3) more fixations on task-relevant information; (4) fewer fixations on task-irrelevant areas; and (5) longer saccades (rapid eye movements). We turn now to the roles of implicit and explicit (analytic) reasoning. Melo et al. (2012) argued medical experts use similar implicit or relatively “automatic” processes to those we all use when perceiving visual scenes. They found comparably fast times to diagnose abnormalities in chest X-ray images and to name animals (1.33 vs 1.23 seconds, respectively). Of most importance, diagnosing abnormalities and naming animals involved activa- tion in very similar brain regions (see Figure 12.20). However, diagnosing abnormalities was associated with greater activation in the frontal sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex, suggesting diagnosis is more cognitively demand- ing than naming animals. Naming letters involved similar brain regions to diagnosing abnormalities and naming animals but with less activation. How can we explain the above findings? Melo et al. (2012) suggested medical experts engage in rapid pattern recognition: each slide is compared against stored patterns from the past. In other words, they use a predom- inantly visual strategy. Kulatunga-Moruzi et al. (2004) asked three groups varying in expertise to diagnose skin diseases from photographs. Some participants made their decisions from the photographs alone whereas others were also given a Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["times.","From Krupinski et al."]}

The least expert group performed best when given the verbal descriptions plus the pho- tographs. In contrast, the more expert groups performed better without the verbal descriptions. They used a rapid visual strategy and the verbal descriptions interfered with their ability to use that strategy effectively. In spite of the above evidence, experts typically make some use of slow, explicit or analytic processes. Mamede et al. (2010a) compared the perfor- mance of medical experts and non-experts providing diagnoses immediately or after some analytic thinking. Analytic thinking enhanced the diagnostic performance of experts with complex cases but not simple ones. In contrast, non-experts derived no benefit from engaging in analytic thinking. Evaluation The diagnostic strategies used by medical experts and non-experts often differ considerably. Experts use fast holistic processes more than non- experts. In addition, experts are more proficient than non-experts at using Figure 12.20 Brain activation while diagnosing lesions in X-rays, naming animals and naming letters.

More generally, incorrect diagnoses can result from detection, recognition or judgemental errors. What are the limitations of theory and research? First, there are very few longitudinal studies (apart from Krupinski et al., 2013). Such studies are essential to understand the learning processes involved in the develop- ment of expertise. Second, we need more research on the ways fast and analytic processes are combined. For example, Kulatunga-Moruzi et al. (2011) found non- experts benefited from this combination when fast processes preceded ana- lytic ones but not when analytic processes came first. Third, relatively little research has compared different training pro- grammes designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Such research could clarify the advantages and disadvantages of different diagnostic strategies. Chess expertise vs medical expertise Chess and medical expertise have several similarities. First, intensive train- ing is required to attain genuine expertise. Second, this training leads to the acquisition of huge amounts of relevant stored knowledge. Third, experts in both areas are superior to non-experts at using rapid (appar- ently “automatic”) processes. Fourth, experts in both areas use analytic or strategy-based processes effectively when necessary. What are the differences between chess and medical expertise? First, while much of the knowledge possessed by chess experts consists of fairly abstract templates, medical experts are more likely to possess knowledge that is less abstract and more visual. Second, chess experts must relate a current chess position to their stored knowledge and then consider their potential next move and that of their opponent. In contrast, medical experts focus more narrowly on relating information about a specific case to their stored knowledge. BRAIN PLASTICITY The development of expertise involves acquiring huge amounts of knowl- edge and specialised cognitive processes. Does the development of expertise also cause modifications within the brain? The key concept here is plasticity: “changes in structure and function of the brain that affect behaviour and are related to experience or training” (Herholz & Zatorre, 2012, p. 486). It is often assumed structural changes resulting from plasticity facilitate further learning and the development of expertise. Before discussing research on expertise, we will mention compelling evi- dence for plasticity in individuals becoming blind at an early age. They exhibit high levels of activity in occipital cortex (typically involved in visual pro- cessing) when performing many non-visual tasks (e.g., reading Braille; local- ising sound) (Heimler et al., 2014). This is known as cross-modal plasticity. Taxi drivers Important research was carried out on London taxi or cab drivers, who have to acquire “The Knowledge”. This consists of detailed knowledge KEY TERM Plasticity Changes within the brain occurring as a result of brain damage or experience.

Unsurprisingly, it takes three years to acquire all this information. How do cab drivers develop this extraordinary knowledge and exper- tise? The hippocampus (an area within the medial temporal lobes) is of major importance, as might be expected given its central role in long-term memory (see Chapter 6). Hippocampal damage is also associated with impaired spatial navigation skills (McCormick et al., 2018). Unsurprisingly, a taxi driver who had recently suffered extensive hippocampal damage had severely impaired navigation skills (Maguire et al., 2006). Acquisition of “The Knowledge” probably has a direct effect on the hippocampus. Experienced London cab drivers have a greater volume of grey matter in the posterior hippocampus than novice drivers (Woollett et al., 2009). However, cab drivers have a smaller volume of grey matter than other people in the anterior hippocampus. This is an area used in processing novel stimuli, imagining events and recalling events (Zeidman & Maguire, 2016). The finding that cab drivers perform poorly on tasks requiring them to learn and remember new object-place associations may reflect their reduced grey matter in the anterior hippocampus (Woollett & Maguire, 2009). Causality The findings discussed so far are correlational and so cannot show acquir- ing “The Knowledge” causes hippocampal changes. Somewhat more direct evidence was reported by Woollett and Maguire (2011). Among adults who had spent several years acquiring “The Knowledge”, only those who suc- ceeded in becoming London taxi drivers had a selective increase in grey matter in their posterior hippocampus. Hyde et al. (2009) studied 6-year-old children who received 15 months of instrumental musical training. They showed significant changes in voxel size (a voxel is a small cube of brain tissue) in the primary motor area (see Figure 12.21) and the primary auditory area (see Figure 12.22). In addition, children having the greatest brain changes showed the greatest improvement in musical skills. More evidence that training can alter brain structure was reported by de Manzano and Ullén (2018). They studied monozygotic (identical) twins where one twin had received at least 1,000 hours of piano practice more than the other, thus controlling for genetic factors. The brains of the more musically trained twins differed in various ways from the less trained ones (e.g., they had greater cortical thickness within the auditory-motor network). Herholz et al. (2016) carried out a longitudinal study in which adults received six weeks of training in playing the piano. There was evidence for plasticity: training enhanced activity in brain areas (e.g., premotor and posterior parietal regions) involved in motor preparation and sensori- motor integration. Other brain areas (e.g., parts of the primary auditory cortex; premotor cortex) predicted individuals’ learning rates during piano training. These brain areas reflected individual differences in predisposi- tion (potential for learning musical skills). In sum, these findings emphasise the value of considering individual differences in pre-training brain activity (predisposition).

Center, Inc. Evaluation Numerous studies have shown predictable differences in brain structure and function between individuals with varying amounts of training in a given domain (Zatorre, 2013). Support for the hypothesis that developing exper- tise can cause changes in brain structure has come from longitudinal studies where brain structure was assessed before, during and after training and from de Manzano and Ullén’s (2018) study on monozygotic twins. Progress has been made in identifying brain areas associated with predisposition (potential for learning) and training-related plasticity during learning (e.g., Herholz et al., 2016). What are the limitations of research on plasticity and expertise? First, it is hard to show definitively that practice has caused changes in brain structure of relevance to performance improvement. Second, most research has focused on musical training. This is reasonable given that musical training influences auditory perception and several aspects of higher-level cognition. However, it means the relevant database is relatively narrow.

(2016) found expert pianists had greater grey matter volume than controls in the putamen (involved in motor control and reinforcement learning). However, these experts had smaller grey matter volume than controls in other brain areas (e.g., superior temporal gyrus) involved in auditory processing and sen- sorimotor control. We lack a coherent theoretical understanding of such complexities. DELIBERATE PRACTICE AND BEYOND We have seen deliberate practice over a period of many years is essential to become an expert in a given domain. That is obvious. Less obvious are the answers to two related issues. First, what determines the effectiveness of prolonged practice? Second, what factors other than prolonged practice are required to become an expert?

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nProblem solving and expertise 613 Ericsson (e.g., 2017) argued that the answer to the first ques- tion is deliberate practice. More specifically, he claimed that ten years (10,000 hours) of deliberate practice is required to achieve expertise. Controversially, he claimed such practice is the most important factor required to develop expertise and that innate talent or ability is of little or no relevance. Deliberate practice has four aspects: (1) The task is at an appropriate level of difficulty (not too easy or hard). (2) The learner is given informative feedback about their performance. (3) The learner has adequate chances to repeat the task. (4) The learner has the opportunity to correct their errors. What happens as a result of prolonged deliberate practice? According to Ericsson and Kintsch (1995), experts can reduce the negative effects of having limited working memory capacity. They put forward the notion of long-term working memory. The crucial notion is that “fast . . . transfer to LTM [long-term memory] becomes possible with expertise via knowledge structures, which enables LTM [long-term memory] to be used during WM [working memory] tasks, thus giving the appearance of expanding individu- als’ WM capacity” (Guida et al., 2013, p. 1). Suppose expert and novice chess players learn the positions of chess pieces on a board. Novices rely largely on working memory (a limited- capacity system that processes and stores information briefly; see Chapter 6). In contrast, experts use their huge relevant knowledge to store much of the information directly in long-term memory and thus enhance their recall of the board position. In other words, experts use long-term working memory, but novices do not. IN REAL LIFE: MAGNUS CARLSEN, WORLD CHESS CHAMPION The Norwegian Magnus Carlsen was born on 30 November 1990. He became a chess grand- master at the amazingly young age of 13 and the world chess champion in November 2013 (aged 22). In 2014, he was rated the strongest player in chess history. The difference between him and the second-best player (Levon Aronian) was almost as great as that between the 2nd and 14th best players. One of his greatest strengths is his “nettlesomeness” – meaning he is a vexatious individual who is superb at making moves that pressurise opponents into making mistakes. Magnus Carlsen disproves the main assump- tions of Ericsson’s deliberate practice theory. First, he became a grandmaster after only five years of deliberate practice although Ericsson claimed ten years of deliberate practice are required to achieve outstanding levels of performance.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n614 Thinking and reasoning Second, according to Ericsson’s theory, we would expect Magnus Carlsen to have accumulated more years of deliberate practice than other top chess players. However, when he became world champion, he had devoted 6½ years fewer to deliberate practice than the average of the next 10 best players in the world (Gobet & Ereku, 2014). Across the top 11 players in the world, the association between rating and number of years of practice was modestly negative. According to Ericsson’s theory, it should have been strongly positive. In sum, Magnus Carlsen’s career shows that talent and deliberate practice are both essential for the development of outstanding expertise. Indeed, Carlsen’s extraordinary talent has led to him being called “the Mozart of chess”. Findings: positive Ericsson and Chase (1982) demonstrated the powerful effects of deliberate practice. A student, SF, received extensive practice (one hour a day for two years) on the digit-span task (random digits are recalled immediately in the correct order). He increased his digit span from 7 digits to 80 (10 times the average performance level). SF made use of his great knowledge of running times (e.g., “3594” was Bannister’s world-record time for the mile and so he stored these digits as a single unit or chunk). After that, he organised chunks into a hierarchical retrieval structure. Thus, SF made very effect- ive use of long-term working memory. Another student (Dario Donatelli) increased his digit span from 8 to 104 digits following 800 hours of practice (Yoon et al., 2018). Guida et al. (2012) reviewed neuroimaging studies comparing novices and experts performing working memory tasks. There were two main findings. First, experts and novices both showed activation in pre- frontal and parietal areas associated with working memory processes. Second, only experts showed activation in medial temporal regions strongly associated with long-term memory. This finding suggests experts make more use than novices of long-term memory processes during task performance. To what extent can individuals’ level of expertise be accounted for by individual differences in deliberate practice? Campitelli and Gobet (2011) found across many studies on chess-playing expertise that the correlation between total practice hours and chess skill exceeded +.50. However, such correlational evidence cannot prove that the former directly caused the latter. Findings: negative We turn now to findings indicating that expertise does not depend mainly on deliberate practice. Macnamara et al. (2014) found in a meta-analytic review that the average correlation between deliberate practice and per- formance was +.35, which suggests deliberate practice explains 12% of the variance in performance. However, the percentage of the variance explained differed considerably across domains: it was 26% for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, but only 4% for education and <1% for the professions.

(2016b) confirmed in a further meta-analytic review that deliberate practice accounted for 18% of the variance in sports per- formance. However, when they focused on elite samples, deliberate prac- tice explained only 1% of the variance in sports performance. How can we explain this last finding? Nearly all elite individuals have benefited from excellent environmental conditions (e.g., prolonged deliberate prac- tice; top-class coaching) and so individual differences in expertise probably reflect genetic rather than environmental factors. More direct evidence was reported by Güllich (2017). Those sports people who had won medals at Olympic and/or world championships accumulated fewer hours of deliberate practice across their careers than non-medallists. Campitelli and Gobet (2011) identified three predictions from deliber- ate practice theory: (1) All individuals engaging in massive distributed practice should achieve very high skill levels. (2) The variability across individuals in the number of hours required to achieve high expertise should be small. (3) Everyone’s skill level should benefit comparably from any given amount of distributed practice. Campitelli and Gobet (2011) considered the above three predictions with reference to chess. None was supported. So far as the first prediction is con- cerned, there are several chess players who have devoted over 20,000 hours to practice without becoming masters. With respect to the second prediction, the practice hours required to achieve master level varied between 3,000 and 23,600 hours. Evidence against the third prediction was reported by Howard (2009). He studied candidates (elite players who have competed for the right to challenge the world champion); non-candidate grandmasters (elite players but less expert than candidates); and non-grandmasters. Their skill ratings as a function of games played are shown in Figure 12.23. There are two points of interest. First, these three groups showed clear performance dif- ferences early on which increased over games. Second, players in all groups showed no improvement after playing about 750 games. Howard (2009) found additional evidence of a performance ceiling among five players who had played over 2,300 games (representing more than 8,000 hours’ playing time!). These players showed no improvement over the last 1,000(+) games they played. Thus, the beneficial effects of deliberate practice are limited. The above findings suggest it is possible early in their careers to iden- tify those who will eventually become outstanding chess players, suggesting they have very high natural talent. The same is true in sports such as tennis and golf (think of Federer, the Williams sisters and Woods). The findings also suggest there is a ceiling on the performance level any individual can attain based on their natural talent. The finding that deliberate practice typically correlates positively with expert performance does not necessarily mean the former causes the latter. For example, individuals with much innate talent are likely to enjoy early Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["al cues in working memory (see Glossary).","Research activity: Skill acquisition Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

Thus, performance level can influence the amount of practice. Dramatic evidence supporting the above point of view was reported by Mosing et al. (2014) in a twin study on music practice and music ability. Genetic factors accounted for 40%–70% of individual differences in hours of music practice – this probably occurred because individuals with more innate talent practised more. Of importance, there was no difference in music ability between monozygotic (identical) twins even when they dif- fered in the amount of music practice. Thus, the relationship between music practice and music ability depended mostly on genetic factors. Evaluation Memory in a domain of expertise can be developed via the use of long-term working memory and this can reduce limitations on processing capacity. However, enhanced storage of domain-relevant information forms only part of what is required to develop expertise. Unsurprisingly, nearly all the evidence supports the contention that prolonged deliberate practice is nec- essary to achieve outstanding levels of expertise. What are the theory’s limitations? First, it is hard to test because of vague definitions. For example, “deliberate practice” sometimes refers to teacher- or coach-designed activities and sometimes to solitary practice (Hambrick et al., 2018), and several definitions of “expert” have been used (Macnamara et al., 2016a). Second, Ericsson’s research is narrow in scope. Most factors influenc- ing expertise could not be identified because of their focus on deliberate practice (see below, pp. 617–619). Even with such narrow research, individ- ual differences in deliberate practice are only moderately related to perfor- mance (e.g., Macnamara et al., 2014, 2016b). Third, Ericsson emphasised the role of long-term working memory (see Glossary) in expertise. Experts use stored structures in long-term memory Figure 12.23 Mean chess ratings of candidates, non-candidate grandmasters (GMs) and all non-grandmasters as a function of number of games played.

However, it is not necessary to hypothesise the existence of a brand new form of working memory (Baddeley, 2012). Fourth, it is assumed deliberate practice causes expertise. This begs the question of why individual differences in distributed practice exist. The evi- dence suggests naturally talented individuals are more motivated to devote substantial time to deliberate practice than less talented individuals. Fifth, deliberate practice theory provides an extreme environmen- talist approach to understanding the development of expertise. As such, it ignores several factors (e.g., intelligence; gene-environment interactions) of demonstrable importance to expertise (Ullén et al., 2016; see below). Sixth, the importance of deliberate practice depends on the domain (or area) of expertise (Macnamara et al., 2014). Deliberate prac- tice influences the development of expertise more in relatively specific domains (e.g., increasing digit span) than in much broader and more complex ones (e.g., succeeding in the professions) (Gottfredson, 1997; discussed below). Seventh, the theory is very oversimplified. Its assumption that delib- erate practice is sufficient (as well as necessary) for the development of expertise is wrong. Beyond deliberate practice: multifactorial gene- environment interaction model As we have seen, deliberate practice is not the only important factor deter- mining the development of expertise. Ullén et al. (2016) used findings such as those discussed above to develop their impressive-sounding multi- factorial gene-environment interaction model (see Figure 12.24).

(1) Hambrick et al. (2018, p. 291) pointed out, “At the core of MGIM [multifactorial gene-environment interaction model] is the assumption that expertise is multiply determined.” (2) The development of expertise depends on both domain-specific know- ledge and skills (fostered by deliberate practice) and domain-general abilities (e.g., intelligence; personality). (3) There is gene-environment interaction (the magnitude of genetic influences on performance varies as a function of the nature of envi- ronmental experiences). (4) There is gene-environment correlation (individuals experience differ- ent environments as a function of their genetic make-up). (5) Deliberate practice increases expertise in part by modifying neural mechanisms (e.g., brain plasticity). (6) Individual differences in deliberate practice are determined in part by genetic factors relating to personality, abilities and motivation. Findings There is considerable evidence supporting the second assumption above. Hambrick et al. (2019) reviewed research indicating that expertise in many areas depends on the domain-general ability of intelligence or cognitive ability. As we saw earlier, intelligence is positively correlated with chess expertise (Burgoyne et al., 2016). Evidence indicating that intelligence or IQ influences the development of expertise was reviewed by Gottfredson (1997). The correlation between IQ and work performance was +.58 for high-complexity jobs (e.g., biolo- gist; city circulation manager). In addition, the mean IQ of those in very complex jobs (e.g., accountants; lawyers; doctors) was about 120–130 (much higher than the population mean of 100). However, intelligence is much less relevant for relatively specific skills. For example, Ceci and Liker (1986) found experts at calculating the odds in harness racing had IQs ranged from 81 to 128 and there was no relationship between performance and IQ. Hambrick and Tucker-Drob (2015) reported findings supporting the model’s third and fourth assumptions in a study on music practice and accomplishment in twins. There was evidence for gene-environment inter- action: genetic influences on music accomplishment were greater among participants who engaged in music practice. There was also evidence for gene-environment correlation: there were genetic effects on the amount of music practice. Indeed, these effects were greater than genetic effects on music accomplishment. Research relevant to the fifth assumption was discussed earlier. In spite of problems with establishing that deliberate practice has causal influences on neural mechanisms, the evidence overall supports this assumption (e.g., de Manzano & Ullén, 2018). Evidence that personality plays a role in determining individual differ- ences in deliberate practice was discussed by Ullén et al. (2016). High levels of grit or conscientiousness are associated with high levels of deliberate practice whereas high impulsivity is associated with low levels of practice.

For example, individuals’ vocational interests influence what they choose to focus on and how much time and effort they expend pursuing those interests (Ackerman, 2014). Evaluation The multifactorial gene-environment interaction model is considerably more ambitious in scope than Ericsson’s approach based on deliberate practice. There is compelling evidence that all the factors identified by the model influence the development of expertise. There is also evidence that these factors interact in complex ways largely consistent with the predic- tions of the model. In sum, this model is currently the most comprehensive model we have of the development of expertise. What are the model’s limitations? First, much more research is required to test some of the complex predictions made by the model. Second, we need to move beyond predicting gene-environment interactions and corre- lations to identify the specific genes responsible for these effects. Third, the model predicts that interactions among the factors influencing the devel- opment of expertise will vary over time. As yet, there has been a dearth of longitudinal studies testing such predictions. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. This chapter is devoted to problem solving, analogical problem solving and reasoning, and expertise. Most research on problem solving focuses on problems requiring no special knowledge. In contrast, research on expertise typically involves problems requiring considerable background knowledge. Analogical problem solving focuses on the use of previous knowledge and experience on a current problem, whereas expertise research is concerned with what differentiates experts from novices in a given area. • Gestalt approach and beyond: insight and role of experience. Much research supports the notion of insight. However, insight is hard to measure, and “insight” problems are often solved with no evidence of insight. Incubation often benefits problem solving because misleading information or ineffective strategies are forgotten. Representational change theory claims correctly that solving insight problems often requires constraint relaxation and/or re-encoding of the problem representation. However, it underestimates the range of strategies used on insight problems. The phenomena of functional fixedness and mental set show past experience can impair problem solving. High cognitive control sometimes impairs performance on tasks involving insight, functional fixedness or mental set.

Problem solvers use heuristics (e.g., hill climbing; means–ends analysis). They also use meta- cognitive processes to determine their problem-solving strategies. Much problem solving involves successive stages of problem representation, planning and plan execution. The prefrontal cortex is heavily involved in planning and problem solving generally. There is more planning when it is costly to access task-relevant information. Cognitive misers fail to solve some problems because of a reluctance to engage in effortful processing. • Analogical problem solving and reasoning. Analogical problem solving depends on three kinds of similarity: superficial, structural and procedural. Failures to use analogies often occur through failures to retrieve relevant information from memory. Such failures can be reduced if problem solvers identify the underlying structure of the current problem. Four-term analogy problems involve four component processes: encoding, inferring, mapping and applying, of which inference and mapping are typically the hardest. Individuals high in fluid intelligence have excellent analogical reasoning due to their superior top-down executive attention, ability to disengage (e.g., inhibit irrelevant information) and think flexibly. The left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex is the brain area of greatest relevance to analogical reasoning (especially mapping). • Chess-playing expertise. Expertise is typically assessed by using knowledge-rich problems. Expert chess players differ from non- expert ones in having greater cognitive ability and possessing far more template-based and chunk-based knowledge. This knowledge permits expert players to identify good moves rapidly. However, the precise information contained in templates remains unclear. The template approach de-emphasises experts’ use of slow search processes and complex strategies. • Medical expertise. Medical experts (e.g., radiologists) often rely more than non-experts on fast, automatic processes in diagnosis: they rapidly fixate relevant information and ignore task-irrelevant information. Slow, analytic processes enhance diagnostic performance (especially for experts). Diagnostic errors can be due to failures in detection, recognition or judgement. Medical expertise involves more visual and less abstract knowledge than chess expertise. It is also more narrowly focused. • Brain plasticity. There are differences in brain structure between experts and non-experts (e.g., taxi drivers). Training studies (especially in music) have shown that these changes in brain structure are often caused by experience and reflect brain plasticity. The structural changes associated with brain plasticity probably provide experts with an additional benefit compared to non-experts.

According to Ericsson, the development of expertise depends only on deliberate practice (involving informative feedback and the opportunity to correct errors). In fact, deliberate practice is necessary (but not sufficient) for developing expertise. The importance of innate talent is suggested by the variability in the amount of practice required to achieve high expertise and individual differences in the benefits of a given amount of practice. As predicted by the multifactorial gene-environment interaction model, innate ability is especially important in broad domains (e.g., career success). The model also accurately predicts that genetic factors strongly influence the amount of deliberate practice. More generally, individual differences in expertise depend heavily on gene-environment interactions and gene-environment correlations.

Judgement involves deciding on the likelihood of various events using incomplete information. For example, you might use informa- tion about your previous examination performance to judge the probability you will succeed in your next examination. What matters in judgement is accuracy. Decision-making involves selecting one option from several possi- bilities. For example, you may have had to decide which college or uni- versity to attend, which courses to study and so on. The factors involved in decision-making depend on the importance of the decision – the pro- cesses involved in deciding on a career path are much more complex and time-consuming than deciding whether to drink a Coke or a Pepsi! Problem solving (discussed in Chapter 12) differs from decision-making in that individuals must generate their own solutions rather than choosing from presented options. We typically assess decision quality in terms of consequences – are we happy with our choice of university or course? This can be unfair. There is the story of a surgeon saying “The operation was a success. Unfortunately, the patient died”. This sounds like a sick joke in every sense. In fact, however, a decision can be good given the information available at the time even if its consequences are poor. Judgement typically forms an important initial part of the decision- making process. For example, someone deciding which car to buy might make judgements about how much various cars would cost to run, how reliable they would be and how much he/she would enjoy owing one. What does research on judgement and decision-making tell us about human rationality? That issue is part of a broader one concern- ing human rationality and logicality in general. That issue (including con- sideration of research on judgement and decision-making) is discussed in Chapter 14.

Suppose you are 90% sure someone has lied to you. However, their version of events is later confirmed by someone else, leading you to believe there is only a 60% chance you have been lied to. In everyday life, new information often increases or decreases the strength of our beliefs. The Rev. Thomas Bayes provided a precise way of thinking about such cases (unsurprisingly, his approach is known as Bayesian inference). He focused on situations where there are two possible subjective beliefs or hypotheses (e.g., X is lying vs X is not lying) and showed how new data or information changes the subjective probabilities of each hypothesis being correct. According to Bayes’ theorem, we need to evaluate beliefs concerning the relative probabilities of the two hypotheses before the data are obtained (prior odds or beliefs). We also need to calculate the relative probabilities of obtaining the observed data under each hypothesis (likelihood ratio). Bayesian methods evaluate the probability of observing the data, D, if hypothesis A is correct, written p(D/HA), and if hypothesis B is correct, written p(D/HB). Bayes’ theorem is expressed as an odds ratio: p(HA/D) p(HA) p(D/HA) –––––––– = –––––– × –––––––– p(HB/D) p(HB) p(D/HB) The above formula may look intimidating, but it is not really (honestly!). On the left side of the equation are the relative probabilities of hypotheses A and B in the light of the new data. These are the probabilities we want to work out. On the right side of the equation, we have the prior odds of each hypothesis being correct before the data were collected mul- tiplied by the likelihood ratio based on the probability of the data given each hypothesis. We can apply Bayes’ theorem to Kahneman and Tversky’s (1972) taxi- cab problem. A cab was involved in an accident one night. Of the city’s cabs, 85% belonged to the Green company and 15% to the Blue company. An eyewitness identified the cab as a Blue cab. However, when her ability to identify cabs under similar visibility conditions was tested, she was wrong 20% of the time. What is the probability the cab was Blue? The hypothesis the cab was Blue is HA and the hypothesis it was Green is HB. The prior probability for HA is .15 and for HB it is .85 because 15% of the cabs are blue and 85% are green. The probability of the eyewitness identifying the cab as Blue when it was Blue, p(D/HA) is .80. Finally, the probability the eyewitness identifies the cab as Blue when it was Green, p(D/HB) is .20. According to the formula: 0.15 0.80 0.12 –––– × –––– = –––– 0.85 0.20 0.17 Thus, the odds ratio is 12:17 and there is a 41% (12/29) the taxi cab was Blue. Alas, this is not the most popular answer.

Interactive exercise: Taxi-cab problem Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n624 Thinking and reasoning Neglecting base rates According to Bayes’ theorem, individuals making judgements should take account of the base-rate information (the relative frequency of an event within a given population). However, such information is often ignored or de-emphasised. With the taxi-cab problem, most people ignore the base- rate information about the relative numbers of Green and Blue cabs. They consider only the evidence of the witness and so conclude wrongly there is an 80% probability the taxi was Blue rather than Green. Kahneman and Tversky (1973) provided another example of people ignoring base-rate information. Participants were given the lawyer-engineer problem: Jack is a 45-year-old man. He is married and has four children. He is generally conservative, careful and ambitious. He shows no interest in political and social issues and spends most of his free time on his many hobbies which include home carpentry, sailing and numerical puzzles. The participants were told the description had been selected at random from 100 descriptions. Half were told 70 descriptions were of engineers and 30 of lawyers, whereas the others were told 70 were of lawyers and 30 of engineers. On average, the participants decided there was a .90 probability Jack was an engineer regardless of whether most of the 100 descriptions were of lawyers or engineers. Thus, participants ignored the base-rate information (i.e., the 70:30 split in the 100 descriptions). Heuristics Tversky and Kahneman (e.g., 1974) argued most people given judgement tasks use rules of thumb or heuristics. Heuristics are “strategies that ignore part of the information, with the goal of making decisions more quickly, frugally and/or accurately than more complex methods” (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 454). Heuristics often greatly reduce the effort associ- ated with cognitive tasks. Representativeness heuristic Our use of heuristics can lead us to ignore base-rate information. More spe- cifically, we use the representativeness heuristic, which involves deciding an object or person belongs to a given category because it appears typical or representative of that category. For example, Jack’s description (see above) seems that of a typical engineer. Tversky and Kahneman (1983) studied the conjunction fallacy, the mis- taken belief that the conjunction or combination of two events (A and B) is more likely than one event (A or B) on its own. Consider the following description: Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. KEY TERMS Base-rate information The relative frequency of an event within a given population. Heuristics: representa- tiveness heuristic The assumption that an object or individual belongs to a specified category because it is representative (typical) of that category. Conjunction fallacy The mistaken assumption that the probability of a conjunction of two events is greater than the probability of one of them.

Supporting evidence was dis- cussed by Groopman (2007). Evan McKinley (a pseu- donym) was a forest ranger in his early forties. He was slim and very fit. While hiking, he experienced severe discomfort in his chest so that it hurt every time he took a breath. Accordingly, he went to see a doctor (Pat Croskerry). Croskerry ascertained McKinley had never smoked, was not under stress, his blood pres- sure was normal, and no problems were revealed by electrocardiogram and chest X-ray. Dr Croskerry concluded, “I’m not at all worried about your chest pain. You probably overexerted yourself in the field and strained a muscle. My sus- picion that this is coming from your heart is about zero.” Shortly afterwards, McKinley had a heart attack. This led Croskerry to admit, “I missed it because my thinking was overly influenced by how Is it more likely Linda is a bank teller or a bank teller active in the feminist movement? Most people (including you?) argue it is more likely she is a feminist bank teller. They seem to rely on the representativeness heuristic – the description sounds more like that of a feminist bank teller than of a bank teller. This is the conjunction fallacy: all feminist bank tellers belong to the larger category of bank tellers! Many people misinterpret the statement “Linda is a bank teller”, as implying she is not active in the feminist movement. However, the conjunc- tion fallacy is still found when almost everything is done to ensure people interpret the problem correctly (Sides et al., 2002). Standard explanations of the conjunction fallacy (including those based on the representativeness heuristic) assume it occurs because of the high perceived probability of the additional information (i.e., Linda is a feminist activist) given the description. Tentori et al. (2013) argued for a subtly different explanation: the hypothesis that Linda is a feminist activist is strongly supported by her description. Tentori et al. (2013) contrasted these explanations by considering a further additional scenario: “Linda is a bank teller and owns a pair of black shoes.” It is more probable Linda owns a pair of black shoes than that she is an activist feminist. However, the information she owns a pair of black shoes is hardly supported by her description. Thus, standard explanations would predict Linda owning a pair of black shoes would be rated as likelier than her being a feminist activist whereas the hypothesis explanation predicts the opposite. Tentori et al.’s findings supported the hypothesis explanation. Dr Pat Croskerry. Courtesy Pat Croskerry.

Bialek (2017) used the engineer-lawyer problem dis- cussed earlier (p. 624). The mean estimated probability that a description drawn randomly from a sample of 1,000 was an engineer was .84 when 997 of the sample were engineers compared to .53 when only 3 were engineers. More strikingly, Bialek found with similar problems that many participants made use of base-rate information irrelevant to the judgement task. Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) argued that we possess valuable causal knowledge allowing us to make accurate judgements using base-rate infor- mation in our everyday lives. However, laboratory judgement problems generally fail to provide such knowledge. Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) gave some participants the following judgement task (the false positive scenario): The following statistics are known about women at age 60 who partic- ipate in a routine mammogram screening, an X-ray of the breast tissue that detects tumours: ● 2% of women have breast cancer at the time of screening. Most of them will receive a positive result on the mammogram. ● There is a 6% chance that a woman without breast cancer will receive a positive result on the mammogram. Suppose a woman at age 60 gets a positive result during a routine mammogram screening. Without knowing any other symptoms, what are the chances she has breast cancer? The base rate of cancer in the population was often neglected by partic- ipants given this task. This may have happened because breast cancer is the only cause of positive mammograms explicitly mentioned. Suppose the healthy this man looked, and the absence of risk factors.” In other words, McKinley seemed very representative of healthy people with an extremely low risk of having a heart attack. Crupi et al. (2018) investigated the double conjunction fallacy: a conjunction of two statements (A + B) is judged to be more probable than statement (A) and then statement (B) when considered on their own. Medical experts were provided with a scenario in which a man has chronic anaemia. Crupi et al. found 49% of the medical experts committed the double conjunction fallacy – they judged it more likely that the man suffered from alcoholism and thalassemia trait (a blood disorder) than that he suffered from alcoholism or from thalassemia trait. However, this cannot be the case. Why did almost half of the medical experts exhibit this bias? Some of the clinical evidence pre- sented in the scenario was very consistent with the hypothesis that the man had both alcoholism and thalassemia. Thus, the findings are consistent with Tentori et al.’s (2013) hypothesis explanation. Saposnik et al. (2016) and Croskerry (2018) reviewed studies on cognitive biases associated with medical decisions. Common cognitive biases were anchoring (relying excessively on the first symptom identified), omission bias (preferring inaction over action) and overconfidence (excessive confidence in the correctness of one’s judgement). The reviewed evidence suggested cognitive biases were associated with diagnostic inaccuracies in between 36% and 77% of cases. However, the prevalence of cognitive biases in actual medical practice is currently unknown.

Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) did this by changing the wording of the third paragraph: ● There is a 6% chance that a woman without breast cancer will have a dense but harmless cyst that looks like a cancerous tumour and causes a positive result on the mammogram. Participants given the benign cyst scenario were far more likely to take full account of the base-rate information than those given the standard false pos- itive scenario (see Figure 13.1). Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) argued the reasonably full causal knowledge available to participants with the benign cyst scenario allowed them to solve the problem. It also corresponds to real life. In Kahneman and Tversky’s (1972) taxi-cab problem (discussed earlier, pp. 623–624), most participants ignored the base-rate information about the numbers of Green and Blue cabs. Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) argued that this happened because it was hard for participants to see the causal structure. Accordingly, they devised a version providing a reason why the witness might have made a mistake. Here is the crucial addition to the problem: When testing a sample of cabs, only 80% of the Blue Co. cabs appeared blue in colour, and only 80% of the Green Co. cabs appeared green in colour. Due to faded paint, 20% of Blue Co. cabs appeared green in colour, and 20% of Green Co. cabs appeared blue in colour. Only 8% of participants showed base-rate neglect with the faded paint version compared to 43% with the standard version. Correct answers increased from 8% with the standard version to 46% with the faded paint version. Thus, many people use base-rate information when they under- stand the underlying causal factors. People also use base-rate information when strongly motivated to do so. Suppose you were asked to put some saliva on a strip of paper. If it turned blue, that would mean you had an enzyme deficiency indicating a health problem. However, there is a 1/10 probability the test was mislead- ing. Unfortunately, the paper turned blue.

Most used the base-rate information (i.e., 1/10 probability of a misleading result) to argue the test was inaccurate. In contrast, participants who were told the paper turning blue meant they did not have a health problem perceived the test as accurate – they were not motivated to take account of the base-rate infor- mation. Motivation also distorts informal reasoning (see Chapter 14). For example, there is much evidence for myside bias (the tendency to favour information consistent with one’s prior beliefs over information inconsist- ent with those beliefs). Availability heuristic We turn now to the availability heuristic – the frequencies of events can be estimated by how easy or hard it is subjectively to retrieve them from long- term memory. Lichtenstein et al. (1978) asked people to judge the relative likelihood of different causes of death. Those attracting much publicity (e.g., murder) were judged more likely than those that do not (e.g., suicide) even when the opposite was the case. Pachur et al. (2012a) argued that we can explain people’s judged fre- quencies of various causes of death in three ways. First, they may use an availability heuristic based on their own direct experience. Second, they may use an availability heuristic based on media coverage of causes of death plus their own experience (availability by total experience). Third, they may use the affect heuristic: “Gauge your feeling of dread that Risk A and Risk B, respectively, evoke and infer that risk to be more prevalent in the popu- lation for which the dread is higher” (Pachur et al., 2012a, p. 316). What did Pachur et al. (2012a) find? Availability based on recall of direct experiences was the best predictor of the judged frequencies of dif- ferent causes of death (see Figure 13.2). Judged risks were also predicted by the affect heuristic. Availability based on media coverage was the least successful predictor. It should be emphasised that affect influences numerous kinds of judgements and that the term “affect heuristic” is used in various ways Figure 13.2 Percentage of correct predictions of the judged frequencies of different causes of death based on the affect heuristic (overall dread score), affect heuristic (single dread item), availability-by-recall (direct experience) and availability- by-total-experience (TEX: direct experience + media).

(2018) asked par- ticipants to judge the benefits of medical tests (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging scan for migraine headaches). Those receiving information indi- cating that a given test might cause harm experienced more negative affect and judged the benefits of the test as less than those put into a negative mood. Fazio et al. (2015) found truth ratings for false statements (e.g., “A date is a dried plum”) were greater for participants who had previously encountered them. Surprisingly, this was so even for participants who knew the correct answer. Thus, individuals often rely on readily availa- ble information even when they possess knowledge indicating they should not. Oppenheimer (2004) found the availability heuristic is sometimes overridden. Participants were presented with pairs of names (one famous, one non-famous) and asked to indicate which was more common. They would have chosen the famous names if using the availability heuristic, but mostly selected the non-famous ones. What happened was that the participants used deliberate thought to override the availability heuristic. When the task was performed under cognitive load to reduce deliberate thought, participants mistakenly chose the famous name 80% of the time (Oppenheimer & Monin, 2009). IN THE REAL WORLD: AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS Groopman (2007) discussed an example of poor medical decision-making triggered by the avail- ability heuristic. When Dr Harrison Alter was working at a hospital in Arizona, he saw dozens of patients suffering from viral pneumonia in a three-week period. One day, Blanche Begaye, a Navajo woman, arrived complaining of having trouble breathing. She said she had taken a few aspirin and was breathing at almost twice the normal rate. Dr Alter diagnosed viral pneumonia even though she lacked the white streaks in her lungs as well as lacking rhonchi (harsh sounds in the lungs characteristic of that disease). However, her blood had become slightly acidic, which can occur when someone has a major infection. A few minutes later, an internist argued correctly Blanche Begaye had aspirin toxicity, which occurs when patients overdose on that drug. Dr Alter used the availability heuristic because he was overly influenced by the numerous recent cases of viral pneumonia making that disease spring to mind. Mamede et al. (2010b) confirmed the problems potentially associated with the availability heu- ristic. Doctors faced with a case resembling ones recently encountered tended mistakenly to make the diagnosis appropriate only to the earlier cases. How can we reduce cognitive biases (e.g., those based on the availability and representativeness heuristics?). Lambe et al. (2016) reviewed studies using cognitive interventions to enhance diagnos- tic accuracy. The most effective intervention was guided reflection, which involved use of guided, structured, reflective processes. Another effective intervention involved considering possible alternative diagnoses. Of relevance, Dr Alter learned from his misdiagnosis to “make sure even when I think I have the answer to gen- erate a short list of alternatives”. A heuristic that has proved useful is to focus on ruling out the worst-case scenario (ROWS; Croskerry, 2018).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n630 Thinking and reasoning Overall evaluation Kahneman and Tversky identified numerous general heuristics or rules of thumb underlying judgements in many different contexts. Only a few of these heuristics (e.g., representativeness heuristic; availability heuris- tic) have been discussed here. Another important heuristic discovered by Kahneman and Tversky is the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: judges use an initial estimate (the anchor) and then adjust it to produce a final estimate; however, the adjustment is typically insufficient. For example, judgements of the number of African countries in the United Nations are systematically biased by initial numbers produced randomly by a roulette wheel (Fiedler & von Sydow, 2015). Kahneman and Tversky established the field of judgement research and their emphasis on the role of heuristics has spread to several other research areas including decision-making (this chapter, pp. 640–663), and reasoning (Chapter 14). Their ideas have also been hugely influential outside psychol- ogy (e.g., in economics and philosophy). There is plentiful evidence that most people frequently prefer to minimise the cognitive demands on them by using heuristics (Fiedler & von Sydow, 2015). There are several limitations with the heuristics and biases approach. First, the heuristics are defined vaguely. As Fiedler and von Sydow (2015, p. 150) pointed out, “One-word labels like ‘representativeness’ are theory surrogates [substitutes] that fail to place any testable constraints on the cognitive decision process.” Second, theorising based on the heuristics-and-biases approach has been limited (but see later discussion, pp. 634–637). According to Fiedler and von Sydow (2015, p. 154), “What is disillusioning and disappointing . . . is how little precision, refinement, and progress has been obtained at the theoretical level.” For example, there is little evidence that the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic depends on an incomplete adjust- ment process rather than a simpler process (e.g., the initial numerical value triggers or primes values similar to it). In addition, the precise conditions that elicited the various heuristics and the relationships between different heuristics remain unspecified. Third, inaccurate judgements are not necessarily due to biased process- ing. Instead, inaccurate judgements often occur because individuals have been exposed to a small and biased sample of information (an environ- mental factor). For example, most people judge skin cancer to be a more common cause of death than cancer of the mouth and throat although the opposite is actually the case (Hertwig et al., 2005). Such findings have been attributed to an internal cause (the availability heuristic). In fact, they are due primarily to the much greater media coverage of skin cancer (an external cause). Fourth, emotional and motivational factors influence our judgements in the real world but were rarely studied in the laboratory until relatively recently (see Chapter 15). For example, the judged risk from formaldehyde (a toxic chemical compound) was greater when individuals were in a sad rather than neutral mood (Lench & Darbor, 2014). Fifth, it has often been argued that the cognitive biases (e.g., failure to take account of the underlying base rate) observed in much research are KEY TERM Anchoring-and- adjustment heuristic When someone makes an initial estimate (the anchor) and then adjusts it to produce a final estimate, the adjustment is generally insufficient.

Reasons why our judgements might be more accurate under more naturalistic conditions are discussed next. Natural frequency hypothesis We are rarely presented with summary statistics providing base-rate information in our everyday lives although this is common in laboratory research. Instead, what is common in our everyday experience is natural sampling – “the process of encountering instances in a population sequen- tially” (McDowell & Jacobs, 2017, p. 425). According to Gigerenzer and Hoffrage (1995), our evolutionary history makes it easy for us to calculate the frequencies of different kinds of events. In contrast, we are ill-equipped to deal with fractions and percentages: this helps to explain why we often perform so poorly on judgement problems involving base rates. The central prediction is that performance on such problems would be greatly enhanced if natural frequencies were used. This theoretical approach poses some problems. First, we encoun- ter only a sample of events in the real world, and the frequencies of such events may differ substantially from “natural” samples. For example, the frequencies of highly intelligent and less intelligent people encountered by university students differ from those in the general population. Second, we must distinguish between natural frequencies and the word problems actually used in research. With most word problems, participants receive frequency information and so bypass the complexities of natural sampling. Findings Gigerenzer and Hoffrage (1995) presented a judgement task closely resem- bling the mammogram problem used by Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007; discussed earlier, pp. 626–627). When the problem was presented in proba- bilities, only 16% of participants produced the correct answer. In contrast, 46% of participants were correct when frequencies were used. McDowell and Jacobs (2017) reported a meta-analysis (see Glossary) of studies comparing performance on judgement tasks using probabilities or natural frequencies. Overall, there was a clear-cut advantage when natural frequencies were presented. Performance on tasks presented using probabil- ities was improved when the task was made easier by presenting a limited amount of information or by using visual aids. However, these manipula- tions also improved performance on tasks using natural frequencies. Even individuals with much relevant knowledge benefit from frequency information. Hoffrage et al. (2015) used four realistic diagnostic tasks requiring use of base-rate information in probability or natural frequency versions with advanced medical students. These tasks varied in complexity (e.g., the number of relevant cues; more than two possible hypotheses). Correct judgements on each task were far more common with the natural frequency than the probability version (see Figure 13.3). Overall, 45% of natural frequency problems were solved correctly compared to only 7% of probability problems.

(2000) used a problem where there was an 80% chance a woman with breast cancer would have a positive mammogram compared to 9.6% for a woman without breast cancer. The base rate of breast cancer in women is 1%. Participants engaged in frequency sampling cards from files organised into the categories of women with and without breast cancer to decide the probability that a woman has breast cancer if she has a pos- itive mammogram. Participants’ sampling was heavily biased towards women with breast cancer because they mistakenly believed that category was more informa- tive. This led them to produce an average estimate of 63% a woman has breast cancer given a positive mammogram (the correct answer is 7.8%). The participants performed poorly because they engaged in biased fre- quency sampling. Evaluation The natural frequency hypothesis has two major apparent strengths. First, we often use information based on natural sampling when making judge- ments in everyday life. Second, judgements are often more accurate when based on natural frequency rather than probability information. What are the limitations of the hypothesis? (1) Enhanced performance with frequency versions may be due to its “computational simplicity” (Amitani, 2015) rather than because evo- lution has equipped us to process frequency information efficiently. So far research has not resolved this theoretical controversy (McDowell & Jacobs, 2017). (2) It is generally assumed participants make accurate judgements because they use Bayes theorem (discussed earlier, p. 623). However, Domurat et al. (2015) found that, using a natural sampling approach, partici- pants sometimes produced accurate judgements by using a simpler 100 90 59% 46% 38% Probabilities Natural frequencies 38% 6% 6% 16% 1% 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Percentage of correct inferences Task 1 Three cue values Three hypotheses Two cues Three cues Task 2 Task 3 Task 4 Figure 13.3 Percentage of correct inferences on tasks presented in probability of natural frequency versions.

(3) There is often a yawning chasm between people’s actual sampling behaviour and the neat-and-tidy frequency data provided in labora- tory experiments. This can occur because their sampling behaviour is biased due to inaccurate hypotheses (e.g., Fiedler et al., 2000) or because readily accessible information is biased. (4) People sometimes find it harder to think in frequencies than percent- ages. Keeping track of frequency information in the real world can impose considerable demands on memory (Amitani, 2015). THEORIES OF JUDGEMENT Several theories of judgement have been proposed. Below we discuss those theories that have contributed the most to our understanding of the pro- cesses underlying judgement and its biases. Support theory Tversky and Koehler (1994) proposed their support theory based partly on the availability heuristic (discussed earlier, pp. 628–629). Their key assump- tion was that an event appears more or less likely depending on how it is described. Thus, we must distinguish between events and descriptions of those events. You will almost certainly assume the probability you will die on your next summer holiday is extremely low. However, it might seem more likely if you were asked “What is the probability you will die on your next summer holiday from a disease, a car accident, a plane crash, contam- inated food, or any other cause?”. Why is the subjective probability of death on holiday greater in the second case? According to support theory, there are two main reasons: (1) An explicit description draws attention to aspects of the event less obvious in the non-explicit description. (2) Memory limitations may prevent people remembering all the relevant information if it is not supplied. More generally, the subadditivity effect follows from the theory. The sub- additivity effect is “the tendency to judge the probability of the whole set of outcomes to be less than the total probabilities of its parts” (Riege & Teigen, 2017, p. 96). Findings We might assume experts’ probability estimates would not be influenced by the explicitness of descriptions because they can readily provide missing details from their extensive knowledge. However, Redelmeier et al. (1995) disconfirmed this assumption. Expert doctors received the description of a woman with abdominal pain. Half assessed the probabilities of two specified diagnoses (gastroenteritis and ectopic pregnancy) and a residual category KEY TERM Subadditivity effect The judged probability of the whole is less than the combined probabilities of its parts.

The other half assigned probabilities to five specified diag- noses (including gastroenteritis and ectopic pregnancy) and everything else. The key comparison was the subjective probability of all diagnoses other than gastroenteritis and ectopic pregnancy. It was .50 with the non-explicit description but .69 with the explicit (more detailed) one. Thus, subjective probabilities were higher for explicit descriptions even with experts. Riege and Teigen (2017) obtained strong evidence for the subadditivity effect. Participants were given the names and descriptions of the five actors nominated for the best actor award at the 2014 Oscars and indicated the probability of each one winning. The sum of the five probabilities came to 156% (the correct figure must be 100%). Sloman et al. (2004) found participants estimated the probability an American person selected at random would die of disease rather than some other cause was .55. The probability was similar when three typical dis- eases (heart disease, cancer, stroke) were explicitly mentioned. However, it was only .40 when three atypical diseases (pneumonia, diabetes, cirrhosis) were mentioned. Thus, an explicit description can reduce subjective prob- ability (rather than increase it as predicted theoretically) if it leads us to focus on low-probability causes. Limitations Support theory has various limitations. First, the theory does not explain in detail why providing an explicit description generally increases an event’s subjective probability. However, Hilbert (2012) argued the processes con- verting objective evidence into subjective estimates are “noisy”, leading us to overestimate the probabilities of events having an objectively low prob- ability. This leads to subadditivity and also explains several other cognitive biases. Second, the theory is oversimplified because it assumes the perceived support for a given hypothesis provided by relevant evidence is independent of the support for rival hypotheses. However, we often compare hypotheses and so this independence assumption is incorrect (Pleskac, 2012). Third, support theory cannot easily explain Sloman et al.’s (2004) finding that superadditivity (the opposite of subadditivity) is found when explicit descriptions focus on low-probability causes. This probably happens because focusing participants’ attention on low-probability causes reduces their awareness of high-probability ones. Fast-and-frugal heuristics We have seen our judgements are often inaccurate because we rely on various heuristics. In contrast, Gigerenzer and colleagues (e.g., Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011) argued heuristics are often very valuable when judging probabilities and making decisions. Their central focus is on fast-and-frugal heuristics involving rapid processing of limited information. They assumed we possess an “adaptive toolbox” consisting of several such heuristics which are often surprisingly accurate. The take-the-best heuristic is a key fast-and-frugal heuristic based on “take the best, ignore the rest”.

You might assume the most valid cue is that cities whose names you recognise have larger populations than unrecognised cities. However, you recognise both names. After that, you think of another valid cue to city size (e.g., cities with cathedrals tend to be larger than those without). Since you know Cologne has a cathedral but are unsure about Herne, you say Cologne. The take-the-best strategy has three components: (1) search rule: search cues (e.g., name recognition; cathedral) in decreas- ing order of validity; (2) stopping rule: stop after finding a discriminatory cue (i.e., the cue applies to only one option). (3) decision rule: choose outcome. The recognition heuristic (selecting the recognised object rather than the unrecognised object) is a much researched example of the take-the- best strategy. In the example above, if you recognise the name Cologne but not Herne, you guess (correctly) Cologne is the larger city. Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002) argued controversially that when individuals rec- ognise one object but not the other, no other information influences their judgement. How do people decide which heuristic to use on judgement or deci- sion-making tasks? Kruglanski and Gigerenzer (2011) argued there is a two-step process. First, the nature of the task and individual memory limit the number of available heuristics. Second, individuals select one heuristic based on the likely outcome of using it and its processing demands. Findings Evidence indicating the importance of the recognition heuristic was reported by Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002). American students were pre- sented with pairs of German cities and decided which was larger. When only one city name was recognised, participants apparently used the recog- nition heuristic 90% of the time. However, selecting the recognised city does not necessarily mean the recognition heuristic was used – it could have been chosen for other reasons. In another study, Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002) told participants that German cities with football teams tend to be larger than those without. When participants decided whether a recognised city without a football team was larger or smaller than an unrecognised city, participants apparently used the recognition heuristic 92% of the time. Thus, as pre- dicted theoretically, they mostly ignored conflicting information about the absence of a football team. Basehore and Anderson (2016) presented participants with pairs of fic- titious cities (having pre-exposed them to one in each pair) and asked them to select the one with the larger population. This approach has the advan- tage that recognition was manipulated experimentally so its impact could be assessed unconfounded by any other differences between the two cities. As predicted, selections consistent with the recognition heuristic were made on 74% of trials.

For example, suppose participants must decide which of two Italian cities has the larger population or is higher above sea level. Unsurprisingly, the recognition heuristic is more valid with the former decision and is also used more often (Pohl et al., 2017). Most people are sensitive to validity: Pachur et al. (2012b) obtained a correlation of +.64 between usage of the recogni- tion heuristic and its validity in a meta-analysis. Controversially, it is assumed that use of the recognition heuristic means no other knowledge is taken into account. In contrast, it is assumed within the parallel constraint satisfaction theory (e.g., Glöckner et al., 2014) that all available information is integrated “automatically” in par- allel. Heck and Erdfelder (2017) compared predictions from the two the- ories with respect to decisions with pairs of objects, one recognised and the other not. According to the parallel constraint satisfaction theory, the more information available, the faster the decision times. According to the recognition heuristic account, in contrast, decision times should be slower when influenced by additional information. Heck and Erdfelder (2017) carried out a meta-analysis of decision times based on 19 data sets. Their findings were striking: 87.5% of partici- pants performed as predicted by the parallel constraint satisfaction theory. In contrast, only 11.3% conformed to predictions based on the recognition heuristic. More evidence that people often utilise additional information, even when the recognition heuristic could be used on its own, was reported by Richter and Späth (2006). German students were asked to decide, which of two American cities was larger. The recognised city was identified as larger more often when they were told it had an international airport than when told it did not: 98% vs 82%, respectively. Dummel et al. (2016) focused on participants making decisions con- sistent with the take-the-best strategy (i.e., based on the best cue). When the next-best cue conflicted with the best cue, participants inhibited infor- mation about that cue and made slower decisions than when the two cues did not conflict. Thus, the next-best cue was processed even though theo- retically it should not have been. The take-the-best strategy is used less often than predicted theoreti- cally (Fiedler & von Sydow, 2015). For example, Newell et al. (2003) had participants choose between the shares of two fictitious companies. Only 33% used all three components of the take-the-best strategy. This strategy was least likely to be used when the cost of obtaining information was low and cue validities were unknown. In those circumstances, participants used more complex processes than those associated with the take-the-best strategy. Gigerenzer’s theoretical approach is based on a toolbox metaphor: different strategies (e.g., take-the-best) are chosen in different situations. Söllner and Bröder (2016) contrasted that approach with one based on an adjustable spanner metaphor: the same strategy is used in different situa- tions, but it is used flexibly. The amount of information participants chose to acquire before making a decision was better predicted by the adjustable spanner metaphor.

Such heuristics involve more pre- cisely spelled-out mechanisms than those emphasised by Kahneman and Tversky (Fiedler & von Sydow, 2015). These heuristics can be surprisingly effective despite their simplicity. Factors determining strategy selection on judgement tasks have been identified. The fast-and-frugal approach accounts for much applied decision-making (discussed later in the chapter, p. 655). What are the limitations of this theoretical approach? First, as Evans and Over (2010, p. 174) pointed out, “The suggestion that we are always better off following intuitions and ‘gut feelings’ is an extraordinary claim. Why would we have the capacity for logical reasoning if it was of no value?” Second, the assumption that the recognition heuristic is often used with additional information being ignored is often wrong (e.g., Heck & Erdfelder, 2017). Many findings are better explained by other theories (e.g., parallel constraint satisfaction theory). It is also likely people consider why they recognise an object before deciding whether to use the recognition heuristic (Newell, 2011). Third, the take-the-best strategy is used less often than suggested the- oretically. Its use requires us to organise the various cues hierarchically based on their validity, but often we lack adequate knowledge of cue valid- ities. Lawrence et al. (2018) discovered that the precise cues used by indi- viduals depend on their accessibility in memory, a factor not emphasised by Gigerenzer. Another issue is that people often use information (e.g., about the next-best cue) that theoretically should be ignored with the take- the-best strategy. Fourth, the approach de-emphasises the importance of the decision. Decision-making may stop after finding a single discriminatory cue when deciding which of two cities is larger. However, most women want to consider all the relevant evidence before deciding which of two men to marry! Dual-process theory: Kahneman (2003) Most people rely heavily on heuristics when making judgements because they can be used rapidly and effortlessly. However, individuals sometimes use more complex cognitive processes. As a result, some theorists (e.g., De Neys, 2012; Kahneman, 2003) have proposed dual-process models. Similar models have also been applied to performance on reasoning problems (see Chapter 14). According to Kahneman (2003), probability judgments depend on pro- cessing within two systems: System 1: “The operations of System 1 are typically fast, automatic, effortless, implicit (not open to introspection) and often emotionally charged; they are also difficult to control or modify” (Kahneman, 2003, p. 698).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n638 Thinking and reasoning System 2: “The operations of System 2 are slower, serial [one at a time], effortful, more likely to be consciously monitored and deliberately controlled; they are relatively flexible and potentially rule- governed” (Kahneman, 2003, p. 698). How are these two systems related? System 1 rapidly generates intuitive answers to judgement problems (e.g., those based on the representativeness heuristic). These answers are then monitored or evaluated by System 2, which may correct them. Thus, judgement involves serial processing start- ing with System 1 and sometimes followed by System 2. Morewedge and Kahneman (2010) subsequently modified the above aspect of the theory, arguing that System 1 and System 2 processes “can operate in parallel” (p. 439). They also argued that System 1 processes cause some information to become strongly activated. This information is then often overweighed and leads to biased judgements. Finally, they assumed that System 1 processing often produces errors which may then be corrected by System 2 processing. Findings De Neys (2006) obtained support for Kahneman’s theory using the Linda problem (discussed earlier, pp. 624–625). Those producing the correct answer (and so presumably using System 2) took almost 40% longer than those apparently using only System 1. This is consistent with the assumption it takes longer to use System 2. There was a reduction in correct solutions from 17% to 9.5% when participants performed a cognitively demanding task at the same time. This is as predicted given that System 2 requires cog- nitively demanding processes. De Neys et al. (2011) found on standard base-rate problems that incor- rect answers neglecting base-rate information were obtained on 80% of trials. This suggests participants often totally ignored base-rate informa- tion. However, they were less confident about their responses when they produced incorrect answers than when producing correct ones suggesting there is some processing of base-rate information even when it does not influence people’s judgements. Earlier we discussed the lawyer-engineer problem (p. 624; Kahneman & Tversky, 1973) on which base-rate information is often ignored. Pennycook and Thompson (2012) used similar problems such as the following: In a study 1,000 people were tested. Among the participants there were 995 nurses and 5 doctors. Paul is a randomly chosen participant of this study. Paul is 34 years old. He lives in a beautiful home in a posh suburb. He is well spoken and very interested in politics. He invests a lot of time in his career. What is the probability that Paul is a nurse? (p. 528) There is a conflict between the base-rate information (suggesting Paul is a nurse) and the personality description (suggesting he is a doctor). Use of System 1 processing might lead participants to focus on the personal- ity description using the representativeness heuristic and decide Paul was Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["arged; they are also difficult to control or modify” (Kahneman, 2003, p.","698)."]}

The participants answered each problem twice: initially with the first answer coming to mind and then with a more deliberate answer. On Kahneman’s theory, people must use System 2 processing for their answers to reflect base-rate information. As a result, initial answers should rarely reflect base-rate information but instead should be based on the repre sentativeness heuristic. In addition, base-rate information should be used much more often in deliberate than in initial answers. Neither pre- diction was supported. Half the initial answers were based primarily on base-rate information. Of the participants changing their responses, 30% took more account of base-rate information in their deliberate answer. However, nearly as many (23%) took less account of base-rate information in their deliberate answer which is inconsistent with Kahneman’s theory. Newman et al. (2017) obtained similar findings when instructing par- ticipants to give an immediate answer (“Please provide us with the FIRST ANSWER that comes to mind”) and a more deliberate one. Base-rate information often influenced their immediate answer. Newman et al. con- cluded the distinction between System 1 and System 2 responses should be abandoned. Perhaps responses differ primarily with respect to complexity: “more complex responses . . . are more time-consuming and challenging to produce” (pp. 1165–1166). Chun and Kruglanski (2006) also obtained findings indicating the importance of complexity. They used various versions of the lawyer- engineer problem in which base-rate and personality information was pre- sented. Some information was easy to process because it was presented briefly whereas the remainder was complex (presented at length). Chun and Kruglanski (2006) assessed the effect of cognitive load. According to dual-process theory, cognitive load should reduce System 2 processing and use of base-rate information. In fact, cognitive load led to increased use of easily processed information regardless of whether it referred to base rate or personality. Evaluation There is support for the notion there are two different processing systems, with System 2 being slower and more effortful than System 1 processing. Similar dual-process theories have proved reasonably successful in account- ing for reasoning (Chapter 14). What are the limitations of Kahneman’s (2003) theory? First, and most importantly, there is “the alignment problem” (Melnikoff & Bargh, 2018, p. 281). In essence, it is assumed System 1 processes are unintentional, uncontrollable, unconscious and efficient (i.e., they use minimal processing capacity) whereas System 2 processes are intentional, controllable, con- scious and inefficient. These assumptions have rarely been tested. However, the available evidence indicates strongly that these attributes are much less highly correlated than assumed theoretically (Melnikoff & Bargh). As a consequence, it is not possible to define System 1 processes with precision. Second, and related to the first point, the assumption that rapid judge- ment responses reflect the use of System 1 whereas slow responses reflect the use of System 2 is also oversimplified. In fact, rapid responses often Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["al- ity description using the representativeness heuristic and decide Paul was Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","Judgement and decision-making 639 probably a doctor."]}

Third, there is relatively little support for Kahneman’s (2003) origi- nal assumption that System 1 and System 2 processes occur serially. How can we detect rapidly that responses produced by System 1 are incor- rect if System 2 has not been used up to that point? More generally, the theory fails to provide an explicit account of the monitoring determining whether we decide to use System 2 processes as well as System 1 processes. However, as noted earlier, Morewedge and Kahneman (2010) argued that System 1 and 2 processes could occur in parallel. Fourth, Morewedge and Kahneman (2010) committed the “good/ bad fallacy” (Melnikoff & Bargh, 2018, p. 282). This fallacy involves the assumptions that System 1 processing is often “bad” and error-prone whereas System 2 processing is “good” and leads to rational judgements. Much of the evidence discussed above illustrates the oversimplifications involved in these assumptions. The way forward? Processing on judgement tasks is much more flexible than implied by Kahneman’s (2003) dual-process theory. It is also clear different processes often operate in parallel rather than serially as assumed theoretically. De Neys (2012, 2014) proposed a logical intuition model (see Figure 14.4 on p. 685) to resolve some issues. He argued there is rapid intuitive heuristic processing (System 1) and intuitive logical processing (e.g., of base-rate information) in parallel. This initial processing is sometimes followed by deliberate System 2 processing if the two types of intuitive processing gener- ate different responses. Support for the logical intuition model was reported by Bago et al. (2018). They presented base-rate judgement problems involving conflict between information in the problem and base-rate information. Event- related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) revealed sensitivity to conflict within approximately 200 ms even on trials where participants produced the wrong answer. It is improbable that System 2 processes occurred so rapidly, and so this conflict sensitivity was probably due to System 1 pro- cesses operating in parallel. This model has several advantages over Kahneman’s theory. First, heuristic and base-rate information can both be accessed rapidly through intuitive processing. This is consistent with the findings of Pennycook and Thompson (2012) and Newman et al. (2017). Second, the finding that easily processed base-rate information is often used under high cognitive load (Chun & Kruglanski, 2006) is more consistent with De Neys’ model. Third, the model clarifies how conflicts between heuristic and base-rate information are rapidly detected (e.g., De Neys et al., 2011) and trigger System 2 processes.

At one time, it was assumed people Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nJudgement and decision-making 641 think rationally and so generally select the best option. This assumption was built into normative theories, which focused more on how people should make decisions rather than their actual decisions. Here we will consider von Neumann and Morgenstern’s (1944) expressed utility theory. They argued we try to maximise utility (the subjective value we attach to an outcome). When we choose between simple options, we assess the expected utility or value of each one via the following formula: Expected utility = (probability of a given outcome) × (utility of the outcome). von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) treated decisions as if they were gambles. This approach was subsequently coupled with Savage’s (1954) mathematical approach based on using information from people’s preferences to combine subjective utilities and subjective probabilities. This led to the development of subjective expected utility theory. In the real world, various factors are generally associated with each option. For example, one holiday option may be preferable to another because it is in a more interesting area with better weather. However, the first holiday is more expensive, and more time would be spent travelling. In such circumstances, people allegedly calculate the expected utility or disutility (cost) of each factor to assess the overall expected value or utility of each option. In fact, our choices are often decided by factors other than simply utility. Decisions differ enormously in complexity (e.g., making life choices vs meal choices). We start with relatively simple decision-making. The most influential such theory (prospect theory) will be discussed, followed by the- ories focusing more on emotional and/or social factors. After that, we con- sider more complex decision-making. Losses and gains It is reasonable to assume we make decisions to maximise the chances of making a gain and minimise the chances of making a loss. Suppose someone offered you $200 if a tossed coin came up heads but a loss of $100 if it came up tails. You would jump at the chance (wouldn’t you?) because the bet provides an average expected gain of $50 per throw. Here are two more decisions. Would you prefer a sure gain of $800 or an 85% chance of gaining $1,000 and a 15% probability of gaining nothing? Since the expected value of the latter decision is greater than that of the former ($850 vs $800, respectively), you might well choose the latter option. Finally, would you prefer a sure loss of $800 or an 85% probability of losing $1,000 with a 15% probability of avoiding any loss? The average expected loss is $800 for the former choice and $850 for the latter one, so you go with the former choice, do you not? The first problem was from Tversky and Shafir (1992) and the other two from Kahneman and Tversky (1984). In every case, most participants failed to make what appears to be the best choice. Two-thirds refused to bet on the coin toss and a majority preferred the choices with the smaller expected gain and the larger expected loss! Below we discuss attempts to understand such seemingly irrational decision-making.

Here are two key assumptions: (1) Individuals identify a reference point representing their present state. (2) Individuals are much more sensitive to potential losses than potential gains: loss aversion. This explains why most people are unwilling to accept a 50:50 bet unless the amount they might win is about twice the amount they might lose (Kahneman, 2003). The above assumptions are represented in Figure 13.4. The reference point is where the line labelled losses and gains intersects the line labelled value. The positive value associated with gains increases relatively slowly as gains become greater. Thus, winning £2,000 (2,200 euros) instead of £1,000 (1,100 euros) does not double the subjective value of the money won. In contrast, the negative value associated with losses increases relatively rapidly as losses become greater. How does prospect theory account for the findings discussed earlier? If people are much more sensitive to losses than gains, they should be unwilling to accept bets involving potential losses even when the potential gains outweigh the potential losses. They should also prefer a sure gain to a risky (but potentially greater) gain; this is risk aversion. However, the theory does not predict people will always avoid risky decisions. If offered a chance to avoid a loss, most people will take it because they are so con- cerned to avoid losses: this is risk seeking. Tversky and Kahneman (1992) put forward cumulative prospect theory, which is more comprehensive than prospect theory. However, it “retains the major features of . . . prospect theory” (p. 317). Accordingly, we use the term “prospect theory” to refer to both versions. It is assumed theoretically that people overweigh low-probability events: rare events receive more weight than they should given their actual probability of occurrence. This helps to explain why people bet on the National Lottery where the chances of winning the jackpot are 1 in 14 million. Findings: framing effect Much research has considered the framing effect in which decisions are influenced by irrelevant aspects of the situation. Tversky and Kahneman (1981) used the Asian disease problem to study this effect. All participants were given the following information: KEY TERMS Loss aversion The finding that losses have a greater subjective impact on individuals than gains of the same magnitude. Risk aversion A preference for certain gains over potentially larger (but less certain) gains. Framing effect The finding that decisions can be influenced by situational aspects (e.g., problem wording) irrelevant to optimal decision-making. Figure 13.4 A hypothetical value function.

Two alternative programmes to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimate of the consequences of the program are as follows . . . In the gain-frame condition, participants chose between the following prospects: ● If programme A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. ● If programme B is adopted, there is a 1 in 3 probability 600 people will be saved, and a 2 in 3 probability that no people will be saved. In this condition, 72% chose the certain gain (programme A) even though the two programmes (if implemented several times) would on average both lead to the saving of 200 lives. In the loss-frame condition, participants chose between the following prospects: ● If programme C is adopted, 400 people will die. ● If programme D is adopted, there is a 1 in 3 probability that nobody will die, and 2 in 3 probability that 600 people will die. In this condition, 78% of participants chose programme B. This was the case even though the two programmes would have the same effect if imple- mented several times. Steiger and Kühberger (2018) carried out a meta-analysis based on 81 experimental findings. There was much variation across studies, but the overall framing effect was moderately strong. According to prospect theory, the framing effect occurs because people focus on potential gains in the gain-frame condition whereas they are motivated by loss aversion in the loss-frame condition. Mandel (2014) claimed the framing effect is trivial because it depends on ambiguity about unstated information (e.g., programme A is interpreted as meaning at least 200 people would be saved). However, Chick et al. (2016) still obtained a robust framing effect when all ambiguities were eliminated. Wang (1996) argued performance on the Asian disease problem is influenced by social and moral factors de-emphasised by prospect theory. Participants chose between definite survival of two-thirds of the patients (deterministic option) versus a 1/3 probability of all patients surviving and a 2/3 probability of none surviving (probabilistic option). The deterministic option leads, on average, to the survival of twice as many patients. However, the probabilistic option seems fairer because all patients share the same fate. Participants strongly preferred the determin- istic option when the problem related to six unknown patients. However, they preferred the probabilistic option when it related to six close rela- tives because participants were especially concerned about fairness in that condition.

This effect involves “throw- ing good money after bad”. The sunk-cost effect is found in long-term relationships – the more money and effort individuals have invested in an unhappy relationship, the more likely they are to stay (Rego et al., 2018). In one study, participants were told two people had paid a $100 non-refundable deposit for a weekend at a resort (Dawes, 1988). On the way there, they both became slightly unwell and felt they would probably have a more pleasurable time at home. Many participants argued the two people should drive on to avoid wasting the $100 – the sunk-cost effect. This decision involves extra costs (money spent at the resort) and is less preferred than being at home! One explanation for the sunk-cost effect is that many people would find it embarrassing if others knew they had wasted money or other resources on an abandoned project (see study by Simonson and Staw, 1992, discussed later, p. 653). Domeier et al. (2018) identified another reason. Individuals chose whether to continue with an option in which they had already invested time and money (sunk-cost option) or to switch to an alternative option having a higher probability of being successful. Those choosing the sunk-cost option did so because it satisfied their need to feel competent more than the alternative option (see Figure 13.5). Findings: Loss aversion Loss aversion (greater sensitivity to potential losses than potential gains) is of central importance within prospect theory. Much research involv- ing large amounts of money supports the notion of loss aversion (see also research on experts in the Box below, pp. 645–646). However, this is much less the case with small amounts (Yechiam, 2018). For example, consider the following choice: (1) 50% to win £1 (1.15 euro); 50% to lose £1 (1.15 euro) (2) 50% to win £5 (5.75 euros); 50% to lose (5.75 euros) KEY TERM Sunk-cost effect Investing additional resources to justify a previous commitment that has so far proved unsuccessful. 5 4.5 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 SCO Choice of option Competence satisfaction AO SCO-selectors AO-selectors Figure 13.5 Ratings of competence satisfaction for the sunk- cost option (SCO) and the alternative option (AO) for those selecting the sunk-cost option and those selecting the alternative option.

In fact, the typical finding is loss neutrality – individuals do not favour one option over the other unless the stakes are high (Yechiam & Hochman, 2013). This consistent finding is con- trary to prospect theory. Pachur et al. (2018) argued that attentional processes influence loss aversion. More specifically, individuals who attend more to losses (relative to gains) should exhibit greater loss aversion than those attending more to gains. Pachur et al. manipulated participants’ attention to losses and gains and obtained their predicted findings. In similar fashion, the loss neutrality with small stakes found by Yechiam and Hochman (2013) depends in part because small potential losses do not attract much attention. IN THE REAL WORLD: LOSS AVERSION AND RISK AVERSION IN EXPERTS Most research on prospect theory is laboratory-based, raising doubts about its real-world appli- cability. First, individuals taking risks to avoid losses in the laboratory using hypothetical money may not do so in everyday life. Second, most participants performing laboratory tasks have limited relevant experience. In contrast, experts in the real world might know how to prevent biases (e.g., loss aversion) from influencing their behaviour and reducing their income.

Loss aversion would lead them to be more cautious when putting for a birdie than for par. In the latter case, failure to hole the putt would produce a bogey and thus a loss. Pope and Schweitzer (2011) studied 2½ million putts by professional golfers. Par putts were less likely than same-length birdie putts to stop short of the hole (indicative of loss aversion). Loss aversion was found in 94% of golfers (including Tiger Woods). McFall (2016) reported additional evidence of loss aversion among professional golfers playing par five holes. Golfers penalised for hitting their tee shot out of bounds adopted a riskier approach to playing the rest of the hole than those not penalised. This attempt to avoid loss (i.e., a bogey or worse) was ineffective because it impaired their performance. Eil and Lien (2014) studied very experienced poker players. In spite of their expertise, they typ- ically played more aggressively (i.e., betting and raising more often) when losing (indicating loss aversion). In addition, as predicted by prospect theory, they were risk averse when winning. Abdellaoui et al. (2013) studied financial professionals handling an average of £200 million (230 million euros) each. As prospect theory predicts, they were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses on a money-based task. Their risk aversion for gains was comparable to students but they were less loss averse than students (see Figure 13.6). In sum, experts in several different areas show clear evidence of loss aversion when losing. They also exhibit risk aversion when winning. Thus, prospect theory is applicable to the real world. Findings: description-experience gap Most research on prospect theory has used a description-based approach where outcomes and their associated probabilities are presented explicitly. There is also an experience-based approach where information about out- comes and associated outcomes is acquired through sampling. Wulff et al. (2018) carried out a meta-analysis of relevant research. Overall, there was a robust description-experience gap: individuals are more likely to overweigh the probability of rare events when exposed to descriptions than when expe- riencing events. Since prospect theory predicts that rare events should be overweighed, the description-based findings are apparently more consistent with the theory than the experience-based findings. How can we explain the description-experience gap? The single most important factor is a sampling error when the experience-based approach is used because participants making decisions from experience often fail to encounter rare events. However, Wulff et al. (2018) found there was still a description-experience gap (but much smaller) when experienced frequen- cies of events closely resembled actual probabilities. Glöckner et al. (2016) pointed out that nearly all studies finding a description-experience gap had compared choices of a certain option against a risky option. This could partially explain the gap because cer- tainty of outcome cannot be achieved in experience. When Glöckner et al. avoided using certain options, they consistently obtained a reversal of the description-experience gap (i.e., a reverse description-experience gap, or a greater overweighting of rare events in decisions made from experience than from descriptions). Thus, the relationship between experience-based and description-based decision-making is more complex than usually assumed. In sum, description-experience gaps are of importance for various reasons.

Consider Nik Wallenda, the American tightrope walker known as “the King of the Wire” (Newell, 2015). On 23 June 2013, he walked along a wire suspended 1,500 feet above the Grand Canyon without a safety harness or safety net. The conditions were windy, and at one point Wallenda said “Winds are way worse than I expected”. However, he successfully reached the other side. Most people would never consider making Nik Wallenda’s life-threatening decision. How can we explain his decision-making? He focused very much on the gains: “I do this because I love what I do . . . Walking the wire to me is life.” Most importantly, his strong Christian faith allowed him to minimise potential losses: “I know where I’m going to go when I die . . . I’m not scared of dying.” His friend Michael Mascitto said that Wallenda had realised that “God is giving him a platform to use his abilities for God’s glory”. Nik Wallenda at the Grand Canyon.

Second, prospect theory cannot provide a coherent account of the different description-experience gaps reported in the literature. Third, descriptions have been used to test most aspects of prospect theory. We need to assess experience-based decisions much more often to test the generality of find- ings obtained based solely on descriptions. Findings: individual differences Prospect theory de-emphasises individual differences (see discussion above of Nik Wallenda). Consider research on the show Deal or No Deal, a game of chance on which contestants can win or lose large sums of money. As predicted by prospect theory, most participants are risk averse, especially when the stakes are high (Brooks et al., 2009). However, there are large individual differences in willingness to take risks even with very high stakes. Narcissism, a personality dimension involving excessive self-regard, was studied by Foster et al. (2011). Individuals high in narcissism engaged in riskier stock-market investing because they have high sensitivity to reward but low sensitivity to punishment. According to prospect theory, people should be risk averse for gains but risk seeking to avoid losses. Contrary evidence was reported by Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero (2017). Only 25% of participants showed the expected pattern whereas 44% were consistently risk averse or risk seeking for both gains and losses (21% risk averse and 23% risk seeking).

Individuals especially motivated to avoid regret are consistently risk averse whereas those attaching less concern to possible regret are more likely to be consistently risk seeking. Evaluation Prospect theory represents a substantial advance over previous approaches (e.g., subjective expected utility theory). The value function (especially the notion that losses loom larger than gains) accounts for many phenomena (e.g., loss aversion; sunk-cost effect; framing effect). The theory has wide applicability as has been shown by the discovery that professional golfers, experienced poker players and financiers all show loss aversion. More generally, prospect theory was crucial in the development of behavioural economics – using a knowledge of psychological processes to understand economic decision-making. What are prospect theory’s limitations? First, “[It] lacks any unifying principle that might explain why such preferences [e.g., loss aversion] exist” (Houston et al., 2014, p. 502). Part of the answer may lie in our evolu- tionary history (McDermott et al., 2008). For example, engaging in risky behaviour may be optimal for someone starving, whereas it makes evolu- tionary sense to minimise risk when resources are abundant. However, this approach needs to consider whether individuals’ ability to predict likely future conditions influences their tendency to engage in risky behaviour (Mallpress et al., 2015). Second, the reference point is a cornerstone of prospect theory (see Figure 13.4) because it determines whether any given outcome is desir able or undesirable. Terzi et al. (2016) provided participants with several pos- sible reference points (e.g., the average payoff received by other partici- pants; the experimenter’s prediction as to the individual participant’s likely payoff). Participants chose different reference points. Lack of clarity about participants’ reference points makes it hard to test theoretical predictions. Third, prospect theory has little to say about the cognitive processes underlying the various decision-making biases. However, Pachur et al. (2018) found that variations in loss aversion depended in part on partici- pants’ allocation of attention, showing the value of considering cognitive processes. Fourth, much research is artificial because participants receive summary descriptions of the relevant probabilities and outcomes rather than experiencing them directly as in real life. There is sometimes less support for prospect theory with more naturalistic conditions (e.g., Wulff et al., 2018). Fifth, loss aversion occurs less often than predicted by the theory (Yechiam, 2018). This is especially the case when decision-making involves relatively small amounts of money. Sixth, individual differences in the willingness to make risky decisions are de-emphasised. For example, the theory does not predict that many people are risk averse (or risk seeking) for both gains and losses. Seventh, prospect theory also de-emphasises the impact of social and emotional factors (Newell, 2015; see below, pp. 649–654).

DECISION-MAKING: EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS Emotional factors are important in decision-making because winning and losing both have emotional consequences. The underlying processes involved are discussed here. Social factors are also important. Laboratory decisions are rarely taken in a social context. However, we often need to justify our decisions to others in our everyday lives. Consider a contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? deciding whether to attempt a question when there are two possible answers left. If they answer correctly, they gain £75,000 (82,000 euros), but they lose £25,000 (27,300 euros) if they are wrong. In strict financial terms, the balance of advantage lies with answering the question. Suppose, however, the contestant’s family is poor, and their lives would be transformed by taking home the money already won. In that case, the social context strongly indicates the contestant should take the money. Social factors influencing decision-making are discussed later. Emotional factors The effects of emotion on decision-making are complex. Giorgetta et al. (2013) studied gambling with the choices made by the participant or a com- puter. When participants lost, they experienced regret if they had made the decision, but disappointment if the computer had. Regret was followed by riskier choices than disappointment. Wins were experienced as rejoicing (personal choices) or elation (computer choices), with elation being fol- lowed by riskier choices. Overall, the findings were more consistent with prospect theory when participants had a sense of personal agency (i.e., regret and rejoicing conditions). According to Kahneman (2011, p. 287), “Humans described by pros- pect theory are guided by the immediate emotional impact of gains and losses.” The details of what is involved are unclear in prospect theory. However, here are two plausible predictions stemming from prospect theory (Charpentier et al., 2016): (1) The theory assumes there is diminishing sensitivity to changes in value as gains and losses increase (see Figure 13.4). It might be pre- dicted the same diminishing sensitivity would be found for feelings associated with gains and losses. (2) The theory assumes the subjective value of a given loss is greater than the impact of an equivalent gain (see Figure 13.4) and this produces loss aversion. We might predict feelings would be influenced more by a given loss than an equivalent gain. Charpentier et al. (2016) tested the above predictions. They obtained strong support for the first prediction with both expected (anticipated) and experi- enced feelings associated with gains and losses.

There was also evidence for Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n650 Thinking and reasoning impact bias – the impact of given losses or gains was greater on expected feelings than on experienced feelings. Charpentier et al. (2016, p. 768) surprisingly failed to support the second prediction: “When feelings associated with losses and gains are evaluated separately . . . losses are not experienced more intensely than gains.” How, then, can we explain loss aversion? Individuals often make loss-averse decisions because they attend more to (and weigh more heavily) the negative feelings anticipated from loss than the positive feelings antici- pated from gain. Note that we saw the impact of attentional processes on loss aversion earlier in the chapter (Pachur et al., 2018). Suter et al. (2016) distinguished between decision-making when the negative prospects are affect-poor (e.g., monetary losses) and when they are affect-rich (e.g., medical side effects). They investigated whether pros- pect theory could explain findings from both affect-poor and affect-rich problems. With affect-rich problems, participants imagined they suffered from an unspecified illness requiring medication. They chose between two medications each producing a given side effect with some probability (e.g., medication A: insomnia with a probability of 15%; medication B: fever with a probability of 10%). With affect-poor problems, participants chose between two monetary lotteries each leading to a given amount of loss with some probability. The findings are shown in Figure 13.7. First, the decisions made by over 90% of participants with affect-poor problems conformed to expec- tations from prospect theory, whereas the comparable figure was much less with affect-rich problems. Second, many more participants used the minimax rule (ignoring probabilities), which is inconsistent with prospect theory, and focusing only on outcomes, i.e., unpleasantness of the possible side effects) with affect-rich problems. In sum, prospect theory is much less applicable to affect-rich choices than affect-poor ones.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nJudgement and decision-making 651 Omission bias and status quo bias There is other evidence that emotional factors influence decision-making. One example is omission bias, a preference for inaction to action with risky decision-making. For example, British parents were asked questions about having their children inoculated against various diseases (Brown et al., 2010). They were willing to accept a greater risk of their children having a disease than of their children suffering adverse reactions to vaccination. Omission bias with respect to having children vaccinated occurs because parents believe this would increase their anticipated responsibility and regret (Wroe et al., 2005). Even experts exhibit omission bias. Pulmonologists (experts in treat- ing lung disease) received scenarios involving an evaluation of pulmonary embolism and treatment of septic shock (Aberegg et al., 2005). They were significantly less likely to select the best management strategy when they had the option of doing nothing. Feldman and Albarracin (2017) found social norms (accepted standards of behaviour) influenced regret following action and inaction. Perceived regret was greater for action than inaction when social norms favoured inaction. However, this effect was much reduced (or even reversed) when social norms favoured action. Brewer et al. (2016) conducted a meta-analytic study focusing on action vs inaction with respect to health behaviour and anticipated regret. Anticipated regret strongly predicted whether individuals engaged in action or inaction. Thus, action regret was associated with inaction and inaction regret was associated with action. Overall, anticipated regret predicted individuals’ behaviour more strongly than did other negative emotions (e.g., worry). Another example of decision avoidance caused by emotional factors is status quo bias – individuals often prefer to accept the status quo (current state) rather than change their decision. For example, many individuals maintain the same allocation of retirement funds year after year even when no costs would be incurred by changing (Samuelson & Zeckhauser, 1988). Nicolle et al. (2011) found mistaken rejection of the status quo trig- gered stronger feelings of regret than mistaken acceptance of the status quo. In addition, mistaken rejection of the status quo was associated with greater activation in brain regions (medial prefrontal cortex; insula) asso- ciated with regret. Anderson (2003) proposed a rational-emotional model to account for decision avoidance. Within the model, the omission and status quo biases were both explained in terms of regret and fear. We have seen regret is important. Fear is relevant because it reduces when someone decides to defer making a decision. Anderson’s (2003) model cannot explain why individuals often experi- ence more regret for inaction than errors of action when asked a long time afterwards (Leach & Plaks, 2009). It also fails to explain why status quo bias is more common when decision-makers have numerous options rather than just a few (Dean et al., 2017). Finally, status quo bias is found even with trivial decisions (e.g., deciding whether to switch television channels: Esteves-Sorenson & Perrett, 2012). It is hard to believe regret or fear lie KEY TERMS Omission bias A biased preference for risking harm through inaction compared to risking harm through action. Status quo bias A preference for maintaining the status quo (present state) rather than acting to change their decision.

Brain mechanisms We can obtain additional insights into the role of emotion in risky deci- sion-making by studying patients with damage to brain areas associated with emotion. Shiv et al. (2005) used a gambling task where the most profitable strategy was to gamble on every round. Patients with damage to emotion regions (amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and insula) gambled significantly more often than other brain-damaged patients and healthy controls, and thus gained the most money. Why was this? The other two groups were much less likely to gamble immediately following a loss. In contrast, the patients with damage to emotion areas were totally unaffected by the outcome of the previous round. The above findings do not mean emotional involvement necessarily impairs decision-making. Seo and Barrett (2007) studied decision-making performance on a stock-investment simulation among experienced stock investors. Those reporting more intense feelings performed better than those with less intense feelings because they had a good understanding of their emotions. Kandasamy et al. (2016) studied individuals’ sensitivity to their own bodily stimuli (interoception). Financial traders working on a London trading floor showed superior interoceptive ability by perceiving their own heartbeats more accurately than controls. Interestingly, traders with the highest interoceptive ability generated greater profits and survived longer in the financial markets. These findings suggest “gut feeling” is important for successful risk taking. Research has clarified the roles of specific brain areas in risky deci- sion-making. De Martino et al. (2010) studied loss aversion in two women (SP and AP) with severe damage to the amygdala (see Glossary; and Chapter 15). Neither had loss aversion, suggesting the amygdala acts as a “cautionary brake”. Sokol-Hessner et al. (2013) studied risky financial decision-making. Participants instructed to engage in emotion regula- tion (designed to reduce their emotional involvement in the task) showed reduced loss aversion. Other findings suggested this happened because emotion regulation decreased amygdala responses to losses. Patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex display elevated risk-taking behaviour with respect to potential gains and losses especially when the probability of success is low (e.g., Weller et al., 2007). Studer et al. (2015) investigated the impact of damage to the ventro medial prefrontal cortex using a task assessing risk-sensitive decision-making. They distinguished between risk appetite (overall level of betting) and risk adjustment (adjusting bets to take account of the probability of winning). What did Studer et al. (2015) find? The patients showed greater risk appetite than healthy controls (especially when risk taking was disadvan- tageous) and poorer risk adjustment. Unsurprisingly, their betting perfor- mance was poor. Thus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a key role in processing of risk and in successful decision-making under risk.

He argued people often act like intuitive politicians: “They are accountable to a variety of constituencies . . . their long-term success at managing impressions hinges on their skill at anticipating objec- tions that others are likely to raise to alternative courses of action” (p. 454). Simonson and Staw (1992) studied the effects of accountability on decision- making in a study on the sunk-cost effect (see Glossary; see p. 644). Some participants were told their decisions would be shared with instructors and other students (high-accountability condition) whereas others were told their decisions would be confidential (low-accountability condition). High- accountability participants were more likely to continue with their previ- ously ineffective course of action. They showed a stronger sunk-cost effect because they experienced a greater need to justify their previous decisions. Tetlock and Boettger (1994) found that accountability influenced per- formance when participants decided on the acceptability of a new drug (Carozile) that was not yet on the market. Participants were told it would probably save many lives but would also probably cause many deaths. There was much more evidence of the status quo bias (maintaining the present state but not accepting the drug) when they felt accountable for their decision. Accountability pressures also influence experts’ decisions (see Box). Schwartz et al. (2004) asked medical experts to choose treatment for a patient with osteoarthritis. Their decision-making was more biased when they were made accountable for their decision by writing an explanation for it and agreeing to be contacted later to discuss it. IN THE REAL WORLD: POLITICIANS’ DECISION-MAKING It has sometimes been argued (e.g., Axelrod, 2015) that many (or most) politicians are experts at decision-making because they work in an environment requiring numerous decisions. A counter- argument is that politicians’ decisions are often open to public scrutiny (and thus accountability) which might increase their tendency to make biased decisions. For example, politicians in the United Kingdom (and elsewhere) often greatly increase spending on failing projects: this is basi- cally the sunk-cost effect. Sheffer et al. (2018) presented participants with a sunk-cost decision scenario involving a failing government scheme to provide loans to small businesses. The participants consisted of politicians and population samples from three countries. The proportions voting to extend the loan pro- gramme are shown in Figure 13.8. Politicians showed more evidence of the sunk-cost effect in all three countries. Sheffer et al. (2018) also studied the status quo bias (see Glossary) in politicians and population samples. Participants decided whether to whether to abandon the present economy policy plan in favour of a different plan that would increase economic growth but also increase the budget deficit. What findings would we expect? Earlier we discussed findings indicating that high accountability increases the probability that individuals will show the status quo bias (Tetlock & Boettger, 1994). Suppose we assume politicians experience greater feelings of accountability than non-politicians Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["specially those relating to emotion) at the conscious or non- conscious level.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

That would lead us to predict politicians would show more evidence of the status quo bias (i.e., sticking with the present plan). Sheffer et al. (2018) obtained the predicted findings. In sum, politicians are more prone to various decision-making biases (sunk-cost effect; status quo effect) than other people. These findings help to explain some of the poor decisions made by politicians and suggest that accountability can distort the decision-making process. 0.3 All Proportion voting to extend (predicted probabilities) Belgium Canada Israel 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Figure 13.8 Proportion of politicians (circles) and population samples (diamonds) in Belgium, Canada and Israel voting to extend a loan programme (proportions above 0.5 indicate the sunk- cost effect). From Sheffer et al., 2018. The social functionalist approach could be developed to account for cul- tural factors. Consider the distinction between individualistic cultures (emphasising individual responsibility) and collectivistic cultures (emphasis- ing interpersonal relationships). Those living in individualistic cultures are more sensitive to losses and so exhibit more loss aversion than those in col- lectivistic cultures (Wang et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018). The above findings can be interpreted by the cushion hypothesis, according to which the social support provided by others in collectivistic cultures provides a “cushion” for potential financial losses. What are the limitations with the social functionalist approach? First, individual differences in the extent to which people feel the need to justify themselves to others are de-emphasised. Second, most research has involved laboratory tasks lacking real demands on social responsibility. Third, we have a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. For example, increased accountability often changes decisions but the role of cognitive processes (e.g., attention; deliberate or analytic thinking) remains largely unexplored.

For example, medical experts make life- or-death diagnostic decisions (see Chapter 12). Some other decisions are also both important and complex (e.g., “Should I marry John?”; “Should I move to Australia?”). Second, laboratory-based decision-makers typically make a single decision. In contrast, in real life we often make several deci- sions over time as we strive towards important goals (e.g., establishing a career). Fast-and-frugal heuristics: applied decision-making It seems reasonable to assume effective real-world decision-making typically involves complex strategies. In contrast, advocates of the fast-and- frugal approach (e.g., Gigerenzer, 2014; discussed earlier, pp. 634–637), assume simple heuristics or rules of thumb can be more effective than complex strategies. The approach based on fast-and-frugal heuristics explains some deci- sions in applied settings (see Hafenbrädl et al., 2016). For example, the fast-and-frugal approach has been applied to investment decision-making. DeMiguel et al. (2009) compared a simple heuristic (1/N: allocate funds equally to each of N funds) against 14 other much more complex models including the mean-variance portfolio, which won its creator (Harry Markowitz) the Nobel Prize in economics. None of these complex models was consistently better than 1/N. How can this be? Complex models are very sensitive to past data about stocks. However, they are sensitive to “noise” in the data as well as its underlying structure which leads to overly complex and distorted models. How can doctors decide whether a patient with acute vestibular syn- drome (symptoms include vertigo, nausea and unsteady gait) has had a stroke? They can use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but that is expen- sive. A much cheaper (and easier) approach is to administer three short tests of abnormalities in eye movements and then apply a simple tallying heuristic – a stroke is diagnosed if at least one test indicates abnormality. Newman-Toker et al. (2013) found strokes were detected more often using this heuristic than with MRI, both typically used within two days of arrival at a medical centre. In sum, the approach based on fast-and-frugal heuristics sometimes provides reasonable decisions in complex situations. As discussed earlier, an issue with this approach is whether it is really as simple as is gen- erally assumed. For example, there are unresolved problems relating to how we acquire the various heuristics and how decision-makers select the most appropriate heuristic for a given problem (Otworowska et al., 2018). Complex decision-making In an ideal world, our decision-making would involve strategies maximising utility (the subjective desirability of an outcome). Such strategies “involve exhaustive computations based on perfect knowledge of decision-relevant information, possible choices, and their outcome probabilities and conse- quences” (Oh et al., 2016, p. 1937).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n656 Thinking and reasoning Multi-attribute utility theory (see Dyer, 2016) is an approximation to an ideal strategy involving the following stages: (1) Identify attributes relevant to the decision. (2) Decide how to weigh those attributes. (3) List all options under consideration. (4) Rate each option on each attribute. (5) Obtain a total utility (i.e., subjective desirability for each option by summing its weighted attribute values) and select the one with the highest weighted total. We can see this theory’s workings by considering someone deciding which flat to rent. First, the relevant attributes (e.g., number of rooms; rent per week) are identified. Second, the relative utility of each attribute is calcu- lated. Third, the flat with the highest total utility is chosen. It has often been assumed that individuals rarely adopt this optimal strategy. They typically possess incomplete knowledge of decision- relevant information and they are constrained by processing limitations (e.g., small short-term memory capacity). However, some evidence sug- gests that individuals can approximate to this optimal strategy provided the decision-making task is only moderately complex. For example, Brusovansky et al. (2018) asked participants acting as job interviewers to choose one of two candidates based on the candidates’ attributes (3, 4 or 5 attributes) and the importance of those attributes (weights of 1, 2, 3 or 4). Participants were required to make rapid decisions (mean response time was 1.5 seconds). What did Brusovansky et al. (2018) find? Mean overall accuracy was 86% in spite of the speed of responding (varying between 90% for 3-attribute problems and 84% for 5-attribute problems). The key finding was that 59% of the participants used a strategy approximating that assumed by multi- attribute utility theory. Since decisions were made rapidly, the processing of attributes and their weights must have occurred fairly “automatically”. In spite of findings such as those of Brusovansky et al. (2018), our limited processing ability means we cannot readily use the strategy described by multi-attribute utility theory with more complex decision-making prob- lems. Instead, we often engage in satisficing (formed from the words satis- factory and sufficing). Satisficing involves “fast but ‘good-enough’ heuristic decision-making that prioritises some sources of information while ignor- ing others” (Oh et al., 2016, p. 1937). Schwartz et al. (2002) emphasised the importance of individual dif- ferences. They distinguished between satisficers (content with making rea- sonably good decisions) and maximisers (perfectionists). Satisficers were happier and more optimistic than maximisers and experienced less regret and self-blame. According to Cheek and Schwartz’s (2016) two-component model, maximisers differ from satisficers in setting higher goals (i.e., choose the best) and in strategy (seek out numerous options and compare them). In similar fashion, Luan and Li (2017) distinguished between goal desirability and feasibility (the effort required to achieve the goal). The main difference between maximisers and satisficers was that the former were willing to put more effort into achieving desirable goals.

Elimination by aspects Tversky (1972) argued that we often use relatively simple strategies. According to his elimination-by-aspects theory, decision-makers eliminate options by considering one relevant attribute or aspect after another. For example, someone buying a house may initially consider geographical loca- tion, eliminating all houses outside a given area. They may then consider the attribute of price, eliminating all properties costing above a certain figure. This process continues attribute by attribute until only one option remains. Elimination by aspects has the advantage that it is relatively unde- manding cognitively. However, the option selected often varies as a func- tion of the order in which the attributes are considered. As a result, the selected option may not be the best one. Kaplan et al. (2011) proposed a modified version of Tversky’s (1972) theory. In their two-stage theory, the initial stage resembles elimination in that only options fulfilling certain criteria are retained, which reduces the options being considered to a manageable number. The second stage involves detailed comparisons of the patterns of attributes of the retained options and is only feasible when the number of options is relatively small. Findings Payne (1976) asked students to decide among flats based on information about various attributes (e.g., rent; distance from campus). When there were many flats to consider, the students typically started with a simple strategy (e.g., satisficing; elimination-by-aspects). When only a few flats remained, they often switched to a more complex strategy corresponding to the assumptions of multi-attribute utility theory. Kaplan et al. (2011) obtained support for their two-stage theory. Student participants selected an apartment after having searched through informa- tion relating to 600 apartments. In the first stage, the three most popular criteria for retaining or eliminating apartments were location, walking time to the university and rental price. In the second stage, participants’ calcu- lations included complex interactions between attributes. For example, the importance attached to a low rental price depended on several other factors (e.g., price knowledge; frequency of going to the university; experience of searching for apartments). More specifically, low rent was most important when participants had little price knowledge, went frequently to the univer- sity and had often searched for apartments in recent years. Lenton and Stewart (2008) obtained similar findings when single women made selections from a real dating website with 4, 24 or 64 poten- tial dates. Unsurprisingly, the women shifted from complex to simple strat- egies with increased numbers of potential dates. The weighted averaging strategy assumed by multi-attribute utility theory was used by 81% with 4 potential dates but only 41% choosing from 64. The respective figures for the elimination-by-aspects strategy were 39% and 69%, respectively, and Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["sources; the term represents a blend of the words satisfactory and sufficing.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

Which attributes most influence date choice depends on how easily they are assessed. Speed-dating decisions at large events were determined mostly by easily assessable attributes (e.g., age; height; weight) rather than those harder to assess (e.g., occupation; academic achievements) (Lenton and Francesconi, 2010). The opposite was the case at small events. These findings probably reflect the increased cognitive load at large events. Evaluation Elimination-by-aspects theory has proved reasonably successful when indi- viduals choose among numerous options. However, individuals often adopt a more complex approach resembling that of multi-attribute utility theory with relatively few options. Thus, elimination by aspects is a useful filter at an early stage of decision-making but is less valuable subsequently. Elimination-by-aspects theory does not take account of our preference for options sharing many attributes with other options. Adding this prefer- ence to the elimination-by-aspects approach enhances its ability to predict people’s choices in decision making (Won, 2012). Complicating factors: changing preferences and selective exposure Most theories (including those discussed earlier) assume a given individual’s assessment of the utility or preference (desirability X importance) of any given attribute remains constant. Simon et al. (2004) tested this assump- tion. Participants decided between job offers from two department stores using four attributes (e.g., salary; commuting time). They were then told one job was in a much better location. This increased preferences for desir- able attributes of the chosen job and decreased preferences for undesirable attributes of that job. These findings are inconsistent with the notion that preferences remain constant. Decisions can even cause individuals to misremember factual informa- tion used during decision-making. Advanced nursing students prioritised a male or female patient for surgery. Afterwards, their memory for the facts (e.g., probability of surviving surgery) was distorted to increase the appar- ent support for their decision. It may seem changing preferences is irrational and likely to impair decision-making. However, changing preferences can be entirely rational if individuals’ initial preferences are based on uncertain or “noisy” observa- tions (Howes et al., 2016). This viewpoint is supported by the finding that preference changing is more common when time pressure decreases, suggest- ing preference changing is based on deliberate or analytic thinking. Most theories discussed earlier assumed decision-makers are pro- vided with all the information relevant to making a decision. However, an important factor in poor decision-making is selective exposure – the ten- dency to prefer information consistent with one’s beliefs over inconsistent information. Fischer and Greitemeyer (2010) proposed a model predicting increased selective exposure when individuals have high defence motivation KEY TERM Selective exposure A preference for information that strengthens pre-existing views and avoidance of information conflicting with those views.

Increased selective exposure should also be found when decision-makers have high accuracy motivation but restricted access to information. Reduced selec- tive exposure occurs when there is high accuracy motivation produced by instructing decision-makers to make the best choice. All these findings were reported in a meta-analysis (Hart et al., 2009). Naturalistic decision-making The artificiality of much laboratory research has led to an increasing inter- est in naturalistic decision-making. For example, in the laboratory, indi- viduals typically make decisions from a clear set of options. In contrast, real-life decision-making often occurs in relatively unstructured situations where individuals must generate their own options. Galotti (2002) proposed a theory of naturalistic decision-making in unstructured environments involving five phases: setting goals; gathering information; structuring the decision (i.e., listing options + criteria for deciding among them); making a final choice; and evaluating the decision. Phase order is flexible, with decision-makers often returning to previous phases when struggling to make a decision (see Figure 13.10). A key phase in Galotti’s theory is decision structuring. Galotti (2007) discussed five studies on important real-life decisions (e.g., students choos- ing a college; students choosing their main subject). There were several findings: (1) Decision-makers constrained the amount of information they consid- ered, focusing on between two and five options (mean = four) at any given time. Figure 13.9 A model of selective exposure. Defence motivation (a need to defend one’s own position) increases the individual’s selective exposure to confirmatory information. Accuracy motivation reduces selective exposure when it is triggered by the goal of making the optimal decision but increases it when it is triggered during the search for information.

(3) The number of attributes considered at any given time was between three and nine (mean = six). (4) The number of attributes did not decrease over time; sometimes it actually increased. (5) Individuals of higher ability and/or more education considered more attributes. (6) Most of the decisions were assessed as good. The most striking finding is that people con- sistently limited the amount of informa- tion (options + attributes) considered. This is consistent with Simon’s (1957) notion of bounded rationality but not multi- attribute utility theory. In addition, the number of options considered decreased by 18% over several months. A reduction (though larger than this) is predicted by Tversky’s (1972) elimination-by-aspects theory. Galotti and Tinkelenberg (2009) obtained similar findings to Galotti (2007). Parents choosing a first-grade school focused on a restricted number of options (typically 3 out of the 8+ available) and typically considered only about 5 criteria or attributes at any given time. However, their decision-making was dynamic – one-third of the options and over half the criteria changed on average over a six-month period. Expert decision-making We turn now to the processes involved in experts’ naturalistic decision- making focusing on Klein’s (e.g., 1998, 2008) recognition-primed decision-making model (see Figure 13.11). When the situation is familiar or typical, experts match the situation to learned patterns of information stored in long-term memory using pattern recognition. This rapid automatic process typically leads to retrieval of a single option. It is followed by mental simulation (i.e., imagining what would happen if the expert acted on the retrieved option). If the imagined outcome is satisfactory, that option rapidly determines his/her actions. There is much support for the model. Klein (1998) found in an anal- ysis of over 600 decisions that various kinds of experts (e.g., fireground commanders; military commanders) generally considered only one option at a time. Experts typically rapidly categorised even a novel situation as an example of a familiar type of situation. After that, they simply retrieved the appropriate decision from long-term memory. Klein et al. (2010) obtained further support for the model based on retrospective semi-structured interviews with fireground commanders.

There is an interpretive issue here. Did the fireground commanders consider only one option because it was objectively the best one (to the extent this can be calculated) or because there was insufficient time to consider other options? Another issue is that it is generally assumed fireground commanders make rapid decisions. However, as Launder and Perry (2014) pointed out, fireground commanders often obtain relevant information (e.g., from the initial radio contact) prior to arriving at the fire itself. There is general agreement that pattern recognition plays a key role in experts’ responses to a crisis situation. However, Launder and Perry (2014) argued the decision-making involved in urban fire settings is more complex than assumed within the model. More specifically, they identified five sequential stages: “Awareness of the situation, deciding on a strategy to handle the situation, planning how to implement the strategy, actually implementing the strategy, and reviewing how the emergency is and/or was handled” (p. 145). The existence of these five stages was supported by interviews with experienced firefighters. Individual differences are de-emphasised within the model. Consistent with the model, most individuals use an intuitive (or System 1) thinking style when making decisions in areas involving relevant expertise (Pachur & Spaar, 2015). However, Pachur and Spaar found some individuals pre- ferred a reflective (or System 2) thinking style even when they possessed relevant expertise. Evaluation The recognition-primed decision-making model explains experts’ ability to make rapid, accurate decisions under considerable pressure, often while Figure 13.11 Klein’s recognition-primed decision model. Decision-making is easy if the situation is typical: pattern recognition based on information in long-term memory generates a decision that confirms expectancies. Decision-making is more complex if the decision-maker’s expectancies are violated or if the situation is perceived as not typical. In either case, there is a process of clarifying and diagnosing the situation and collecting more data. From Patterson et al. (2009). British Computer Society.

The model’s empha- sis on their ability to use pattern recognition effectively is consistent with experts’ chess and medical decision-making (see Chapter 13). It also offers a potential explanation for slower, more deliberate decision-making in atypi- cal or unfamiliar situations. What are the model’s limitations? First, the model provides a general outline of expert decision-making but provides few details. For example, when a crisis situation is perceived as unfamiliar it is assumed experts engage in clarification and diagnosis. However, the precise information processing involved depends substantially on the nature of the crisis and the expert’s relevant knowledge. Second, the fact that most evidence has been obtained in real-life sit- uations is a mixed blessing. One problem is that the crisis situations inves- tigated were generally so complex it is hard to identify the key factors triggering experts’ decisions. In addition, there has (inevitably) been exten- sive reliance on experts’ fallible memories for their thought processes during crisis situations. Unconscious thought theory Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006) argued that unconscious thinking is often more effective than conscious thinking with complex decision- making. Conscious thinking is constrained by the limited capacity of conscious awareness, and so unconscious thinking is better than conscious thinking at integrating large amounts of information. Dijksterhuis and Strick (2016) updated this theory, arguing that unconscious thinking is most likely to be effective with inherently interesting problems. Findings Much research on unconscious thought theory has taken the following form: (1) Participants are presented with a problem providing several options; (2) Problem presentation is followed by a period of conscious delibera- tion or distraction (designed to prevent conscious thought about the problem); (3) Finally, participants select one option. Theoretically, the prediction is that decision-making performance will be superior for participants in the distraction condition (who have used only unconscious thought) than those in the conscious deliberation condition. Strick et al. (2011) reported significant support for this prediction in a meta-analysis. However, the magnitude of the effect depended on several factors (e.g., problem complexity; duration of distraction or deliberation). Nieuwenstein et al. (2015) also carried out a thorough meta-analysis based on more studies than those considered by Strick et al., and obtained weaker overall evidence for an unconscious thought advantage. Nordgren et al. (2011) argued complex decision-making should be best if it involved conscious and unconscious thought.

Evaluation Unconscious thought theory has focused attention on the strengths and lim- itations of conscious and unconscious thought. Unconscious thought some- times (but probably rarely) produces superior decision-making to conscious thought. The theory may have relevance to some cases where problem solving has benefited from incubation (putting a problem to one side for some time; see Chapter 12). Decision-making can be optimal when individ- uals combine conscious and unconscious thought (Nordgren et al., 2011). What are the theory’s limitations? First, the main problem is that the relevant findings are weak and inconsistent (Nieuwenstein et al., 2015). Second, participants assigned to the distraction condition are assumed to rely heavily on unconscious, intuitive processes in their decision- making. However, they often claim to rely on conscious memory (Aczel et al., 2011). CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. There are close links between judgement and decision-making. However, decision-making covers all processes involved in deciding on a course of action. In contrast, judgement focuses mainly on aspects of decision-making concerning with estimating the probability of various events. Judgements are evaluated in terms of their accuracy whereas decisions are evaluated on their consequences. • Judgement research. Our estimates of the probability of something happening change in the light of new evidence. When making such estimates, people often fail to take full account of base-rate information in part because of their reliance on the representativeness heuristic. Base-rate information is used more often when people are strongly motivated to use such information or when full causal knowledge is available. Some judgement errors depend on use of the availability heuristic. Errors based on use of the representativeness and availability heuristics occur in everyday life and are even found in experts. Medical misdiagnosis based on heuristics can be reduced by training in guided, structured, reflective processes. According to the natural frequency hypothesis, judgements are more accurate when based on natural sampling and frequencies rather than probabilities. In fact, the reasons for the superiority of frequency formats are varied and complex. • Theories of judgement. According to support theory, an event’s subjective probability increases as its description becomes Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["best if it involved conscious and unconscious thought.","Performance was optimal Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

However, the opposite finding has sometimes been obtained (e.g., when the problem focuses people’s attention on low-probability causes). Fast-and-frugal heuristics (e.g., the recognition and take-the-best heuristics) are clearly specified and are often useful. However, judgements often involve making use of more information sources than assumed by advocates of fast-and-frugal heuristics. According to Kahneman’s dual-process theory, initial intuitive processing (System 1) is sometimes followed by more conscious and controlled processing (System 2). This serial processing assumption is oversimplified as is the notion that the processes used on judgement tasks can be neatly divided into heuristic and controlled ones. • Decision-making under risk. According to prospect theory, people are more sensitive to potential losses than gains, and so are willing to take risks to avoid losses. The theory is supported by research on phenomena such as the framing and sunk-cost effects. There is also evidence of loss aversion in professional golfers, experienced poker players and financial experts. The theory has limited explanatory principles and the crucial notion of a “reference point” is often vague. There is sometimes less support for prospect theory when decisions are based on experience rather than descriptions. According to prospect theory, people should be risk averse for gains but risk seeking to avoid losses. However, many individuals are risk averse (or risk seeking) for both gains and losses. • Decision-making: emotional and social factors. A plausible prediction from prospect theory is that losses are experienced more intensely than gains. However, this is not the case when losses and gains are evaluated separately. Prospect theory is less applicable to affect-rich problems than affect-poor ones. The emotions of regret and fear often explain the existence of the omission and status quo biases. Brain areas of relevance to risky decision-making include the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. According to Tetlock’s social functionalist approach, people’s need to justify their decisions to others accounts for some biases in decision-making. This approach could be developed to explain cultural differences in loss aversion. • Applied and complex decision-making. Decision-makers in the laboratory and the real world often start by reducing the number of options considered by eliminating aspects, followed by detailed comparisons of the retained options. However, experts often consider a single option and make rapid intuitive decisions especially when there is considerable time pressure. Making a decision can cause decision-makers to misremember relevant factual information to increase the apparent support for that decision.

One is inductive reasoning, which involves drawing general conclusions from premises (statements) referring to particular instances. A key feature of inductive reasoning is that the conclusions of inductively valid arguments are probably (but not necessarily) true. The philosopher Bertrand Russell provided the following example. A turkey might use inductive reasoning to draw the conclusion “Each day I am fed”, because that has always been the case in the past. However, there is no certainty that the turkey will be fed tomorrow. Indeed, if tomorrow is Christmas Eve, it is likely to be proven false. Scientists very often use inductive reasoning similarly to Russell’s hypothetical turkey. A psychologist may find across numerous experiments that reinforcement (reward) is needed for learning. This might lead them to use inductive reasoning to propose the hypothesis that reinforcement is essential for learning. This conclusion is not necessarily true because future experiments may not replicate past ones. The other kind of reasoning identified by philosophers is deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning allows us to draw conclusions that are definitely or certainly valid provided other statements are assumed to be true. For example, the conclusion Tom is taller than Harry is necessarily true if we assume Tom is taller than Dick and Dick is taller than Harry. Deductive-reasoning problems owe their origins to formal logic. An important issue is whether the distinction between inductive and deductive reasoning is as clear-cut in practice as it appears above. There is increasing evidence that similar processes are involved in both cases. For example, Stephens et al. (2018) asked participants to evaluate identical sets of arguments after receiving inductive- or deductive-reasoning instructions. With the former instructions, participants decided whether the conclusion was plausible, strong or likely to be true. With the latter instructions, they decided whether the conclusion was necessarily true.

(2018) found participants used the same processes whether instructed to reason inductively or deductively. The only major difference was that greater argument strength was required to decide that a conclusion was necessarily true (deductive condition) than to decide it was strong or likely to be true. The wide chasm between the artificial, logic-driven, deductive- reasoning tasks traditionally used in the laboratory and everyday reasoning in the form of argumentation has led to a rapid increase in research on informal reasoning. Informal reasoning (discussed later, pp. 694–701) is based on our knowledge and experience rather than logic. It is a form of inductive reasoning that resembles our everyday reasoning. A major consequence of this shift in research is that it is increasingly accepted that reasoning processes often resemble those used in judgement and decision-making. For example, the Bayesian approach, according to which our subjective probabilities (i.e., that X is dishonest) are adjusted in the light of new information, plays a prominent role in theorising about judgements (see Chapter 13). In a similar fashion, the Bayesian approach is increasingly applied to reasoning (Navarrete and Mandel, 2016). HYPOTHESIS TESTING Karl Popper (1968) distinguished between confirmation and falsifica- tion. Confirmation involves the attempt to obtain evidence confirming or supporting one’s hypothesis. In contrast, falsification involves the attempt to falsify hypotheses by experimental tests. Popper claimed we cannot achieve confirmation via hypothesis testing. Even if all the avail- able evidence supports a hypothesis, future evidence may disprove it. He argued falsifiability (the potential for falsification) separates scien- tific from unscientific activities such as religion or pseudo-science (e.g., psychoanalysis). According to Popper, scientists should focus on falsification. In fact, as discussed later, they often seek confirmatory rather than disconfirmatory evidence when testing their hypotheses. It has also been claimed the same excessive focus on confirmatory evidence is found in laboratory studies on hypothesis testing – research to which we now turn. Wason’s 2-4-6 task Wason (1960) devised a much-researched hypothesis-testing task (see Evans, 2016, for a review). Participants were told three numbers 2-4-6 con- formed to a simple relational rule. Their task was to generate sets of three numbers and provide reasons for generating each set. After each choice, the experimenter indicated whether the set of numbers conformed to the experimenter’s rule. Here is the rule: “Three numbers in ascending order of magnitude.” The participants could announce what they believed to be the rule on any trial and were told whether it was correct. The rule sounds (very) simple. However, only 21% of university stu- dents were correct with their first attempt (Wason, 1960). In spite of the emphasis in the literature on the poor levels of performance with the 2-4-6 task, Wason found 72% of participants eventually solved it.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n668 Thinking and reasoning Why is performance so poor? One explanation focuses on confirma- tion bias – most people seek information confirming their hypothesis. For example, participants whose original hypothesis or rule is that the second number is twice the first, and the third number is three times the first number often generate sets of numbers (test triples) consistent with that hypothesis (e.g., 6-12-18; 50-100-150). Wason assumed participants produced test triples conforming to their current hypothesis. However, this is an oversimplification (Evans, 2016). It is true that participants mostly produce positive or confirmatory tests conforming to their hypothesis and expected to receive positive feedback (conforms to the rule). However, participants sometimes produce negative tests, not con- forming to their hypothesis, where they expect to receive negative feed- back (does not conform to the rule). There are two types of negative tests (Evans, 2016): (1) those (e.g., 12-8-4) where participants expect to receive the answer “No” and which are therefore confirmatory; (2) those (e.g., 1-4-9) where participants expect to receive the answer “Yes” and which are therefore disconfirmatory. Findings Participants typically engage in very few falsification attempts on the 2-4-6 task and have a low success rate. Tweney et al. (1980) enhanced perfor- mance by telling participants the experimenter had two rules in mind and they had to identify both. One rule generated DAX triples and the other MED triples. They were also told 2-4-6 was a DAX triple. After generating each test triple, participants were informed whether the set fitted the DAX or MED rule. The DAX rule was any three numbers in ascending order and the MED rule covered all other sets of numbers. Over 50% of participants produced the correct answer on their first attempt (much higher than with the standard problem). Of importance, participants could identify the DAX rule by using positive testing to confirm the MED rule, and so they did not have to try to disconfirm the DAX rule. Gale and Ball (2012) carried out a study resembling that of Tweney et al. (1980). They always used 2-4-6 as an example of a DAX triple, but the example of a MED triple was 6-4-2 or 4-4-4. Success in identify- ing the DAX rule was much greater when the MED example was 6-4-2 (75%) rather than 4-4-4 (23%). The greatest difference between solvers and non-solvers of the DAX rule was the number of descending triples they produced. This indicates the importance of participants focusing on the ascending/descending dimension, which was difficult to do when the MED example was 4-4-4. Cowley and Byrne (2005) argued people show confirmation bias because they are loath to abandon their initial hypothesis. They suggested people might be much better at managing to falsify a given incorrect hypothesis if told it was someone else’s. As predicted, 62% of participants abandoned the other person’s hypothesis compared to only 25% who abandoned their KEY TERM Confirmation bias In hypothesis testing, seeking evidence that supports one’s beliefs.

Participants were told the hypothesis “even numbers ascending in two” was theirs or that of an imaginary participant Peter. They generated more negative falsifying tests when the hypothesis was Peter’s rather than their own (32% vs 7%, respectively). In another experiment by Cowley (2015), all participants were told Peter’s hypothesis was “even numbers ascending in twos”. In two condi- tions, they were also told another participant, James, had a different explicit hypothesis (“any ascending numbers”) or implicit hypothesis (“something else”). In the third, condition, there was no mention of James. There were three key findings. First, there were numerous falsifying test triples (posi- tive + negative tests) in all conditions (percentages between 43% and 54%; predominantly negative falsifying tests). Second, Peter’s incorrect hypoth- esis was rejected by nearly 80% of participants. Third, the correct rule was discovered by 50% of participants given James’ explicit hypothesis and 31% given his implicit hypothesis. In sum, “Negative falsifying is possible more often than the literature has ever shown . . . falsification is sufficient to announce that a hypothesis is untrue, but an explicit alternative hypothesis that explains the falsifying result is necessary for truth discovery” (Cowley, 2015, pp. 32–33). Performance on the 2-4-6 task involves separable processes of hypoth- esis generation and hypothesis testing. Most research has focused on the latter, but Cherubini et al. (2005) focused on hypothesis generation. They argued participants try to preserve as much of the information contained in the example triple (i.e., 2-4-6) as possible in their initial hypothesis, making this hypothesis much more specific than the general rule. Cherubini et al. (2005) presented participants with two initial triples exemplifying the rule. When these triples inhibited the generation of a very specific rule (e.g., 6-8-10; 9-14-15), participants generated more general hypotheses than when the two triples were consistent with a specific rule (e.g., 6-8-10; 16-18-20). The success rate was much higher in the former condition (70% vs 30%). Theoretical analysis Most hypotheses are sparse or narrow (applying to under half the possi- ble entities in any given domain: Navarro & Perfors, 2011). For example, Perfors and Navarro (2009) asked people to generate all the rules and hypotheses applying to numbers in a given domain (numbers 1 to 1,000). The key finding was that 83% of the rules (e.g., two-digit numbers; prime numbers) applied to fewer than 20% of the numbers. With sparse hypotheses, positive testing is optimal “because there are so many ways to be wrong and so few to be right”. In such circum- stances, the learner will discover “the world has a bias towards saying ‘no’, and asking for ‘yes’ is the best way to overcome it” (Perfors & Navarro, 2009, p. 2746). Thus, positive testing is typically successful. In contrast, the 2-4-6 task penalises positive testing because the target rule is so general.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n670 Thinking and reasoning Evaluation Wason’s 2-4-6 task has been “the classic test-bed reasoning task for investi- gations of hypothesis falsification for over forty years” (Cowley, 2015, p. 2), with research having clarified the strengths and limitations of human induc- tive reasoning. The processes involved in the 2-4-6 task are of relevance to understanding scientists’ hypothesis testing. What are the limitations of Wason’s approach? First, his task differs from real-life hypothesis testing. Participants given the 2-4-6 task receive immediate accurate feedback but are not told why the numbers they pro- duced attracted a “yes” or “no” response. In the real world (e.g., scientists testing hypotheses), the feedback is much more informative, but is often delayed in time and sometimes inaccurate. Second, the correct rule or hypothesis in the 2-4-6 task (three numbers in ascending order of magnitude) is very general because it applies to a fairly high proportion of sets of three numbers. In contrast, most rules or hypotheses apply to only a smallish proportion of possible objects or events. Positive testing works poorly on the 2-4-6 task but not with most other forms of hypothesis testing. Third, Wason argued most people show confirmation bias and find a falsification approach very hard to use. However, there is much less con- firmation bias but more evidence of falsification when testing someone else’s hypothesis (Cowley, 2015; Cowley & Byrne, 2005). This is consistent with scientists’ behaviour. For example, at a conference in 1977 on the levels-of-processing approach to memory (see Chapter 6), nearly all the research presented identified limitations with that approach. Hypothesis testing: simulated and real research environments According to Popper (1968), a crucial feature of all truly scientific theories is falsifiability. Scientists should focus on falsification rather than confir- mation because the latter cannot be achieved. His arguments possess merit but are oversimplified (see below). Suppose a scientist obtains findings apparently inconsistent with their hypothesis. The findings may mean the hypothesis is incorrect. However, they may reflect problems with the exper- imental design or the accuracy of the data. Of relevance, a recent study (Open Science Collaboration, 2015; see Chapter 1) found that attempts to replicate 100 findings in psychology were successful only 36% of the time. Dunbar (1993) found evidence of confirmation bias using a simulated research environment. Participants had to explain how genes are controlled by other genes using a computer-based molecular genetics laboratory. This problem is so difficult that those solving it in real life (Jacques Monod and François Jacob) received the Nobel prize! The participants were led to focus on the hypothesis that the gene control was by activation whereas it was actually by inhibition. Participants who simply sought data consistent with their activation hypothesis failed to solve the problem. In contrast, the 20% of partici- pants solving the problem tried to explain the discrepant findings. Most participants started with the general hypothesis that activation was the key Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["e 2-4-6 task penalises positive testing because the target rule is so general.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

Only after every activation hypothesis had been disconfirmed did some participants focus on explaining data inconsistent with activation hypotheses. Confirmation bias: analysis and interpretation We have seen scientists generally adopt a confirmatory approach during hypothesis testing. We now focus on confirmation bias when scientists analyse and interpret their findings (see Nuzzo, 2015, for a review). Fugelsang et al. (2004) studied professional scientists working on issues in molecular biology relating to how genes control and promote replication IN THE REAL WORLD: HYPOTHESIS TESTING BY SCIENTISTS What actually happens in real-life science? Uchino et al. (2010) analysed numerous research articles in psychology. The great majority (77%) sought confirmation by testing the hypothesis favoured by the researcher(s) and 91% supported an existing theory. Only 22% discussed other hypoth- eses. These findings suggest, “Someone must be wrong: either scientists are going about their business incorrectly or Popper was mistaken about how science progresses” (Sanbonmatsu et al., 2015, p. 2). Sanbonmatsu et al. (2015) proposed a solution based on a distinction between absolute or uni- versal hypotheses and non-absolute hypotheses. Absolute hypotheses claim a given phenomenon always occurs, whereas non-absolute hypotheses claim a phenomenon occurs only in some condi- tions. Popper (1968) assumed scientific theories are absolute or universal. On that assumption, the optimal approach involves falsification or disconfirmation – a single negative observation would disprove an absolute theory. In contrast, a confirmatory approach is generally more informative than a disconfirmatory one with non-absolute hypotheses. What do scientists actually do? Sanbonmatsu et al. (2015) found 96% of researchers in psychol- ogy indicated their research was mostly driven by non-absolute hypotheses. Nearly all (96%) said they generally used a confirmatory approach. With absolute hypotheses, 81% of researchers would use a disconfirmatory approach. With non-absolute hypotheses, in contrast, only 9% would use a disconfirmatory approach with 91% favouring a confirmatory approach. Feist (2008) argued a useful heuristic in science is “confirm early – disconfirm late”. Scientists should initially seek confirmatory evidence for a theory; when they have such evidence, they should focus more on disconfirming the theory and discovering its breadth of application. Eighty-three percent of scientists were most likely to use a confirmatory approach early in a research pro- gramme, and 87% were most likely to use a disconfirmatory approach subsequently (Sanbonmatsu et al., 2015). In sum, Popper adopted an excessively black-and-white approach. The reality is messy: research rarely provides a definitive falsification of a theory. Instead, theories are modified as their limita- tions become increasingly apparent (Lakatos, 1978). Scientists’ strategies when engaged in hypothesis testing approximate to maximising the infor- mativeness of the evidence obtained. Thus, describing their typical approach as “confirmation bias” (see Glossary) is misleading. Kane and Webster (2013) suggested using the term “confirma- tion heuristic” to refer to appropriate focus on a confirmation strategy, limiting the use of “con- firmation bias” to situations where scientists refuse to use the disconfirmatory strategy even when optimal.

Of 417 experimental results, over half (223) were inconsistent with the scientists’ predictions. They responded to 88% of these inconsistent findings by blaming problems with their methods. In only 12% of cases did the scientists modify their theories. Thus, the sci- entists showed considerable reluctance to change their original theoretical position. Approximately two-thirds of the inconsistent findings were followed up, generally by changing the methods used. In 55% of cases, the incon- sistent findings were replicated. The scientists’ reactions were very different this time – in 61% of cases, they changed their theoretical assumptions. How defensible was the scientists’ behaviour? Note that almost half the inconsistent findings were not replicated when a second study was carried out. Thus, it was reasonable for the scientists to avoid prematurely accept- ing possibly spurious findings. Overall, these findings suggest the scientists’ exhibited only a modest tendency towards confirmation bias. John et al. (2012) asked over 2,000 psychologists to provide anony- mous information about their questionable research practices. There was substantial evidence of such practices. For example, John et al. estimated 78% of respondents had selectively reported studies that “worked”, 62% had excluded data (typically those inconsistent with their hypotheses), and 36% had stopped data collection after achieving the desired result. Here are two other examples of confirmation bias. First, Bakker and Wicherts (2011) found in an analysis of statistical analyses in research jour- nals that over 10% of p values were incorrect. In the great majority of cases where such errors changed the statistical significance of the results, the change was from non-significant to significant. Second, researchers often expect their meta-analyses (see Glossary) to support their existing hypotheses. As Watt and Kennedy (2017, p. 1) argued, “Decisions about studies to be included [in a meta-analysis], statis- tical analyses, and moderating factors are made after the analysts know the outcomes of the studies. These retrospective decisions provide high poten- tial for [confirmation] bias.” How can we reduce confirmation bias in the analysis and interpretation of data? Several answers have been proposed (Hamlin, 2017). First, more openness or transparency is required by experimenters so other research- ers can see precisely what has been done. Second, there is blind analysis – all relevant statistical analyses are completed before the experimenter(s) is aware of the outcomes of such analyses. Third, and most importantly, there is pre-registration – experimenters announce the rationale, hypoth- eses, design and proposed methods of data analysis before conducting a piece of research. DEDUCTIVE REASONING In deductive reasoning, conclusions can be drawn with certainty. In this section, we will mostly consider conditional and syllogistic reasoning prob- lems based on traditional logic. In the next section, we consider general theories of deductive reasoning. As we will see, theory and research increas- ingly focus on the non-logical strategies and processes used when people solve deductive-reasoning problems.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nReasoning and hypothesis testing 673 Conditional reasoning Conditional reasoning (basically, reasoning with “if”) had its origins in propositional logic, in which logical operators such as or, and, if . . . then, if and only if are included in sentences or propositions. In this system, symbols represent sentences and logical operators are applied to them to reach con- clusions. Thus, we might use P to stand for the proposition “It is raining” and Q to stand for “Nancy gets wet”, and then use the logical operator if . . . then to relate these two propositions: if P then Q. The meanings of words and propositions in propositional logic differ from their natural language meanings. For example, propositions can have only one of two truth values: true or false. If P stands for “It is raining”, then P is true (in which case it is raining) or P is false (it is not raining). Propositional logic does not admit any uncertainty about the truth of P, such as when it is so misty you could almost call it raining. Many people produce incorrect answers when given certain condi- tional-reasoning problems. Consider the following (affirmation of the consequent): Premises If Nancy is angry, then I am upset. I am upset. Conclusion Therefore, Nancy is angry. Many people accept the above conclusion as valid. However, it is not valid because I may be upset for some other reason (e.g., my football team has lost). Here is another problem in conditional reasoning: Premises If it is raining, then Nancy gets wet. It is raining. Conclusion Nancy gets wet. This conclusion is valid. It illustrates the rule of inference known as modus ponens: “If P, then Q” and also given “P”, we can validly infer Q. Another major rule of inference is modus tollens: from the premise “If P, then Q” and the premise “Q is false”, the conclusion “P is false” neces- sarily follows. Here is an example: Premises If it is raining, then Nancy gets wet. Nancy does not get wet. Conclusion It is not raining.

Another inference involves denial of the antecedent: Premises If it is raining, then Nancy gets wet. It is not raining. Conclusion Therefore, Nancy does not get wet. Many people argue the above conclusion is valid although it is invalid. It does not have to be raining for Nancy to get wet (e.g., she might have jumped into a swimming pool). Traditionally, research on conditional reasoning was limited in three ways. First, unlike everyday life, it focused on disinterested reasoning (goals and preferences are irrelevant). For example, denial of the anteced- ent is invalid in traditional logic. In natural language, however, “If P, then Q” often means “If and only if P, then Q”. If someone says to you “If you mow the lawn, I will give you five dollars”, you are likely to interpret it to imply, “If you don’t mow the lawn, I won’t give you five dollars.” Second, traditional research typically involved instructions indicat- ing that background knowledge was irrelevant. Nowadays, participants are generally not instructed to disregard their relevant knowledge with conditional-reasoning problems. Third, traditional research required participants to draw definite con- clusions (true or false). In contrast, participants nowadays are often asked to assess the probability of the conclusion being true. This change is desir- able because we often assign probabilities to conclusions in everyday life (Singmann et al., 2016). Theories Here we briefly discuss theories of conditional reasoning. More general theories of deductive reasoning are discussed later. Klauer et al. (2010) proposed a dual-source model of conditional reasoning. There is a knowledge-based process influenced by premise content where the subjec- tive probability of the conclusion depends on individuals’ relevant know- ledge. There is also a form-based process influenced only by the form of the premises. Verschueren et al. (2005) also proposed a dual-process model (other more general dual-process models are discussed later, pp. 683–690). They focused on individual differences in conditional reasoning more than Klauer et al. (2010). Some reasoners use a relatively complex counter- example strategy: a conclusion is considered invalid if the reasoner can find a counterexample to it (this process is discussed later in the section on mental models, pp. 681–683). The other process is an intuitive statistical strategy based on probabilistic reasoning triggered by relevant knowledge. Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["sed on if .","."]}

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nReasoning and hypothesis testing 675 Findings Singmann et al. (2016) tested the dual-source model using many condition- al-reasoning problems. For each problem, participants rated the likelihood of the conclusion being true on a probability scale running from 0% to 100%. Knowledge-based processes were more important than form-based ones. Overall, the model accounted very well for participants’ performance. De Neys et al. (2005) obtained evidence relevant to Verschueren et al.’s (2005) dual-process model. On some trials, participants were pre- sented with few or many counterexamples conflicting with valid conclu- sions (modus ponens and modus tollens). According to classical logic, these counterexamples should have been ignored. In fact, however, participants were more likely to decide wrongly the conclusions were invalid when there were many counterexamples. Markovits et al. (2013) tested the dual-process model using problems involving affirmation of the consequent (where the conclusion is invalid). Here are two examples: (1) If a rock is thrown at a window, then the window will break. A window is broken. Therefore, a rock was thrown at the window. (2) If a finger is cut, then it will bleed. A finger is bleeding. Therefore, the finger was cut. Reasoners using the statistical strategy were influenced by the fact that the subjective probability that “If a finger is bleeding, it was cut” is greater than the probability that “If a window is broken, it was broken by a rock”. As a result, such reasoners accepted the invalid conclusion more often in problem (2) than (1). In contrast, reasoners using the counterexample strategy accepted the conclusion if no counterexample came to mind. They also accepted the invalid conclusion more often in problem (2). This was because it was easier to find counterexamples with respect to the conclusion of problem (1) (the window might have been broken by several objects other than a rock) than the conclusion of problem (2). According to the model, the counterexample strategy is more cogni- tively demanding than the statistical strategy. Accordingly, Markovits et al. (2013) predicted it would be used less often when participants had limited time. This prediction was supported: that strategy was used on 49% of trials with unlimited time but only 1.7% of trials with limited time. Markovits et al. (2017) gave their participants modus ponens inferences which are always valid. Each problem was presented with additional infor- mation indicating the relative strength of evidence supporting the inference (50%; 75%; 99%; or 100%). Markovits et al. compared groups of partici- pants previously identified as using counterexample or statistical strategies. Markovits et al. (2017) found clear differences between the two groups (see Figure 14.1). Statistical reasoners were strongly influenced by relative strength when deciding whether to accept modus ponens inferences. In con- trast, counterexample reasoners showed a sharp reduction in acceptance when some evidence failed to support the inference (e.g., the 99% and 75% conditions). These findings were as predicted.

For example, reasoners are encouraged to use their relevant knowledge on rea- soning tasks. They also assign probabilities to the correctness of conclu- sions rather than simply deciding conclusions are valid or invalid. Theoretically, it is assumed reasoners are influenced by the form of the premises. More importantly, however, their relevant knowledge and expe- rience lead them to engage in probabilistic reasoning (dual-source model) or to try to find counterexamples to the stated conclusion (dual-process model). Wason selection task The Wason selection task has been studied intensively by researchers inter- ested in deductive reasoning. However, it is more accurately described as a task involving hypothesis testing using a conditional rule. In the standard version of the task, four cards lie on a table (R, G, 2, 7; see Figure 14.2). Each card has a letter on one side and a number on the other, and there is a rule applying to the four cards (e.g., “If there is an R on one side of the card, then there is a 2 on the other side of the card”). The participants’ task is to select only those cards needing to be turned over to decide whether or not the rule is correct. What is your solution? Most people select the R and 2 cards. If you did the same, you are wrong! You need to see whether any cards fail to obey the rule when turned over. From this perspective, the 2 card is irrelevant: if there is an R on the other side, this indicates only that the rule might be correct.

The correct answer is to select the R and 7 cards, an answer given by only about 10% of university students. The 7 is necessary because it would definitely disprove the rule if it had an R on the other side. How can we explain performance on the Wason selection task? Several factors are involved. First, performance is worse with abstract versions of the task (as above) compared to concrete versions referring to everyday events (e.g., “Every time I travel to Manchester, I travel by train”). Ragni et al. (2018) found in a meta-analysis that the percentage of correct answers increased from 7% with abstract versions to 21% with concrete versions. Second, there is matching bias (the tendency to select cards matching the items named in the rule). Thompson et al. (2013a) obtained strong evi- dence for matching bias on the selection task. In addition, cards named in the rule were selected faster than other cards and produced greater feelings of rightness. Third, the logical solution to the Wason selection task conflicts with everyday life (Oaksford, 1997). According to formal logic, we should test the rule “All swans are white” by searching for swans and non-white birds. However, this would be extremely time-consuming because only a few birds are swans and the overwhelming majority of birds are non-white. It would be preferable to adopt a probabilistic approach based on the likely probabilities of different kinds of events or objects. The problem of testing the above rule resembles the Wason selection task, which has the form “If p, then q”. We should choose q cards (e.g., 2) when the expected probability of q is low but not-q cards when q’s expected probability is high to maximise information gain. As predicted, far more q cards were selected when the percentage of q cards was low (17%) than when it was high (83%) (Oaksford et al., 1997). Fourth, motivation is important. People are more likely to select the potentially falsifying card (7 in the original version of the task) if moti- vated to disprove the rule. Dawson et al. (2002) gave some participants the rule that individuals high in emotionality lability experience an early death. The four cards showed high emotional lability, low emotional lability, early death and late death, with the correct answer involving selecting the first and last cards. Of participants led to believe they had high emotional lability (and so motivated to disprove the rule), 38% solved the problem (versus 9% of control participants). Motivation is also involved with deontic rules (rules concerned with obligation or permission). Sperber and Girotto (2002) used a deontic rule relating to cheating. Paolo must decide whether he is being cheated when buying things through the internet: the answer is to select the “item paid for” and “item not received” cards (selected by 68% of participants). This unusually high level of performance was achieved because the motiva- tion to detect cheating led participants to select the “item not received” card. In a meta-analysis, Ragni et al. (2018) found the correct answer was selected by 61% of participants with deontic versions but 7% using abstract versions. Marrero et al. (2016) proposed a general motivational approach accounting for the above findings.

Fifth, Ragni et al. (2018) evaluated 15 theories of relevance to Wason’s selection task. In a large-scale meta-analysis, they found Johnson-Laird’s (1983) mental model theory (discussed shortly, pp. 681–683) best predicted performance. In essence, this theory assumes that selections on Wason’s selection task depend on two processes: (1) There is an intuitive process producing selections matching the rea- soners’ hypothesis (e.g., selection of R in the version of the task shown in Figure 14.2). (2) There is a more deliberate process producing selections of potential counterexamples to the hypothesis (e.g., selection of 7 in the same version). The extent to which reasoners search for counterexamples depends on factors discussed above including task content, instructions and so on. Syllogistic reasoning Syllogistic reasoning has been studied for over 2,000 years. A syllogism consists of two premises or statements followed by a conclusion. Here is an example: “All A are B; all B are C. Therefore, all A are C”. A syllogism contains three items (A, B and C), with one (B) occurring in both premises. The premises and conclusion all contain one of the following quantifiers: all; some; no; and some . . . not. When presented with a syllogism, you must decide whether the conclu- sion is valid assuming the premises are valid. The validity (or otherwise) of the conclusion depends only on whether it follows logically from the premises – the conclusion’s truth or falsity in the real world is irrelevant. Consider the following example: Premises All children are obedient. All girl guides are children. Conclusion Therefore, all girl guides are obedient. The conclusion follows logically from the premises. Thus, it is valid regard- less of your views about children’s obedience. Findings Various biases cause errors in syllogistic reasoning. Of special impor- tance is belief bias, the tendency to accept invalid conclusions as valid if believable and to reject valid (but unbelievable) conclusions as invalid (theoretical explanations are discussed later). Klauer et al. (2000) investi- gated belief bias thoroughly. The conclusions of half their syllogisms were believable (e.g., “Some fish are not trout”) whereas the others were unbe- lievable (e.g., “Some trout are not fish”). Half the syllogisms were valid KEY TERMS Syllogism A type of problem used in deductive reasoning; there are two statements or premises and a conclusion that may or may not follow logically from the premises.

What did Klauer et al. (2000) find? First, there was a base-rate effect: syllogistic rea- soning performance was influenced by the perceived probability of syllogisms being valid (see Figure 14.3). Second, there was strong evidence for belief bias. Third, there was a belief-by-logic interaction. Performance on syllogisms with valid conclusions was better when those conclusions were believ- able, whereas performance on syllogisms with invalid conclusions was worse when those conclusions were believable. In sum, reason- ers’ performance was influenced by factors irrelevant to logic. Stupple and Ball (2008) found with syl- logistic reasoning that unbelievable premises were processed more slowly than believable ones. This finding suggests people experi- enced conflict between their beliefs and what they were asked to assume and resolving this conflict was time-consuming. Some problems in syllogistic reasoning occur because of differences in the meanings of expressions in formal logic and everyday life. For example, we often assume “All As are Bs” means “All Bs are As” and “Some As are not Bs” means “Some Bs are not As”. Ceraso and Provitera (1971) spelled out such premises unambiguously (e.g., “All As are Bs, but some Bs are not As”). This greatly enhanced reasoning performance. In similar fashion, “some” means “some but not all” in everyday usage but “at least one and possibly all” in formal logic. Schmidt and Thompson (2008) found syllogistic reasoning improved when the meaning of “some” in formal logic was made explicit. Finally, people’s syllogistic reasoning per- formance is influenced by whether the con- clusion matches the premises in surface or superficial features. Here is an example of matching: no A are not B; no B are not C; therefore, no C are not A; and an example of non-matching: all A are B; all B are C; therefore no A are not C. In spite of the irrelevance of matching vs non-matching to formal logic, people are more likely to accept conclusions matching the premises (Stupple et al., 2013).

However, such reasoning is also very common in everyday life. Here are a few examples starting with the politician’s syllogism, which is along the following lines: Premises We must do something to save the country. Our policy is something. Conclusion Our policy will save the country. Invalid conditional reasoning occurs frequently in everyday life. Earlier we discussed the logical fallacy known as denial of the antecedent. Here is a real-world example: Premises If you have got nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. You have nothing to hide. Conclusion You have nothing to fear. The above argument is invalid because it implies that people are only interested in privacy because they have something to hide. In fact, of course, we all have a basic human right to privacy. Ironically, the authorities who argue strongly in favour of greater surveillance of the public are often notoriously reluctant to provide information about their own activities! Finally, we consider an everyday example of the logical fallacy known as affirmation of the con- sequent (discussed earlier, p. 673). Premises If the Earth’s climate altered throughout pre-human history, this was due to natural climate change. The Earth’s climate is currently altering. Conclusion Natural climate change is occurring currently. This is clearly an invalid argument. The fact that past climate change was not due to humans does not necessarily mean that current climate change is not due to human intervention. In sum, many groups in society (e.g. politicians; climate change deniers) are strongly motivated to persuade us of the rightness of their beliefs. This often leads them to engage in invalid forms of reasoning. The take-home message is that we all need to be sceptical and vigilant when exposed to their arguments. THEORIES OF “DEDUCTIVE” REASONING Here we will focus on two very influential theoretical approaches to deductive reasoning. First, there is Johnson-Laird’s mental model theory, which represents a relatively “traditional” approach.

Second, we turn our Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nReasoning and hypothesis testing 681 attention to the increasingly popular dual-process approach. The word deductive in the title of this section has been put in quotation marks to indi- cate that individuals presented with deductive-reasoning problems often fail to use deductive processes when trying to solve them. Mental models Johnson-Laird (e.g., 1983; Johnson-Laird et al., 2018) argues that reasoning involves constructing mental models. What is a mental model? According to Johnson-Laird et al. (2015, p. 202), a mental model is “an iconic rep- resentation of a possibility that depicts only those clauses in a compound assertion that are true. The mental models of a disjunction, ‘A or B but not both’ accordingly represent two possibilities: possibly (A) and possibly (B)”. It is iconic because its structure corresponds to what it represents. Here is a concrete example of a mental model: Premises The lamp is on the right of the pad. The book is on the left of the pad. The clock is in front of the book. The vase is in front of the lamp. Conclusion The clock is to the left of the vase. According to Johnson-Laird (1983), people use the information contained in the premises to construct a mental model like this: book pad lamp clock vase The conclusion the clock is to the left of the vase clearly follows from the mental model. The fact we cannot construct a mental model consistent with the premises (but inconsistent with the conclusions) (i.e., we cannot construct a counterexample) indicates the model is valid. Here are the theory’s main assumptions: ● A mental model describing the given situation is constructed and the conclusions that follow are generated. ● An attempt is made to construct alternative models to falsify the conclu- sion by finding counterexamples to the conclusion. If a counterexample model is not found, the conclusion is deemed valid. ● The construction of mental models involves the limited resources of working memory (see Chapter 6). ● Reasoning problems requiring the construction of several mental models are harder than those requiring only one mental model because the former impose greater demands on working memory. ● The principle of truth: “Mental models represent what is true, but not what is false” (Khemlani & Johnson-Laird, 2017, p. 16). This mini- mises demands on working memory. KEY TERMS Mental models An internal representation of some possible situation or event in the world having the same structure as that situation or event. Principle of truth The notion that assertions are represented by forming mental models concerning what is true while ignoring what is false.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n682 Thinking and reasoning Findings Several studies support the notion that working memory plays a central role in the formation of mental models. Brunyé et al. (2008) found the central executive (see Glossary) and visuo-spatial sketchpad (see Glossary) components of the working memory system were heavily involved in con- structing mental models. Copeland and Radvansky (2004) found working memory capacity (see Glossary) correlated +.42 with syllogistic reasoning performance. Khemlani and Johnson-Laird (2017) reviewed 20 studies testing the principle of truth. These studies used various reasoning tasks, in all of which individuals failing to represent what is false in their mental models would produce illusory inferences. Numerous illusory inferences were drawn. In contrast, performance was very good with similar problems where adher- ence to the principle of truth was sufficient to produce the correct answer. Consider the following problem: Only one of the following premises is true about a particular hand of cards: There is a king in the hand or there is an ace, or both. There is a queen in the hand or there is an ace, or both. There is a jack in the hand or there is a 10, or both. Is it possible there is an ace in the hand? What is your answer? Nearly everyone says “Yes”, but this is wrong! If there were an ace in the hand, both the first two premises would be true. However, the problem states that only one of the premises is true. Theoretically, individuals make illusory inferences because they ignore what is false. As predicted, people are less susceptible to such inferences if explicitly instructed to falsify the premises of reasoning problems (Newsome & Johnson-Laird, 2006). Khemlani and Johnson-Laird (2012) carried out a meta-analysis of syllogistic reasoning studies to compare seven theories. The mental model theory was best at predicting participants’ responses with a 95% success rate. However, it was relatively weak at rejecting responses people do not produce. According to the theory, people search for counterexamples after having constructed their initial mental model and generated a conclu- sion. As a result, they may construct several mental models and con- sider several conclusions. Newstead et al. (1999) obtained no support for this conclusion: the average number of conclusions considered with multiple- and single-model syllogisms was very low (1.12. and 1.05, respectively). Khemlani et al. (2012) also found that people generate relatively few counterexamples. Participants were given this problem: They’re not living adult males. So, who could they be? There are seven possibilities (e.g., dead adult males; living girls) but participants listed only four possibilities on average. The theory struggles with ambiguous reasoning problems.

The Beetle is to the left of the Porsche. The Dodge is in front of the Beetle. The Volvo is in front of the Porsche. There is no definite answer to the question “Which relation holds between the Beetle and the Ferrari?”. Mental model theory does not predict which answer will be given by most participants. Ragni and Knauff (2013) argued that reasoners prefer easily constructed mental models (e.g., the Beetle is to the left of the Ferrari in the above problem). Their findings supported their theory over mental model theory. Evaluation The theory has several successes to its credit. First, the theory compares well against other theories of reasoning (Khemlani & Johnson-Laird, 2012; Johnson-Laird et al., 2018) and also performs well when predicting perfor- mance on Wason’s selection task (Ragni et al., 2018). Second, as predicted, working memory is involved in the construction of mental models. Third, there is substantial support for the principle of truth. Fourth, as discussed later (pp. 704–705), the theory has recently been developed to account for reasoning about probabilities (Johnson-Laird et al., 2015). What are the theory’s limitations? First, most people find deductive reasoning very hard and so resort to easier forms of processing (discussed shortly). Second, most people do not typically search for counterexamples as predicted theoretically. Third, the processes involved in forming mental models are underspecified. It is assumed people use background knowledge when forming mental models, but the theory does not spell how we decide which information to include in a mental model. Fourth, mental model theory often fails to predict people’s answers with ambiguous reasoning problems (e.g., Ragni & Knauff, 2013). Dual-process theories Several theorists (e.g., Kahneman, 2003; see Chapter 13 and Evans, 2018) have proposed dual-process (sometimes called dual-system) theoreti- cal accounts of human reasoning and other aspects of higher-level cog- nition. While they differ from each other in various ways, “dual-process theories should be viewed as a family whose members share some fea- tures . . . it includes close relatives . . . as well as distant cousins” (Evans, 2018, p. 151). Commonalities among dual-process theories are discussed below. Evans and Stanovich (2013a,b) provided an integrative account of dual-process theories based on a distinction between Type 1 intuitive pro- cessing and Type 2 reflective processing. One defining feature of Type 1 processing is autonomy (it is mandatory or necessary when the appropriate triggering stimuli are encountered). Its other defining feature is the lack of involvement of working memory (see Glossary). Note there is substantial diversity among Type 1 processes. In contrast, a defining feature of Type 2 processing is that it requires working memory.

Evans and Stanovich (2013a,b) also identified several features often (but not invariably) associated with the two types of processing. Features of Type 1 processing include the following: fast; high capacity; parallel; non-conscious; automatic; and independent of cognitive ability. Features of Type 2 processing include the following: slow; capacity-limited; serial; conscious; controlled; and correlated with cognitive ability. Evans and Stanovich (2013a,b) assumed that individuals trying to solve reasoning problems initially use intuitive Type 1 processing to gener- ate a rapid heuristic answer which may be corrected by a subsequent more deliberate answer produced via slow Type 2 processing. A key assumption is that reasoning performance will generally (but not invariably) be supe- rior when it involves Type 2 processing in addition to Type 1 processing. This approach is often referred to as the default-interventionist model. Why is it wrong to equate Type 1 processing with biased (and often incorrect) reasoning and Type 2 processing with correct reasoning? This question was addressed by Evans (2018). He pointed out that we have all had the experience of using effortful Type 2 processing when trying to solve a problem in mathematics without producing the correct response. In addition, correct reasoning does not always require Type 2 processing: “We often get things right via habit or reliable intuition [both involving Type 1 processing], as all dual-process authors agree” (p. 163). We will start by considering predictions made by early dual-process theories of reasoning (e.g., Evans, 2006). According to these theories, various factors increase reasoners’ use of time-consuming and effortful analytic or Type 2 processes: (1) the reasoners are highly intelligent; (2) sufficient time is available for Type 2 processing; (3) reasoners do not need to perform a secondary demanding task at the same time. Findings Much research to test the above predictions has focused on belief bias (dis- cussed earlier, pp. 678–679; see Ball & Thompson, 2018). This bias occurs in syllogistic reasoning when a logically valid but unbelievable conclu- sion is rejected as invalid, or a logically invalid but believable conclusion is accepted as valid. According to dual-process theories, there will be less belief bias (and superior performance) when Type 2 processes are used. Thus, reasoners’ use of Type 2 processes will generally reduce belief bias. There is much support for the first prediction that more intelligent rea- soners exhibit less belief bias than less intelligent ones (e.g., Trippas et al., 2013). More intelligent reasoners might show less belief bias because of their high cognitive ability or because they choose to adopt an analytic cognitive style. Trippas et al. (2015) found the willingness to engage in ana- lytic thinking was more important. These findings are consistent with dual- process theory because they emphasise the role played by Type 2 processes in reducing belief bias and enhancing reasoning performance.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nReasoning and hypothesis testing 685 There is also support for the second prediction that there should be less belief bias with ample thinking time (e.g., Evans and Curtis-Holmes, 2005) because restricting thinking time reduces reasoners’ ability to use Type 2 processes. In similar fashion, errors in conditional reasoning occur more often when reasoners must respond rapidly (Markovits et al., 2013; discussed earlier, p. 675). De Neys (2006) tested the third prediction above by presenting rea- soning problems on their own or with a secondary task low or high in its demands. As predicted, reasoners exhibited much more belief bias when performing a demanding secondary task. Theoretical differences and developments We have seen early dual-process theories of reasoning generated many pre- dictions supported by experimental evidence. However, these theories were oversimplified. For example, as we will see, the assumption that correct rea- soning performance reflects Type 2 processing whereas incorrect reasoning performance reflects Type 1 processing is only partially correct. Another oversimplification concerns the relationship between Type 1 and 2 processing during reasoning tasks. As we saw earlier, several theo- rists (e.g., Evans & Stanovich, 2013a) proposed serial models for reasoning in which Type 1 processing provides a rapid intuitive answer. This is often followed by slow Type 2 processing which may lead to the initial intuitive answer being corrected and replaced by a more reflective answer. De Neys (2012) argued the above theoretical position is too narrow and incomplete. He identified three models of how Type 1 and 2 processing combine (see Figure 14.4). (1) The traditional theoretical approach described above (serial model) involves serial processing with intuitive (or Type 1) processing being followed by deliberate (or Type 2) processing. Figure 14.4 Three models of the relationship between the intuitive and deliberate systems. (a) Serial model: intuitive processing may or may not be followed by deliberate processing. (b) Parallel model: intuitive and deliberate processing are both involved from the outset. (c) Logical intuition model: deliberate processing is triggered if there is a conflict between initial intuitive heuristic and intuitive logical responses produced in parallel. From De Neys (2012).

This model is wasteful of cognitive resources because effortful processes are always used. (3) According to the logical intuition model (advocated by De Neys, 2012, 2014), two types of intuitive responses (intuitive heuristic and intui- tive logical) are activated in parallel. If these two responses conflict, deliberate (Type 2) processes resolve matters. The notion of intuitive logical processing sounds paradoxical. However, De Neys argued that traditional logical principles can be activated fairly automatically. Findings Evidence consistent with the logical intuition model was reported by De Neys et al. (2010) using a syllogistic reasoning task involving conflict (or no conflict) between the logical validity and believability of the conclusions. There was strong belief bias – accuracy was only 52% on conflict (belief bias) trials compared to 89% on non-conflict trials. The very poor performance on conflict problems (marginally greater than chance) suggests reasoners failed to detect their logical structure. However, De Neys et al. (2010) found participants had greater physiolog- ical arousal on conflict trials suggesting conflict was registered within the processing system below the conscious level. The implication is that some logical processing can be intuitive rather than analytic. Further support for the logical intuition model was reported by Trippas et al. (2016). Participants simply decided how much they liked various sen- tences. Sentences following logically from preceding sentences were rated more likeable than those that did not. Since the task made no reference to logical validity, this finding suggests participants had an implicit sensitivity to logical structure based primarily involving Type 1 processes. Bago and De Neys (2017) presented participants with various syllo- gistic reasoning problems involving conflict between the believability and validity of the conclusion. The participants provided two responses to each problem: (1) a fast, intuitive response; and (2) a much slower and more deliberate response. According to the default-interventionist model (e.g., Evans & Stanovich, 2013a; discussed earlier, pp. 683–684), we would predict low levels of accurate fast responses and substantially more correct deliber- ate responses than intuitive ones. Neither prediction was supported. On average, 44% of the fast responses were accurate, and only 7% of initially inaccurate fast responses were followed by accurate slow responses. In one of their experiments, Bago and De Neys (2017) used the same syllogistic reasoning task described above. However, there was an additional requirement on participants – they performed a secondary demanding task at the same time to reduce their engagement in Type 2 analytic process- ing. Nevertheless, 49% of fast responses on conflict problems were correct. Overall, these findings support the logical intuition model in that fast (and presumably Type 1) processes often produce logically correct responses. Similar findings to those of Bago and De Neys (2017) have been reported in research on conditional reasoning (see Glossary; see pp. 673–676). Newman et al.

Reasoners provided a fast and a slow response to each problem. Contrary to the predictions of early dual- process theories, fast responses were often correct based on logical validity and slow responses were often incorrect and exhibited belief bias. These findings suggest a blurring of the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 processes – there was a mixture of logically correct and belief-based responses regardless of whether Type 1 processes (fast responses) or Type 2 processes (slow responses) were involved. Imagine we presented reasoners with conditional-reasoning problems involving a conflict between logical validity and believability (e.g., “If a child is happy, then it cries; suppose a child laughs; does it follow that the child is happy?”). According to logic, the correct answer is “No”. According to beliefs and our knowledge of the world, the answer is “Yes”. Trippas et al. (2017) used problems like that but with the novel twist that reasoners were sometimes told to answer the question based on their beliefs rather than logic. According to early dual-process theories (e.g., the default-intervention- ist model), responding on the basis of belief should involve Type 1 process- ing and so should be faster than responding on the basis of logic (involving Type 2 processing). In addition, the believability of the conclusion (accessed rapidly) should interfere with logic-based responses (accessed slowly) but the reverse should not be the case. Neither prediction was supported (Trippas et al., 2017). Response times were comparable on belief-based and logic-based trials, and the logical validity of the conclusion interfered with belief-based responding. However, these findings are entirely consistent with parallel-processing theories. Thompson et al. (2018) carried out a similar study. Participants differ- ing in cognitive ability received incongruent reasoning problems involving a conflict between belief and logic and had to respond on the basis of belief or logic. There were two main findings (see Figure 14.5): 1.0 Incongruent 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 1st quartile 2nd quartile 3rd quartile 4th quartile Logic Proportion correct Belief Figure 14.5 Proportion correct on incongruent syllogisms as a function of instructions (respond on the basis of logic or belief) and cognitive ability (1st quartile = lowest; 4th quartile = highest).

(2) The less intelligent reasoners exhibited the opposite pattern. These findings suggest more intelligent individuals generate logic-based responses faster than belief-based ones, whereas less intelligent individuals generate belief-based responses faster. What conclusions should we draw? First, rather than arguing belief- based responses involve fast Type 1 processing whereas logic-based responses involve slow Type 2 processing, we need to consider individ- ual differences. Second, “If responses (belief- or logic-based) can be gen- erated either quickly and effortlessly or slowly and deliberately, perhaps these responses merely differ on a single dimension, namely, complexity” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 1165). What causes Type 2 processing? What determines whether reasoners’ responses are based on analytic (Type 2) processing or whether they reflect only intuitive (Type 1) processes? The theories discussed above address this issue. Traditional serial models assume that Type 2 processes monitor the output of Type 1 processes and it is this monitoring process that determines whether reasoning performance is based on Type 2 processes. In similar fashion, many parallel models assume Type 2 reasoning is triggered when conflict monitoring (involving Type 2 processing) leads to conflict detection. What is puzzling about all these theories is that, “They assume that Type 2 processing is effectively caused by itself” (Pennycook et al., 2015, p. 36). Ackerman and Thompson (2017, p. 607) provided a detailed account of meta-reasoning: “The processes that monitor the progress of our rea- soning and problem-solving activities and regulate the time and effort devoted to them” (see Figure 14.6). Monitoring processes assess the proba- bility of success before, during and after performing a reasoning task. The most important monitoring feature is the feeling of rightness: “the degree to which the first solution that comes to mind feels right” (p. 608). Only when this feeling is weak do reasoners engage in substantial Type 2 or analytic processing. Thompson et al. (2011) studied the role of feeling-of-rightness ratings on the use of Type 2 processes with syllogistic and conditional-reasoning tasks. Participants provided an initial answer immediately after reading each problem (intuitive, or Type 1, answer) followed by an assessment of that answer’s correctness (feeling of rightness). Participants then had unlimited time to reconsider their initial answer and provide a final ana- lytic, or Type 2, answer. As predicted, participants spent longer reconsider- ing their intuitive answer and were more likely to change it when they had low feelings of rightness. What determines feeling-of-rightness ratings? Thompson et al. (2013b) addressed this issue in a study on syllogistic reasoning. Participants produced the first response that came to mind, provided a feeling-of- rightness rating, and then produced a slower, more deliberate response.

Most research indicates response fluency is a fallible measure of response accuracy. For example, people give higher feeling-of-rightness ratings to reasoning problems having familiar rather than unfamiliar content even when the former problems are harder (Ackerman & Thompson, 2017). Evaluation What are the strengths of the contemporary dual-process approach? First, dual-process theories have become increasingly popular and wide-ranging. For example, they provide explanations for syllogistic reasoning and con- ditional reasoning (Verschueren et al, 2005, discussed earlier, pp. 674–675). In addition, such theories account for findings in problem solving (see Chapter 12), judgement and decision-making (see Chapter 13). Second, “Dual-process theory . . . provides a valuable high-level framework within which more specific and testable models can be developed” (Evans, 2018, p. 163). Third, there have been increasingly sophisticated attempts to clarify the relationship between Type 1 and Type 2 processes (e.g., whether they are used serially or in parallel). Fourth, we have an enhanced understand- ing of meta-reasoning processes (especially those involved in monitoring). Fifth, recent theory and research are starting to take account of the flexi- bility of processing on reasoning problems due to the precise form of the problem and individual differences (Thompson et al., 2018). What are the limitations with the dual-process approach? First, the pro- cesses used by reasoners vary depending on their abilities and preferences, Identify components and goal Analytic processing Answer choice Final confdence Feeling of error Final judgement of solvability Intermediate confdence Feeling of rightness Initial judgement of solvability Assessment of knowledge and strategies Meta-cognitive monitoring Meta-cognitive control Think?

Melnikoff and Bargh (2018; see Chapter 13) identified two ways many dual-process theories are over- simplified: (1) they often imply that Type 1 processes are “bad” and error- prone, whereas Type 2 processes are “good”; and (2) they assume many cognitive processes can be assigned to just two types. Second, “The absence of a clear and general definition of a Type 1 or Type 2 response does create difficulty for researchers wishing to test [dual-process] theories” (Evans, 2018, p. 163). For example, it is often assumed theoretically that fast responses reflect Type 1 processing and are error-prone whereas slow responses reflect Type 2 processing and are gen- erally accurate. However, we have discussed various studies disconfirming those assumptions. Third, there has been a rapid increase in the findings that require to be explained theoretically, and theories have not kept pace with this increase. For example, meta-reasoning often plays an important role in influenc- ing reasoners’ processing strategies and performance. As yet, however, no theorists have integrated meta-reasoning processes into a comprehensive dual-process theory of reasoning. BRAIN SYSTEMS IN REASONING In recent years, there has been increased research designed to identify the brain regions associated with deductive reasoning. Prado et al. (2011) reported a meta-analytic review of 28 neuroimaging studies on deductive reasoning (see Figure 14.7). They obtained evidence for a core brain system centred in the left hemisphere involving frontal and parietal areas. Specific brain areas activated during deductive reasoning included the inferior frontal gyrus, the medial frontal gyrus, the precentral gyrus and the basal ganglia. Coetzee and Monti (2018) reported findings broadly consistent with those of Prado et al. (2011). They used fMRI to assess brain activation while participants performed deductive-reasoning tasks. There were two key findings. First, core regions (left rostrolateral cortex, in BA10; medial prefrontal cortex, in BA8) were more strongly activated with complex (rather than) simple deductive reasoning. Second, the main language areas Figure 14.7 Brain regions most consistently activated across 28 studies of deductive reasoning.

The left hemisphere dominance reported by Prado et al. (2011) has also been found in patient data. Goel et al. (2007) studied patients with damage to the left or right parietal cortex. Those with left-side damage performed worse than those with right-side damage on reasoning tasks when complete information was provided. In similar fashion, Reverberi et al. (2009) found patients with damage to the right frontal cortex had intact deductive rea- soning whereas those with left frontal damage showed reasoning deficits. Strong evidence for the crucial role of the left hemisphere in deduc- tive reasoning was reported by Urbanski et al. (2016) in a meta-analytic review (see Chapter 12). Impaired analogical reasoning was more strongly associated with damage to the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex area than damage to any other area. Goel and Waechter (2018) provide an overview of research on reasoning in brain-damage patients. How can we explain the left hemisphere’s role in deductive reason- ing? Gazzaniga et al. (e.g., 2008; see Chapter 16) argued there is a single conscious system based in the left hemisphere. This system is the inter- preter, which tries to make coherent sense of the information available to it. According to Prado et al. (2011), the core brain system they identified in the left hemisphere may depend at least in part on this interpreter. Individual differences Large individual differences have been found in belief bias (the tendency to accept invalid but believable conclusions and reject valid but unbelievable ones). As we saw earlier, more intelligent individuals exhibit less belief bias because they make more use of analytic processing strategies (e.g., Trippas et al., 2015, see p. 684). According to Houdé and Borst’s (2015) inhibitory control theory of reasoning, the ability to inhibit incorrect responses pro- duced by Type 1 thinking is of crucial importance in reducing belief bias. Houdé and Borst’s (2015) theory was based in part on research by Tsujii and Watanabe (2009). They argued the right inferior frontal cortex is involved in inhibiting incorrect responses triggered by Type 1 processes. Accordingly, they predicted individuals with high levels of activation in that area would have less belief bias than those with low activation. In their study, the reasoning task was accompanied by a secondary task involving low or high cognitive load. The findings supported their hypothesis (see Figure 14.8). High per- formance accuracy (and thus low belief bias) were strongly associated with activation in the right inferior frontal cortex regardless of secondary task. In addition, this brain region was less activated under high- than low-load conditions and there was much more belief bias in the high-load condition. Sequence of processes Neuroimaging data typically indicate the brain areas activated during rea- soning, but provide no information about when each brain area was acti- vated. Bonnefond et al. (2013) used magneto-encephalography (MEG) KEY TERM Magneto- encephalography (MEG) A non-invasive brain- scanning technique based on recording the magnetic fields generated by brain activity; it has good spatial and temporal resolution.

Bonnefond et al. (2013) reported two main findings. First, participants expected the second premise to match the first one (e.g., P following If P then Q): there was enhanced brain activity 300 ms after presentation of the second premise when it failed to match the first one. Second, when the second premise matched the first one, participants generated the infer- ence that followed validly from the two premises (activation in the parieto- frontal network at 400 ms). This occurred sometime before the conclusion was presented. Thus, participants engaged in much anticipatory processing before the second premise and conclusion were presented. More evidence that reasoners form expectations was reported by Bonnefond et al. (2014) in a study on conditional reasoning involving valid modus ponens inferences. Here is an example: Premises If John studies hard, he will pass the test. He studies hard. Conclusion John passes the test.

However, many people can readily think of additional considerations making the conclusion invalid (e.g., John has a low IQ; the test was very hard). Bonnefond et al. (2014) recorded event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) while participants read the conclusion. They reported two key findings. First, valid conclusions were much less likely to be accepted when there were several additional considerations rather than only a few. Second, presentation of a valid conclusion was more associated with an ERP pattern indicative of violated expectations when there were several additional considerations. Evaluation What are the strengths of the cognitive neuroscience approach to reason- ing? According to Goel and Waechter (2018, p. 240), its main contribution has been “the fractionation of the [reasoning] system and the identification of some of the component parts, such as a conflict detection system [and] a system sensitive to conceptual content”. However, Goel and Waechter admitted the data tell us little about how these systems interact. Second, progress has been made in identifying important executive or control processes involved in effective deductive reasoning. For example, it appears that inhibitory processes are used to prevent incorrect responses (e.g., Houdé & Borst, 2015). Third, many reasoners form expectations in conditional reasoning prior to the presentation of the second premise and the conclusion. This anticipatory processing is an important new finding given that reasoners might equally well await the presentation of the conclusion before engag- ing in full processing. What are the limitations of the cognitive neuroscience approach? First, much research is based on oversimplified assumptions (e.g., there is a “rea- soning module”: Goel & Waechter, 2018, p. 232). In fact, “The brain did not develop a dedicated device for reasoning . . . Reasoning . . . is associ- ated with an internally-driven dynamics: processing times and stages, and brain geometry are largely unconstrained” (Papo, 2015, p. 2). Second, relatively little research has focused on testing contemporary theories (e.g., dual-process theories). For example, only a few studies (e.g., Bonnefond et al., 2014) have provided evidence of the brain areas associ- ated with Type 1 intuitive processing (Oaksford, 2015). Third, and related to the second point, most research in this area has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; see Glossary). It has limited temporal resolution meaning we cannot establish precisely when any given brain area is involved in reasoning. This makes it hard to iden- tify rapid Type 1 processes using fMRI. Fourth, there are problems with Prado et al.’s (2011) identification of their core left-hemisphere brain system with Gazzaniga’s interpreter. This is problematical since the interpreter is not specifically involved in deductive reasoning but is more involved in drawing elaborative inferences (Oaksford, 2015).

As mentioned earlier, these limitations have led to the rapid development of research on informal reasoning (see Glossary) designed to assess how rea- soning depends on knowledge and experience rather than logic. The switch in research from formal or deductive reasoning to infor- mal reasoning is very important. Elqayam (2018, p. 145) discussed the emergence of a new paradigm, according to which “We reason, not with the binary truth and falsity of classical logic, but with the many shades of uncertainty and of degrees of belief”. Thus, the contemporary focus is on probabilities. The content of an argument is generally important in informal reason- ing but (in principle) is irrelevant in formal deductive reasoning. Consider the following superficially similar arguments (Hahn & Oaksford, 2007): (a) Ghosts exist because no one has proved they do not. (b) The drug is safe because we have found no evidence that it is not. The implausibility of ghosts existing means most people find (a) much less persuasive than (b). Another difference is that contextual factors are important in informal reasoning but not formal deductive reasoning. For example, in informal reasoning we are typically more persuaded by an expert’s arguments than those of a non-expert (Walton, 2010). We turn now to the most important difference between deductive and informal reasoning. As Elqayam (2018) noted, traditional research on deductive reasoning is based on binary logic. We must assume the initial premises or statements in a problem are definitely true and then we decide whether the conclusion necessarily follows (answering “yes” or “no”). In contrast, informal (or everyday) reasoning is all about probabilities – we regard most statements, arguments or conclusions as possibly or probably true rather than certainly true or certainly false. We can see the importance of the above differences by considering fallacies (Hahn & Oaksford, 2014). Take the straw man fallacy in which someone else’s views are misrepresented by distorting or weakening them. According to classical logic, such fallacies are totally inadequate arguments unsupported by logic. However, that position is too extreme given there are various forms of straw man argument (Aikin & Casey, 2016). One version of the straw man fallacy (the weak man fallacy) involves selecting one’s opponent’s weakest arguments without distorting them and then trying to demolish. This version seems legitimate and so is not a fallacy. There is more on fallacies shortly (see pp. 700–701). Finally, the reasoner’s motives often differ in deductive reasoning com- pared to informal reasoning. Individuals solving deductive-reasoning prob- lems are supposed to be motivated to reason accurately and logically. In contrast, much informal reasoning occurs in social contexts and involves producing arguments that will persuade other people. More generally, people are “natural-born arguers” (Mercier et al., 2017, p. 1), and “their KEY TERM Straw man fallacy Refuting an opponent’s views by misrepresenting them in some way.

In sum, there several differences between deductive and informal rea- soning. However, the processes used by most individuals confronted by deductive-reasoning tasks are closer to informal than deductive reasoning. For example, many reasoners exhibit belief bias with syllogistic reasoning – they accept invalid but believable conclusions and reject valid but unbeliev- able ones (see earlier in the chapter, pp. 678–679). In essence, belief bias occurs when people make use of their world knowledge when reasoning even though they have been told to ignore such knowledge. Such find- ings suggest the value of studying informal reasoning processes directly by using informal-reasoning tasks rather than indirectly via the errors made on formal logic tasks. Findings: motivation Many people’s informal reasoning and thinking are seriously flawed. For example, tens of millions of Americans believe the moon landing was a hoax, that global warming is not a problem, and do not believe humans evolved from apes. Why is this the case? According to Thagard (2011, pp. 156–157), the answer lies in motivated inference, which “occurs when people distort their judgements because of their underlying personal goals . . . motivated inference is based on wishes, not facts”. Supporting evidence is discussed in the Box on climate change. IN THE REAL WORLD: DOES CLIMATE CHANGE EXIST? Over 95% of the world’s greatest experts on climate believe in climate change. However, many people refuse to accept this strong scientific consensus. Climate change deniers show evidence of distorted memory. For example, Howe and Leiserowitz (2013) tested Americans’ memory of the previous unusually hot summer. Those most dismissive of global warming were only half as likely as those most alarmed by it to remember the preceding summer had been very hot. Leviston et al. (2013) discovered another distortion. Australian disbelievers in climate change grossly overestimated the percentage of other people holding the same views (43% vs the actual figure of 6%). Individuals exhibiting this high false consensus bias were less likely than others to change their opinions over time. Cann and Raymond (2018) reported evidence that those opposing climate change increas- ingly resort to attacks on the integrity of climate scientists rather than the uncertainties of climate science. This is an example of the ad hominem fallacy – dismissing an argument by belittling the person advocating the argument. The association between beliefs about global warming and political ideology is strongest in the United States. For example, Kahan (2015) found 75% of Americans with left-wing or liberal views agreed there is solid evidence of global warming compared to only 22% of those with right-wing or conservative views. In general, Americans strongly supporting the industrial capitalist system (e.g., right-wing individuals; men) are most likely to be sceptical of global warming (McCright et al., 2016). Campbell and Kay (2014) asked right-wing Americans to indicate whether they believed in climate change in the context of two possible solutions (restrictive emissions policies or green technol- ogy). Far fewer indicated a belief in climate change when the proposed solution was undesirable KEY TERM Ad hominem fallacy Discrediting an argument by attacking the person making the argument.

It is irrational because the existence of climate change is totally independent of the desirability of any proposed solutions. We might expect individuals having high science literacy and numeracy to be most concerned about climate change. In fact, cultural values are much more important. Kahan et al. (2012) iden- tified two groups having different values: (1) egalitarian communitarians believing in equality and the value of society; (2) hierarchical individualists believing in a hierarchical society and personal responsibility. Both groups estimated the risks of climate change. What did Kahan et al. (2012) find? First, the impact of science literacy and numeracy was surpris- ingly small (see Figure 14.9). Second, egalitarian communitarians regarded climate-change risks as considerably greater than hierarchical individualists. How can we explain the above findings? In essence, “Positions on climate change have come to signify the kind of person one is. People whose beliefs are at odds with those of the people with whom they share their basic cultural commitments risk being labelled as weird” (Kahan, 2012, p. 255). This explains why many disbelievers in climate change largely ignore the scientific evi- dence and show a false consensus bias.

Students who regularly drank alcohol rated the accuracy of proposition (1) lower than those who did not. Women rated the accuracy of proposition (2) lower than men. Thus, there was strong myside bias with its extent depending on the strength of par- ticipants’ prior beliefs. However, the extent of myside bias was unrelated to cognitive ability or intelligence suggesting participants made little use of analytical thinking. These findings were replicated in subsequent research (Stanovich et al., 2013). Čavojová et al. (2018) conducted a stronger test of the existence of myside bias. Participants (who had pro-life or pro-choice views with respect to abortion) were presented with abortion-relevant syllogisms (see Glossary; and pp. 678–679). They were instructed to assume the two prem- ises were valid and decide whether the conclusion followed logically from them. Evidence was obtained for myside bias – participants found it hard to accept logically valid conclusions conflicting with their beliefs and to reject invalid conclusions coinciding with their beliefs. Thus, myside bias can be found even when people are instructed not to allow their beliefs to influence their reasoning. How can we reduce myside bias? McCrudden et al. (2017) asked par- ticipants to rate the strength of arguments concerning climate change from their own perspective and also from that of a climate scientist. Adopting the perspective of a climate scientist eliminated myside bias when rating weak arguments but not strong arguments. Thus, perspective taking can produce a modest decrease in myside bias. Before proceeding, we should note the motivation to support one’s own beliefs or view sometimes improves performance. Earlier (p. 677), we discussed Dawson et al.’s (2002) study using the Wason selection task. Individuals strongly motivated to disprove the rule because it implied they would die young showed much more accurate reasoning than those lacking such motivation. Argumentative theory Mercier (e.g., 2016) proposed an argumentative theory of reasoning empha- sising the importance of argumentation. For example, according to Mercier (2018, p. 1), “Reason is a specific cognitive mechanism that evolved so that humans can exchange justifications and arguments with each other.” Mercier (2016, p. 690) claimed that his theory provided an explanation for myside bias: The function of argument production is to convince someone in an interactive setting. Conviction can hardly be achieved by providing interlocutors [others involved in a discussion] with arguments for their views or against that of the speaker. Argument production should thus be marked by a strong myside bias.

Support for argumentative theory was reported by Trouche et al. (2016). Participants solved syllogistic reasoning problems, produced argu- ments for their answers, and then evaluated other people’s arguments for the same problems. The key condition was one in which participants eval- uated their own arguments but were led to believe these arguments were someone else’s. Participants not detecting this deception were highly criti- cal of their own arguments, rejecting them 56% of the time. Of importance, they were more likely to reject their own arguments for invalid answers than valid ones (66% vs 41%, respectively). Thus, the participants were more critical and better able to discriminate between valid and invalid arguments when they believed they were someone else’s. In a second experiment, Trouche et al. (2016) presented syllogisms and asked participants to provide “fast, intuitive answers”. After that, they pro- vided arguments for their answers and were able to change their answer. The arguments participants provided for their invalid answers were gener- ally superficial with only 17% of these answers being changed. These find- ings provide further evidence that most individuals are not critical of their own arguments. Evaluation Informal reasoning is far more important than deductive reasoning in our everyday lives. Motivational factors (e.g., myside bias; desire to win argu- ments by persuading others) play a major role in informal reasoning. In the case of climate change, people’s views are often much more strongly influenced by their notions concerning the kind of person they regard them- selves as being than by the available research evidence. What are the limitations of the research discussed so far? First, we lack a comprehensive theory clarifying how motivational factors influence infor- mal reasoning. Second, several studies (e.g., Kahan et al., 2012; Stanovich & West, 2007) have found surprisingly small differences in informal rea- soning between individuals of high and low cognitive ability or intelligence. More research is needed to establish whether this is a general finding or whether it depends on the precise nature of the reasoning task. Findings: probabilities As noted earlier, probabilities are much more important in informal than in deductive reasoning (e.g., we believe statements are possibly or proba- bly true). In contrast, statements in formal logic are true or false – there is no half-way house. The Bayesian approach (also discussed in Chapter 13 and below), focuses on probabilities. According to this approach, our prior beliefs have subjective probabilities associated with them based on our knowledge and experience. These subjective probabilities are changed (increased or decreased) as we encounter new evidence. Support for the Bayesian approach was reported by Hahn and Oaksford (2007). They identified several factors influencing the perceived strength of a conclusion: Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["ne’s own beliefs or to generate reasons or arguments supporting those beliefs.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

Hahn and Oaksford (2007) studied the above factors using scenarios such as the following (note that digesterole is a fictitious drug): Barbara: Are you taking digesterole for it? Adam: Yes, why? Barbara: Well, because I strongly believe that it does have side-effects. Adam: It does have side-effects. Barbara: How do you know? Adam: Because I know of an experiment in which they found side-effects. This scenario presents a strong prior belief (i.e., strongly believe), a posi- tive belief (i.e., it has side-effects) and weak evidence (i.e., one experiment). The three factors were manipulated in other versions of this scenario. Participants decided how strongly Barbara should now believe the conclu- sion the drug has side-effects. Argument strength was regarded as greater when the prior belief was strong rather than weak, when the prior belief was positive rather than negative, and when the evidence was strong rather than weak. Thus, as predicted by the Bayesian approach, ratings of argument strength took account of Barbara’s prior beliefs and the strength of the new evidence. In addition, Hahn and Oaksford (2007) found a model based on the Bayesian approach provided an excellent fit to the data. Harris et al. (2016) carried out a similar study where participants received fictional medical information (e.g., concerning whether Pfortanine lowers cholesterol). Three factors were manipulated: (1) expert vs non- expert opinion; (2) trustworthiness of the expert/non-expert: high (friend) vs low (enemy); and (3) opinion of other experts: agreed with expert/non- expert; disagreed with expert/non-expert; or not mentioned. Participants indicated their degree of belief in the medical information by providing convincingness ratings. All three factors had the predicted effects: convincingness was higher with expert than non-expert opinion, with a friend’s opinion rather than an enemy’s, and with other experts agreeing rather than disagreeing. Some findings are shown in Figure 14.10. A Bayesian model predicted the con- vincingness ratings extremely well. Hornikx et al. (2018) investigated the impact of expert opinion in more detail. They presented scenarios in which an expert’s opinion differed from that of laypeople. There were five levels of expert expertise and five levels of layperson expertise. Participants indicated how many laypeople they thought were required to counter the expert’s opinion. According to the Bayesian approach, participants should have been sensitive to the expertise of the expert and the laypeople in their responses. Thus, the number of laypeople required should increase as the expert’s expertise increases and that of lay- people decreases. The findings were in general agreement with prediction.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\n700 Thinking and reasoning Within the framework of traditional reasoning research, several types of arguments were classified as “fallacies”. For example, consider the slippery-slope argument, according to which a small first step will lead to a chain of events producing an undesirable outcome. One such argu- ment (from Corner et al., 2011) is as follows: “If voluntary euthanasia is legalised, then in the future there will be more cases of ‘medical murder’.” Another example concerns genetic engineering, which, it has been argued, will inevitably lead to attempts to create a super race of human beings (Walton, 2017). As mentioned earlier, so-called “fallacies” were rejected as totally invalid according to classical logic. In contrast, it is assumed within the Bayesian approach that most so-called fallacies involve weak conclusions poorly supported by the evidence presented. According to this approach, then, we should not reject all slippery-slope arguments. Such arguments vary in strength, with strong arguments being regarded as more persuasive than weak ones. Two important factors determining argument strength are: (1) the probability of the negative outcome; and (2) how negative the outcome would be. Thus, strong slippery-slope arguments are those where the negative outcome is both highly probable and very undesirable. Corner et al. (2011) tested the above predictions using various topics (e.g., legislation of euthanasia; introduction of ID cards). As predicted, both factors influenced the assessment of argument strength (see Figure 14.11). Haigh et al. (2016) pointed out that slippery-slope arguments are typ- ically perceived to be arguments implying resistance to change. They then hypothesised such arguments will only be perceived as persuasive when it is clear the speaker is resistant to change. That is exactly what they found. This finding indicates the importance of a contextual factor (i.e., the speak- er’s beliefs). As such, it is entirely consistent with the Bayesian approach with its emphasis on perceived persuasiveness being influenced by all rele- vant factors. 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Enemy Mean convincingness ratings (%) Trustworthiness Friend No mention Agree Disagree Figure 14.10 Effects of trustworthiness and others’ opinions on convincingness ratings.

Several factors (e.g., strength of prior beliefs; strength of evidence) influencing the rated strength of informal arguments have been identified. The Bayesian approach accounts for the per- ceived strength (or otherwise) of the argu- ments within so-called fallacies. The Bayesian approach has generated precise models pre- dicting accurately the perceived strength of conclusions in informal reasoning. Other the- oretical approaches have proved less success- ful (Hahn & Hornikx, 2016). What are the limitations of the Bayesian approach? Bowers and Davis (2012) argued it is too flexible and thus hard to falsify. For example, the strength of prior beliefs is often not assessed with precision. This argument is too sweeping in two ways. First, Bayesian models vary considerably in terms of their fal- sifiability (Hahn, 2014). Second, we must distinguish between model flexibility and vague predictions. Bayesian models are often flexible in terms of their assump- tions. However, many such models make precise predictions from those assumptions (Hahn, 2014). For example, Harris et al. (2012) studied the ad hominem fallacy (see Glossary). The convincingness of an argument was systematically affected when it was attributed to Hitler. Of most impor- tance, however, the perceived persuasiveness of ad hominem arguments was influenced by the content of the arguments. Of note, a Bayesian model provided a precise quantitative fit to the data. Third, while Bayesian models accurately predict the perceived effec- tiveness of arguments, they often fail to identify the underlying processes. According to the Bayesian approach, informal reasoning involves exten- sive use of probabilities. However, “People flounder with even the simplest probability questions . . . How can a supposedly Bayesian brain reason so poorly with probabilities?” (Sanborn & Chater, 2016, p. 883). As yet, it remains somewhat unclear how we use probabilities in numerous cognitive tasks (including informal reasoning). ARE HUMANS RATIONAL? Much research discussed in this chapter and the previous two apparently indicates deficient and irrational human thinking and reasoning. For example, we often fail on fairly simple problems (e.g., Frederick’s Cognitive Reflection Test), we generally ignore base-rate information when making Figure 14.11 Mean-rated argument strength as a function of the probability of the outcome (likely vs unlikely) and how negative the outcome would be (very negative vs moderately negative).

The above findings lead to an apparent paradox. Most people (but not all!) cope reasonably well with everyday problems and challenges but often seem “irrational” and “illogical” with laboratory thinking and reasoning problems. We can resolve this paradox by assuming our everyday thinking is less rational than we like to believe, whereas our thinking and reasoning in the laboratory is more rational than often supposed. With respect to the latter point, laboratory deductive-reasoning tasks are often very arti- ficial: background knowledge is totally irrelevant, and conclusions involve certainties (i.e., valid vs invalid) rather than varying levels of probability. Before examining the relevant evidence, we must consider what we mean by “human rationality”. As we will see, there is controversy concern- ing the appropriate definition. Bounded rationality Simon considered the issue of human rationality at length (Schraagen, 2018). He argued behaviour is rational “in so far as it selects alternatives . . . conducive to the achievement of previously selected goals” (Simon, 1945, p. 5). Thus, an individual’s informal reasoning is rational if it achieves their goal of arguing persuasively even if it differs from the experimenter’s prior expectations (e.g., by demonstrating myside bias; see Glossary). Simon (1957) argued we possess bounded rationality (our thinking and decision-making are “bounded” by environmental constraints (e.g., infor- mation costs) and cognitive constraints (e.g., limited attention). This allows us to produce workable solutions to problems in spite of limited processing ability by using various short-cut strategies (e.g., heuristics). More specif- ically, our thinking is “bounded” or constrained by the environment and processing constraints (e.g., limited attention; limited short-term memory). According to Simon (1990, p. 7), “Human rational behaviour is shaped like a scissors whose blades are the structure of task environments and the computational capabilities of the actor.” If we consider only one blade, we will have only a partial understanding of human thinking. In sum, many “errors” in human thinking reflect limited processing capacity rather than irrationality. As mentioned above, Simon also argued such “errors” can also reflect environmental constraints. Simon’s definition of “bounded rationality” included factors such as incomplete knowledge, problems in anticipating future consequences and limited behavioural alter- natives. As Schraagen (2018, p. 488) pointed out, “These issues have more to do with the complexity of the environment that humans find themselves in than with their limited information processing capacities.” Instrumental vs broad rationality Deciding whether humans are rational depends on how we define “ration- ality”. Historically, an important approach (championed by Piaget, Wason and many others) claimed rational thought is governed by logic. It follows that deductive reasoning (which many have thought requires logical think- ing) is very relevant for assessing human rationality. Sadly, most people KEY TERM Bounded rationality The notion that people are as rational as the environment and their limited processing capacity permit.

Thus, humans are irrational if we define rationality as logical reasoning. The above approach exemplifies normativism. Normativism “is the idea that human thinking reflects a normative system [one conforming to norms or standards] against which it should be measured and judged” (Elqayam & Evans, 2011, p. 233). For example, human thinking is “correct” only if it conforms to classical logic. Logic (or deductive reasoning) does not provide a suitable normative system for evaluating human thinking. Why is that? As Sternberg (2011, p. 270) pointed out, “Few problems of consequence in our lives had a deductive or even any meaningful kind of ‘correct’ solution. Try to think of three, or even one!” We can make headway by distinguishing two broad types of rational- ity (Stanovich, 2013, 2016). First, there is instrumental rationality, which involves “the maximisation of expected utility [subjective value associated with our choices or decisions]” (Stanovich, 2016, p. 24). We could label this thin rationality because it is narrowly focused on the current task. Second, there is broad rationality, which involves taking account of the individual’s personal goals and contextual factors (especially social ones) additional to the immediate task goals. One type of broad rationality was labelled “social rationality” by Hoffrage et al. (2018). Social rationality “is concerned with goals, such as choosing an option that one can defend with argument or moral justification, or that can create a consensus” (pp. 331–332). In Chapter 13, we discussed Tetlock’s (2002) social func- tionalist approach, which focuses on social rationality and the role played by accountability in decision-making. We will clarify the above distinction. Consider a situation where indi- viduals must decide between risking harm through inaction and risking harm through action. An example would be a parent deciding whether to have their child vaccinated against various diseases. If the decision is to select the option where the probability of harm is less, the decision would be based on instrumental rationality. However, as Brewer et al. (2016) found in a meta-analysis, such deci- sions are often strongly influenced by anticipated regret (i.e., the option involving less anticipated regret is selected). Thus, the decision to select the option having less instrumental rationality may be selected because it is associated with less anticipated regret. It is arguable that such decisions are consistent with broad rationality. In sum, we should distinguish between thin or instrumental rational- ity and broad rationality. We may exaggerate human irrationality if we focus only on instrumental or thin rationality. However, it is often hard to decide whether an individual is demonstrating broad rationality. Why is that? Broad rationality involves thinking and reasoning consistent with an individual’s goals, but these goals are often unclear. Findings Stanovich (2013) compared rationality in humans and other species. If we focus on instrumental rationality, other species sometimes outperform humans. For example, Pope et al. (2015; see Chapter 12) found baboons KEY TERMS Normativism The notion that human thinking should be regarded as “correct” or “incorrect” depending on how closely it follows certain norms or standards (e.g., those of classical logic).

How can we explain such surprising findings? Humans are far more likely than other species to pursue complex goals not directly relevant to the current task. The fact that our cognitive processes and goals are often complex means human thinking can often be regarded as rational even when it does not correspond to instrumental rationality. Here we will consider another example of the sunk-cost effect (see Glossary). Two people decide to go on a holiday for which they have paid a non-refundable deposit even though they both feel slightly unwell on the way there and think they would prefer to go home (Dawes, 1988; see Chapter 13). Keys and Schwartz (2007) argued some participants may well have taken into account the regret they would experience if they returned home having forfeited the deposit. In that case, it might be more “rational” to exhibit the sunk-cost effect. Thus, we should distinguish between the decision and its consequences. According to Keys and Schwartz, the anticipated experience following a decision often “leaks” into the decision-making process. “Leakage” may also explain apparently irrational framing effects (see Glossary and Chapter 13). Most people choose beef labelled “75% lean” rather than beef labelled “25% fat”, which seems irrational (Levin & Gaeth, 1988). However, the labelling influenced participants’ experience: the 75% lean beef tasted better than the 25% fat beef. Thus, we could argue participants’ choices were rational. Findings such as those discussed above may suggest human think- ing and behaviour typically correspond to broad rationality. However, there are plentiful exceptions (more are discussed shortly). In one study (Koehler & James, 2009) 40 marbles were drawn from a bag: 30 were green and 10 red. Participants guessed the colours of 20 more marbles drawn as replacements from the bag. The optimal strategy is maximising (i.e., choosing green every time). However, most participants used proba- bility matching (i.e., guessing green about 75% of the time). Subsequently, 39% of participants using probability matching acknowledged the supe- riority of maximising, thus accepting the inadequacy of their chosen strategy. Limitations of human rationality An important theoretical approach of relevance to the issue of human rationality is the dual-process (or dual-system) approach (reviewed by Evans & Stanovich, 2013a). In essence, it is assumed there is a rapid process (Type 1 or System 1) which is often followed by a slower process (Type 2 or System 2) that involves working memory. This theoretical approach has been applied to deductive reasoning (see earlier in this Chapter) and to judgement (Kahneman, 2003; see Chapter 13). It was originally assumed Type 2 or System 2 responses are gener- ally based on analytical, logical or rational processes, whereas Type 1 or System 1 responses reflect more intuitive processes. In fact, matters are much more complicated. Research on reasoning discussed (e.g., Newman et al., 2017; Trippas et al., 2017) indicates there is only modest evidence Case study: Exploring dual-system theories of deductive reasoning Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["e) of one’s choices or decisions with respect to achieving task-related goals.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

For example, there are numerous exceptions to the prediction that Type 2 or System 2 responses should be associated with far more correct answers on reasoning problems than Type 1 or System 1 responses (Evans, 2018). Oaksford and Hall (2016, p. 343) proposed a radical new theoreti- cal approach: “In a reversal of current wisdom [i.e., dual-system theory], System 1 is rational whereas System 2 leads to error.” Why did they propose this reversal? (1) They argued that other species rely primarily on System 1 but seem less prone than humans to serious cognitive biases. (2) System 2 depends heavily on working memory, but working memory is limited in its functioning (Johnson-Laird, 1983; see Chapter 6). (3) System 2 involves language often lacking in precision (e.g., individu- als differ greatly in their interpretations of words such as “probable” and “likely”). In sum, the assumptions that irrationality stems from System 1 and ration- ality from System 2 are seriously flawed. An interesting example of limited human rationality is the Dunning- Kruger effect (Kruger & Dunning, 1999), in which “those who are incompetent . . . have little insight into their incompetence” (Dunning, 2011, p. 260). Individuals largely unaware of their own thinking exhibit signs of “irrationality”. For example, Motta et al. (2018) found those knowing the least about the causes of autism were most likely to think they knew more than medical doctors about autism’s causes! Why does the Dunning-Kruger effect exist? Perhaps those showing the effect lack the knowledge and expertise to evaluate the correctness (or otherwise) of their own thinking. Dunning (2011) discussed a study using the Wason selection task (see earlier in the chapter, pp. 676–678). Some participants used the same correct rule across different versions of the task and so achieved a success rate of 100%. Other participants used the same incorrect rule consistently and had a 0% success rate. However, both groups believed they had solved between 80% and 90% of the problems correctly! Individual differences: intelligence Even though average performance on most judgement, decision-making and reasoning tasks appears relatively poor, it is still possible highly intelli- gent individuals perform consistently well. That is partially true (Stanovich, 2012). Students with high IQs perform better than those with lower IQs on many deductive-reasoning tasks. However, intelligence often only modestly predicts performance on judgement tasks (e.g., framing problems; sunk- cost effects; omission bias). For example, Toplak et al. (2011) obtained a correlation of +.32 between cognitive ability and performance across 15 judgement and decision tasks. Stanovich (2012) developed a tripartite model to explain the impact of intelligence on thinking and reasoning (see Figure 14.12).

Above that is Type 2 processing which is slow and effortful. Stanovich’s (2012) model has two major novel features. First, there are two levels of cognitive control at the higher level. One consists of Type 2 processes (the algorithmic mind) which contains mindware – “the rules, knowledge, procedures, and strategies that a person can retrieve from memory . . . to aid decision making and problem solving” (Stanovich, 2012, p. 355). The algorithmic mind can override the (often incorrect) heu- ristic responses generated by the autono- mous mind. Type 2 processes are only used when individuals realise that they are necessary and have sufficient motivation to initiate them. The other level of control involves the reflective mind which has access to individ- uals’ goals, beliefs and general knowledge. Deciding whether to use Type 2 processes involves the reflective mind. Second, the model considers individual differences in intelligence. Fluid intelligence is of direct relevance to the functioning of the algorithmic mind. Individuals high in fluid intelligence possess more Type 2 processes and use them more effi- ciently (Stanovich, 2012). Stanovich (2016) developed a test (the Comprehensive Assessment of Rational Thinking: the CART) to assess individual differences in the reflec- tive mind. The items in the CART (e.g., various heuristics and biases tasks; items based on the Cognitive Reflection Test: see Glossary) mostly involve a conflict between a readily available intuitive answer and the correct one. The development of the CART opens the way to more systematic study of the similarities and differences between the algorithmic and reflective minds. According to the tripartite model incorrect, intuition-based answers on problems can occur for three reasons: (1) Individuals may lack the appropriate mindware within the algorith- mic mind to override incorrect responses. (2) Individuals with the appropriate mindware may have insufficient pro- cessing capacity to override incorrect Type 1 processing using the algorithmic mind. (3) Individuals may have the appropriate mindware but fail to use it because its use is not triggered by the reflective mind. Figure 14.12 Stanovich’s tripartite model of reasoning. According to the model, Type 1 processing within the autonomous mind is typically fast and fairly automatic. There are two major forms of Type 2 processing: (1) the algorithmic mind, which contains information about rules, strategies and procedures; and (2) the reflective mind, which makes use of the individual’s goals and beliefs. Individual differences in reasoning are generally much greater with respect to the reflective mind and the algorithmic mind than the autonomous mind. From Stanovich (2012).

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.\n\nReasoning and hypothesis testing 707 Findings Several findings are consistent with the tripartite model. First, different measures of rational thinking typically correlate moderately with each other (e.g., Toplak et al., 2017 obtained correlations between +.26 and .60). This suggests rational thinking is a relatively general aspect of individual differences. Second, as predicted, rational thinking assessed by heuristics and bias tasks correlates moderately with active open-minded thinking assessed by self-report questionnaire (Toplak et al., 2017). Third, individual differences in rational thinking as assessed by heuristics and bias tasks (e.g., belief bias) predict several real-world outcomes (e.g., sound financial behav- iour; good security on computers) (Toplak et al., 2017). There are two important limitations with Stanovich’s approach. First, consider his claim that “rationality and intelligence are two different things” (Stanovich, 2016, p. 23). The CART (designed to assess ration- ality) correlates +.69 with measures of cognitive ability (e.g., analogies) (Ritchie, 2017). Thus, there is much overlap between rationality and intelligence. Second, and relatedly, there is only limited evidence concerning incre- mental validity (the extent to which a new test has predictive power over and above that provided by previous tests). For example, the relationship between rational thinking and real-world outcomes found by Toplak et al. (2017) may have been due mostly to individual differences in intelligence rather than to rational thinking itself. Conclusions What are the main arguments for human rationality? First, as argued by Simon (1957) with his notion of bounded rationality, human reasoning is generally moderately effective given constraints in our processing ability (e.g., limited attention; limited short-term memory) and environmental con- straints. Our lives mostly involve uncertain information and so our reason- ing and decision-making often appear “rational” when evaluated against Bayesian and other models of probabilistic thinking. Second, we should distinguish between thin and broad rationality (Stanovich, 2013). Human reasoning can seem “irrational” when consid- ered solely within the context of the current task (thin rationality) but “rational” when we take account of our personal goals. These goals can include the need to be accountable to others (Tetlock, 2002), the desire to win arguments (Mercier, 2018), and the wish to signify the kind of person one is (Kahan, 2012). Third, apparent “errors” involving heuristics (rules of thumb) often fail to indicate “irrationality”. As Maule and Hodgkinson (2002, p. 71) pointed out, “Often . . . people have to judge situations or objects that change over time, making it inappropriate to expend a good deal of time to make a precise judgment . . . an approximate judgement based on a simpler, less effortful heuristic may be much more appropriate.” What are the main arguments against human rationality? First, humans are often cognitive misers – even when they possess the necessary knowledge KEY TERM Incremental validity The ability of a new test to predict behaviour or other outcomes to a greater extent than existing tests.

For example, inac- curate performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005; see Chapter 12) often reflects a failure to use the reflective mind (Stanovich, 2012, 2016). Second, people often fail to think rationally because they are unaware of limitations and errors in their thinking (the Dunning-Kruger effect). They are also often too ready to accept incorrect responses associated with a strong feeling-of-rightness (Ackerman & Thompson, 2017). Third, we might expect experts to interpret correctly problems in their area of expertise and so avoid cognitive biases. However, medical experts often make biased judgements and decisions (Croskerry, 2018). Fourth, Camerer and Hogarth (1999) reviewed 74 studies concerned with the effects of motivation (financial incentives) on thinking and reason- ing. The provision of incentives rarely improved performance suggesting poor reasoning is not typically due to insufficient motivation. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. Inductive reasoning involves drawing general conclusions from statements referring to particular instances. These conclusions can never be shown to be definitely valid. Inductive reasoning is often used when testing scientific hypotheses. Deductive reasoning (originating in formal logic), allows us to draw definitely valid conclusions provided we assume other statements are true. It is of little relevance to everyday life. As a result, there has been a rapid increase in research on informal reasoning based on our knowledge and experience rather than logic. • Hypothesis testing. Wason argued that performance was poor on his 2-4-6 task because people show confirmation bias and rarely engage in falsification. However, there are many falsification attempts when participants test others’ hypotheses. The 2-4-6 task is unrepresentative of hypothesis testing because the rule is very general and so hard to discover. Scientists typically adopt a confirmatory approach when testing non-absolute hypotheses but a disconfirmatory or falsificatory approach when testing absolute or universal hypotheses. Many scientists show evidence of confirmation bias when analysing and interpreting their research findings. • Deductive reasoning. Performance is generally poor on conditional-reasoning problems. Such problems have their origins in propositional logic. However, researchers increasingly encourage participants to use their relevant knowledge and to think probabilistically on conditional-reasoning tasks. With Wason’s selection task, reasoners typically perform poorly unless the rule is deontic or they are motivated to disprove the rule because of concerns about future costs. Syllogistic reasoning is based on Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["o predict behaviour or other outcomes to a greater extent than existing tests.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

Performance is often poor because reasoners ignore the dictates of logic and interpret problems based on everyday meanings of expressions. This leads to incorrect reasoning (e.g., belief bias). • Theories of “deductive” reasoning. According to Johnson-Laird’s mental model theory, people form mental models representing what is common to a set of possibilities. As predicted, reasoners often reduce the load on working memory by forming mental models representing explicitly only what is true. There is much less search for counterexamples than assumed theoretically, the processes involved in forming mental models are underspecified, and most people engage in less deductive reasoning than assumed theoretically. According to early dual-process theories, reasoners initially use rapid, intuitive Type 1 processes generating an answer that is sometimes corrected by a slower and more deliberate answer based on analytic Type 2 processes. In contrast to this serial processing approach, recent dual-process theories (e.g., the logical intuition model) emphasise the importance of parallel Type 1 and Type 2 processes. These theories provide more detailed accounts of the monitoring processes determining whether reasoners accept the first answer they produce. They also focus on how the requirements of reasoning tasks and individual differences in reasoners’ abilities lead to considerable flexibility in reasoning strategies. • Brain systems in reasoning. Key brain regions (e.g., left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex; left parietal cortex) are involved in deductive reasoning. Individuals having superior inhibitory control abilities often outperform others on reasoning tasks (e.g., they are less likely to exhibit belief bias). Reasoners often engage in anticipatory processing in conditional reasoning (e.g., anticipating the second premise and conclusion). Much research in cognitive neuroscience is relatively uninformative concerning contemporary reasoning theories. Of relevance, fMRI’s limited temporal resolution means we cannot establish precisely when any given brain area is active. • Informal reasoning. Informal reasoning depends on the reasoner’s knowledge and experience as well as on the content of arguments and contextual factors. Motivational factors are often important with individuals seeking support for their beliefs (e.g., when arguing with others). The Bayesian approach based on the assumption that new information changes the probabilities of beliefs is more realistic than the traditional approach based on binary logic. For example, the Bayesian approach explains why so-called “fallacies” differ in persuasiveness, whereas the Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25.","evidence":["rule because of concerns about future costs.","Syllogistic reasoning is based on Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:25."]}

The Bayesian approach does not provide a detailed account of the processes involved in informal reasoning. • Are humans rational? Human rationality often seems “irrational” on many laboratory tasks because such tasks are often very artificial (e.g., background knowledge is irrelevant). We possess bounded rationality, which allows us to produce workable solutions to problems despite limited processing ability. Humans appear more rational if we focus on broad rationality, interpreting our reasoning performance with reference to our personal goals and the social context. Dual-system theories propose an oversimplified distinction between fast intuitive processes and slow analytical or rational processes. Human reasoning is often deficient because we have limited awareness of our own cognitive incompetence. More intelligent individuals perform better than less intelligent ones on reasoning (especially deductive reasoning) tasks. However, some intelligent individuals fail to think rationally because they are cognitive misers who use limited mental effort when solving problems.

In this section of the book, we con- sider two of the most important manifestations of that broadening. First, there is the issue of the ways in which emotion and mood are related to human cognition (Chapter 15). Second, there is the issue of consciousness (Chapter 16). It is appropriate to place these two topics here because both are relevant to most of the topics within cognitive psychology that we have discussed throughout the book. Emotional factors influence attention, perception, memory, language processing, judgements and decision-making. In addi- tion, our current mood state is strongly influenced by cognitive processes. So far as consciousness is concerned, it is important to distinguish between conscious and non-conscious processes when studying almost any aspect of human cognition. COGNITION AND EMOTION The origins of the notion that our emotional states are partly determined by our cognitions go back at least as far as Aristotle over two thousand years ago. Aristotle (who may have been the cleverest person who ever lived) had this to say: “Let fear, then, be a kind of pain or disturbance resulting from the imagination of impending danger” (quoted by Power & Dalgleish, 2008, p. 35). The key word is “imagining” – how much fear we experience depends on our expectations. Aristotle developed this point: “Those in great prosperity . . . would not expect to suffer; nor those who reckon they have already suffered everything terrible and are numbed as regards the future, such as those who are actually being crucified” (quoted by Power & Dalgleish, 2008, p. 35). Aristotle emphasised the impact that cognitions have on emotion. However, emotional states influence our cognitions. As discussed in Chapter 15, emo- tional states influence many cognitive processes. There has been significant progress in psychologists’ ability to predict the circumstances in which such effects will occur.

PART V Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\n714 Broadening horizons One reason why it is important to study the effects of emotional states on cognition is because such effects are often present in everyday life. For example, we have more negative thoughts about ourselves and the future when feeling sad or depressed than when happy. Finally, note that some research on emotion and cognition has been dis- cussed earlier in this book. For example, emotional states influence eye- witness memory and autobiographical memory (Chapter 8) and can impair decision-making (Chapter 13). CONSCIOUSNESS The topic of consciousness did not fare well during most of the twentieth century. John Watson, a leading behaviourist, argued strongly that the concept of “consciousness” should be eliminated from psychology. He was also scathing about the value of introspection, which involves an exam- ination and description of one’s own thoughts. Consider, however, this quotation from Watson (1920): “A good deal more can be learned about the psychology of thinking by making subjects think aloud about definite problems, than by trusting to the unscientific method of introspection.” This quotation is somewhat bizarre given that “thinking aloud” is essentially synonymous with introspection! Watson’s view was that thinking aloud is acceptable because it can simply be regarded as verbal behaviour. It is increasingly accepted that consciousness is an extremely important and fascinating (although undeniably complex!) topic. The first author remembers clearly a conversation with Endel Tulving (a leading memory researcher) in the mid-1980s. He said one criterion he used when evaluating a textbook on cognitive psychology was the amount of coverage of con- sciousness. Reference back to the fourth edition of this textbook indicated that consciousness was discussed on only 2 pages out of 525 – so that edition clearly failed the Tulving test! However, the burgeoning research on consciousness was reflected by an increase to 30 pages in the seventh edition (and even more in this edition). The role of non-conscious processes in human cognition is considered in several chapters of this book. Subliminal perception and blindsight are discussed in Chapter 2, “automatic” processes are analysed in Chapter 5, implicit learning is discussed in Chapter 6, implicit memory is dealt with in Chapter 7, and the potential importance of non-conscious processing in decision-making is discussed in Chapter 13. Such research has increased interest in studying consciousness – if some processes are conscious whereas others are non-conscious, we clearly need to identify the crucial differences between them. Finally, several concepts used by cognitive psychologists are very relevant to consciousness. Examples include many theoretical ideas about atten- tion (Chapter 5) and the central executive of Baddeley’s working memory system (Chapter 6).

In recent years, however, there has been a dramatic increase in research concerned with the relationship between cognition and emotion. Examples include research on everyday memory (Chapter 8) and decision-making (Chapter 13). Two issues are central. First, how do cognitive processes influence our emotional experience? Second, how does emotion influence cognitive processes? For example, how do different emotions influence learning and memory? In short, we consider the effects of cognition on emotion and those of emotion on cognition. Four major topics are discussed in this chapter. First, we consider how our emotional experience is influenced by our cognitive appraisals (inter- pretations) of our current situation. Second, we discuss issues relating to emotion regulation. Emotion regulation is concerned with the processes (mostly deliberate) involved in managing our emotions and so allowing us to be relatively happy and achieve our goals. Third, we consider the effects of emotion on cognition. Emotional states influence attention, memory, judgement and decision-making. Of practical and theoretical importance, each emotional state produces a dif- ferent pattern of effects. Fourth, we discuss cognitive biases (e.g., interpreting ambiguous sit- uations in a threatening way) associated with anxiety and depression. A key issue is whether cognitive biases influence the development of anxiety and depression or whether they are merely a consequence of anxiety or depression. We address this issue by considering research designed to reduce or eliminate these biases. Such research has high societal relevance.

According to Colman (2015, p. 244), emotion is “any short-term evaluative, affective, intentional, psychological state”. How do emotions differ from moods? First, emotions typically last for less time. Second, emotions are more intense than moods and so are more likely to attract our attention. Third, emotions are generally caused by a specific event (e.g., passing an examination), whereas the reason for being in a given mood is often unclear. However, there is no sharp distinction between emotions and moods; they are “parallel interacting processes” (Eldar et al., 2016, p. 16). We will often use the broader term affect which encompasses emotions and moods. Positive affect refers to positive emotions and moods whereas negative affect refers to negative emotions and moods. Valence refers to the emo- tional value (positive or negative) associated with a stimulus (e.g., person; event). Structure of emotions What is the structure of emotions? Some theorists (e.g., Izard, 2007) argue we should adopt a categorical approach, according to which there are several distinct emotions. For example, Cowen and Keltner (2017, 2018) analysed the emotional states produced by over 2,000 short videos and identified 27 different emotions (e.g., admiration; adoration; amusement; anger; calmness; envy; fear; guilt; relief; and sadness). This approach proba- bly fits your subjective experience. Other theorists prefer a dimensional approach. Barrett and Russell (1998) argued for two uncorrelated or orthogonal dimensions of misery–pleasure (valence) and arousal– sleep. In contrast, Watson and Tellegen (1985) favoured two uncorrelated dimensions of pos- itive and negative affect. In spite of their differences, both approaches refer to the same two-dimensional space (see Figure 15.1). This figure also indi- cates how we can reconcile the categori- cal and dimensional approaches. Emotions such as happy and excited fall in the top- right quadrant, contented, relaxed and calm are in the bottom-right quadrant, depressed and bored are in the bottom-left quadrant, and stressed and tense are in the top-left quadrant. There is much support for the dimen- sional approach. Watson and Tellegen (1985) analysed data from numerous studies using various self- report mood measures and found 50%–65% of the variance was accounted for by dimensions of negative and positive affect. KEY TERMS Emotion A short-lived affective state typically triggered by a specific event. Mood State resembling emotion but generally longer lasting, less intense and of unknown cause. Affect A general term referring to evaluative (positive or negative) reactions; it encompasses mood and emotion. Valence The positive or negative character of emotional experience.

The full answer is unknown, but we discuss very briefly a few key points. First, locationist theories (assuming each emotion is associated with a different brain area) used to be popular (see Lindquist et al., 2012, for a review). For example, fear was allegedly strongly associated with the amygdala, disgust with the insula, anger with the orbitofrontal cortex and sadness with the anterior cingulate. However, Lindquist et al. found minimal support for the locationist approach in a meta-analytic review. Instead, it is now generally accepted that most emotions are associated with the same (or similar) large-scale brain networks (Pessoa, 2017). Second, support for the importance of large-scale networks to emo- tional experience was reported by Lindquist et al. (2016). They carried out a meta-analysis (see Glossary) of studies focusing on brain regions associated with positive and negative affect. Very similar brain areas were activated to emotionally positive and negative stimuli (see Figure 15.2). Brain areas common to positive and negative stimuli included the anterior insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, thalamus and occipito-temporal cortex. Of theoretical importance, these findings suggest the same high-arousal brain networks are associated with positive and negative affect. Third, our ability to move beyond broad dimensions such as arousal and valence depends largely on various cognitive processes. For example, Lindquist et al. (2012) found brain areas associated with attentional Figure 15.2 The top and middle rows show brain areas more activated by positive than neutral stimuli (illustrated in purple) and negative than neutral stimuli (illustrated in green); the bottom row shows areas more activated by both positive and negative stimuli than neutral ones (illustrated in orange).

Lindquist et al. (2014) showed the importance of language to emotion. They studied patients with semantic dementia (a condition involving sub- stantial impairments of concept knowledge; see Glossary). These patients viewed photographs of faces showing anger, sadness, fear, disgust, happi- ness or a neutral expression, and sorted them into meaningful piles. They distinguished clearly between positive and negative emotions but showed poor discrimination between the negative emotions. Bottom-up and top-down processes Emotional experience depends on bottom-up (or stimulus-driven) processes involving attention and perception. It also depends on top-down processes involving appraisal of the situation (see below, pp. 719–723), drawing on stored knowledge of situations similar to the present one. We can see the differences between these two kinds of processes in a study by Ochsner et al. (2009) using brain imaging. In the bottom-up condition, participants were presented with aversive photographs and told to respond naturally to the images. In the top-down condition, participants interpreted neutral photo- graphs as if they were aversive. What did Ochsner et al. (2009) find? The answer is shown in Figure 15.3. In the bottom-up condition, brain areas in the occipital, tem- poral and parietal lobes associated with visual perceptual processing were activated. There was also high activation within the amygdala (a structure Figure 15.3 Brain areas showing greater activity for top-down than for bottom-up processing (shades of blue) and those showing greater activity for bottom-up than for top- down processes (shades of yellow and red).

Somewhat different brain areas were activated in the top-down condi- tion. Top-down processing involved the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex (areas associated with high-level cognitive processes) and the ante- rior cingulate and amygdala were also activated. Self-reported negative affect was associated most strongly with activation of the medial prefron- tal cortex (associated with producing cognitive representations of stimulus meaning). Inhibitory control is an important top-down process in human cog- nition (see Chapter 6). Individuals with good inhibitory control showed smaller increases in anger and anxiety than those with poor control when those emotions were induced (Tang & Schmeichel, 2014). Thus, inhibitory control influences the experience of negative emotional states. In sum, there are substantial differences between bottom-up and top- down processes in emotion. Appraisal and emotion regulation theories (see below, pp. 723–730) emphasise the role of top-down processes in emotional experience. However, we must not neglect bottom-up processes. Note the distinction between bottom-up or relatively “automatic” processes and top-down or effortful processes is oversimplified. Emotional experience may also depend on intermediate processes (neither entirely automatic nor effortful) (Viviani, 2013). APPRAISAL THEORIES Cognitive processes (especially cognitive appraisal of the situation) influ- ence when we experience emotional states and what emotional state we experience. Appraisal theories assume “emotional responses are elicited as the organism evaluates the relevance of environmental changes for its well-being” (Brosch, 2013, p. 370). Most appraisal theories assume each emotion is elicited by its own specific appraisal pattern. For example, Scherer and Ellsworth (2009) identified appraisal profiles for major emotions. For example, you experi- ence anger if you blame someone else for the current situation and you appraise it as offering you control and power. In contrast, you experience sadness if you appraise the situation as one permitting very little control or power. C. Smith and Kirby (e.g., 2009) distinguished between appraisal involving deliberate conscious processing and appraisal involving auto- matic processes and based on activation of memories. The former is slower and more flexible. Smith and Lane (2015) developed this idea by proposing multiple appraisal mechanisms (see Figure 15.4). Fast appraisal mechanisms start 100 ms after stimulus presentation and respond to its novelty and concern relevance (i.e., relevance to the individual’s concerns). Slower appraisal mechanisms process information about goal congruence, agency and norm or value compatibility. Finally, there is a situational appraisal. Appraisal theories typically assume appraisal is the key determinant of emotional states. They also assume appraisal leads to other components of emotion (e.g., bodily sensations; action tendencies).

Participants from 27 countries indicated, for various emotion words, the probability that various features of appraisal and other components of emotion would apply to someone experiencing each emotion. Emotions were correctly classified solely from appraisal features in 71% of cases. The other components of emotion (e.g., bodily sensations; motor expressions; action tendencies) improved classification accuracy only slightly. Tong (2015) asked participants to recall an experience of 13 differ- ent positive emotions (e.g., amusement; contentment; hope; pride) and to provide appraisals for each experience. The correct positive emotion was identified from these appraisals 42% of the time (chance = 7.7%). Much research has used scenarios with participants identifying with the central character. Here is an example from Smith and Lazarus (1993). A student performed poorly in an examination and then appraised the situation. Participants indicated he would experience anger if he blamed the unhelpful teaching assistant but guilt if he blamed himself (e.g., for doing work at the last minute). Appraisal manipulations generally had the predicted effects on emotion ratings. However, manipulated appraisals accounted for less than 30% of the variance in emotion ratings (Parkinson, 2001). There are substantial individual differences in cognitive appraisal of emotional events (Kuppens, 2013). Kuppens et al. (2003) studied four appraisals (goal obstacle; other accountability: someone else is to blame; unfairness; and control) relevant to anger. No appraisal component was Figure 15.4 Multiple appraisal mechanisms used in emotion generation.

Tong (2010) studied four negative emotions (anger; sadness; fear; and guilt). No single appraisal (or combination of appraisals) was necessary or sufficient for the experience of any emotional state. Participants are typically presented with hypothetical scenarios and so experience little actual emotion. Bennett and Lowe (2008) rectified this by asking nurses to identify their most stressful recent work-related incident. Anger and frustration were the emotions most strongly experienced and these emotional reactions were predicted reasonably well by the nurses’ appraisals of the stressful situation. Most research reports associations or correlations between cognitive appraisals and emotional states and so cannot shed direct light on causal- ity. We can decide whether appraisals help to cause emotional states by manipulating people’s cognitive appraisals when confronted by emotional stimuli. Schartau et al. (2009) had participants watch films of humans and animals experiencing marked distress. Some participants received training in positive cognitive appraisal (e.g., “silver lining: there are usually some good aspects to every situation” (p. 19)). This training reduced horror, dis- tress and physiological arousal indexed by the galvanic skin response (see Figure 15.5). Similar research has focused on interpretive bias (interpreting ambigu- ous situations as threatening). The existence of interpretive bias in anxious individuals suggests their appraisals are unduly negative. We could show such appraisals influence emotional reactions by using training to reduce interpretive bias (interpretive bias modification). As predicted, reductions in experienced anxiety generally follow such training (Liu et al., 2017; dis- cussed later, p. 762). Figure 15.5 Changes in self-reported horror and distress and in galvanic skin response (GSR) between pre- training and post-training for individuals instructed to simply watch the films (watch condition) and those training in positive cognitive appraisal (appraisal condition).

According to the James-Lange theory of emotion (James, 1890), our awareness of our own bodily states influences experienced emotion. The theory predicts those who have had Botox (which often paralyses the muscles involved in facial expression) should have reduced emotional experi ence. Davis et al. (2010) obtained support for this prediction using positive and negative video clips. According to the James-Lange theory, each emotion has its own specific pattern of physiological activity. Which emotion we experience in any given situation depends importantly on our awareness of the current pattern of physiological activity. Thus, patients with spinal cord injury (who have dra- matically reduced awareness of their own bodily activity) should have very weak emotional experience. In fact, most such patients report experiencing as much emotion as healthy controls (Deady et al., 2010). Siegel et al. (2018) carried out a meta-analysis of studies focusing on the autonomic nervous system activity associated with each emotion. They failed to support the James-Lange theory because each emotion did not have its own “fingerprint” (autonomic nervous system pattern). In sum, the emotions we experience probably depend far more on situational appraisal than on feedback from physiological activity. Findings: non-conscious emotional processing Much evidence suggests emotional reactions can depend on non-conscious processes. Winkielman et al. (2005) presented happy and angry faces sub- liminally (below the conscious level) to thirsty participants. Those presented with subliminal happy faces poured and drank twice as much liquid as those presented with subliminal angry faces. In another experiment, thirsty participants paid an average of 38 cents for a drink after being presented with happy faces but only 10 cents following angry faces. Thus, affective reactions can be unconscious. In Chapter 2, we discussed patients with blindsight (see Glossary). Several of these patients show affective blindsight – emotional stimuli are discriminated in the absence of conscious perception of those stimuli. Tamietto et al. (2009) presented two blindsight patients with pictures of facial or bodily expressions of fear or happiness to their intact or blind visual field. The zygomaticus major muscle (involved in smiling) was activated more by happy expressions whereas the corrugator supercilli (involved in frowning) was activated more by fearful expressions whether or not the expressions were consciously perceived. Of importance, these facial reactions occurred 200–300 ms faster for non-consciously perceived expressions, probably because this emotional processing largely bypasses the cortex. Diano et al. (2017) reviewed research on conscious and non-conscious emotion processing. There are two routes between presentation of an emo- tional stimulus and activation of the amygdala (a brain area of central importance in emotion): (1) Processing typically involves a cortical route with emotional stimuli being consciously perceived.

Evaluation Appraisal processes influence whether we experience emotion and which emotion we experience. Individual differences in emotional experience occur in part because appraisals vary across individuals. Evidence supports the proposed distinction between conscious and “automatic” appraisal pro- cesses. Evidence based on manipulating cognitive appraisals suggests they causally influence emotion. Most evidence suggests that situational apprais- als are more important in determining which emotion is experienced than is feedback from physiological activity. What are appraisal theory’s limitations? First, the assumption that sit- uational appraisal is always crucial in determining emotional experience is too strong. In fact, individuals’ emotional experience is only moderately well predicted by their situational appraisals because there are other deter- minants of emotional experience (e.g., awareness of one’s own bodily state). Second, most research focuses on individuals on their own responding passively to a hypothetical emotional situation. In the real world, however, most emotional experiences occur in social settings and our emotional reactions depend on the reactions of others (Parkinson & Manstead, 2015). Third, appraisal theorists assume a clear-cut distinction between cog- nition and emotion. However, appraisals and emotional experiences often blur into each other (McEachrane, 2009). Fourth, most research has used relatively unambiguous situations pro- ducing a single emotion. In real life, however, we often experience mixed emotions (e.g., nostalgia combines wonderful memories with sadness for what has been lost) (Frijda, 2013). Fifth, appraisal theories typically focus on appraisals of the current situation. However, appraisals can also relate to the past and/or future. For example, part of the anger experienced by one person towards another person may be caused by appraisals relating to that person’s past behav- iour and concerns whether they will make amends in the future (Parkinson, 2011). Sixth, the impact of appraisals on other components of emotion is more flexible than assumed theoretically. For example, individuals produc- ing the same appraisal in a given situation may nevertheless differ in their physiological responding and behaviour because of their past experiences and personality (Kuppens, 2013). EMOTION REGULATION So far we have considered what happens when an individual encounters a situation and responds to it with an emotional experience. This is emotion generation (a spontaneous emotional response to the current situation). In the real world, matters are often more complex. For example, an author- ity figure makes you angry by saying something unpleasant. You decide (wisely!) to inhibit your anger and pretend all is well. This illustrates a KEY TERM Emotion generation The immediate and spontaneous emotional response to a given situation; see emotion regulation.

The above example involves emotion regulation. Emotion regulation is “the activation of a goal to modify which emotion one has, when one has the emotion, or how one experiences or expresses the emotion” (Ghafur et al., 2018, p. 31). Thus, emotion regulation occurs when an individual overrides their initial, spontaneous emotional response. We can compare emotion generation and emotion regulation in the laboratory. For example, two groups of participants experience the same emotional situation. One group is instructed to react naturally (emotion generation). The other group is told to regulate their emotional responses using a specified strategy (emotion regulation). Emotional responding (e.g., self-reported emotion; brain activation) in the two conditions is then compared. The distinction between emotion generation and emotion regulation is often blurred. For example, emotional-generation processes often lead to behaviour that changes the situation and thus the emotional response. More generally, the notion of emotion generation implies unrealistically that our emotional experiences are often unregulated and that emotions occur as passive reactions to appraisals (Parkinson, 2015). Suppose you see several very unpleasant pictures. You can simply watch them or use the emotion-regulation strategy of reappraisal (reinterpreting the meaning of the pictures to reduce negative emotions). Since reappraisal is generally effective, it seems very likely you would prefer reappraisal. In fact, when such a study was carried out (Suri et al., 2015), reappraisal was used only 16% of the time. Thus, most individuals are not fully aware of the potential benefits of emotion regulation. Process model A process model of emotion regulation put forward by Gross and Thompson (2007) has been very influential. In Figure 15.6, the basic pro- cesses involved in emotion generation are shown along the horizontal line. Of importance, it is assumed emotional intensity generally increases over time as we move from left to right. Figure 15.6 also incorporates the crucial assumption that emotion- regulation strategies can alter the emotion-generation process at various points in time (indicated by the arrows). For example, a socially anxious person could reduce anxiety in the following ways: (i) avoiding potentially stressful social situations (situation selection); (ii) asking a friend to accompany them (situation modification); (iii) focusing on distracting thoughts (attention deployment); (iv) telling themselves that most people are friendly (cognitive change); (v) inhibit the behavioural expression of anxiety (response modulation). It is unclear in the above process model how emotion-regulation strategies start and stop. Accordingly, Gross (2015) proposed the extended process model of emotion regulation, which identifies three stages of emotion regulation: KEY TERM Emotion regulation The use of explicit (deliberate and effortful) processes or implicit (relatively automatic) processes to change the spontaneous emotional state (usually a negative one) produced by the emotion-generation process.

Reappraisal A strategy used in emotion regulation in which the individual elaborates emotional information from an event prior to changing its meaning. (1) identification (deciding whether to regulate); (2) selection (deciding which strategy to select); (3) implementing (making use of a given strategy). In the original process model, the emphasis was on a linear sequence of pro- cesses starting with situation selection and ending with response modulation. In the extended model, the processes are arranged in a circular format – this makes it clear that response modulation can influence situation selection and so set off a new chain of processes. Most emotion-regulation strategies involve the attentional deployment stage (e.g., distraction – disengaging attention from emotional processing) or the cognitive change stage (e.g., reappraisal – elaborating emotional information and then changing its meaning). Sheppes et al. (2014) con- sidered when distraction and reappraisal are most likely to be used. They assumed the emotional intensity of an event generally increases over time if not subject to emotion regulation. Distraction is less cognitively demand- ing than reappraisal and can be used early to control negative emotion and “nip it in the bud”. Reappraisal is more cognitively demanding but can produce long-lasting benefits. Sheppes et al. (2014) used the above analysis to make two predictions (both supported by research). First, distraction will be preferred to reap- praisal in high negative intensity situations because it blocks emotional information before it intensifies. Second, reappraisal will be used more often with emotional stimuli encountered frequently than those encoun- tered only once – reappraisal of repeated stimuli reduces their subsequent emotional impact. So far we have considered controlled conscious processes (explicit emotion regulation). In contrast, implicit emotion regulation “is character- ised by the absence of an explicit instruction, is evoked automatically by the stimulus itself, runs to completion without conscious monitoring, and can happen without insight and awareness” (Etkin et al., 2015, p. 694). Using an explicit-regulation strategy repeatedly often leads to the devel- opment of implicit processes (Braunstein et al., 2017). Implicit regulation has the advantage over explicit regulation that it is less costly in its use of cognitive resources. How do implicit processes support emotion regulation? Koole et al. (2015) put forward three answers. First, implicit processes can help Figure 15.6 A process model of emotion regulation based on five major types of strategy (situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, cognitive change and response modulation).

Second, they can simplify the selection of appropriate emotion-regulation strategies. Third, they may facilitate the execution of such strategies. Findings: behavioural Which are the most effective emotion-regulation strategies? In a meta- analysis, Augustine and Hemenover (2009) distinguished between cognitive strategies (involving thinking) and behavioural strategies (involving physical action). In general, cognitive strategies (especially reappraisal and distrac- tion) were more effective. Webb et al. (2012) carried out the most thorough meta-analysis of the effectiveness of different emotion-regulation strategies making use of the process model shown in Figure 15.6. Overall, strategies involving cogni- tive change had a moderately beneficial effect on emotion, those involving response modulation had a small effect, and strategies involving deploy- ment had a non-significant effect. Webb et al. (2012) argued that combining several different strategies in the same category is oversimplified. For example, although attentional deployment strategies overall had a non-significant effect, distraction clearly had beneficial effects. With respect to cognitive-change strategies, reappraising the emotional situation was more beneficial than reapprais- ing the emotional response. With response modulation, suppressing emo- tional expression had a moderate effect on emotion but suppressing emotional experience had no effect. In sum, what matters is the specific strategy rather than the broad category. There is an important qualification on the findings discussed so far – the effectiveness of any given emotion-regulation strategy typically varies across situations. For example, consider a study by Troy et al. (2013). They hypothesised that reappraisal would be effective in situations where stress was uncontrollable but not those where it was controllable. In the latter situations, problem-focused coping would be superior to changing one’s emotional state. Troy et al.’s (2013) findings confirmed their hypotheses. Participants with high appraisal ability were less depressed than those with low appraisal ability when high stress was uncontrollable (see Figure 15.7). However, high appraisal ability was associated with more depression when high stress was controllable. Deciding which of two emotion-regulation strategies is more “effective” can be harder than might be imagined. Troy et al. (2018) compared the emotion-regulation strategies of reappraisal (reinterpreting meaning) and acceptance (accepting one’s emotions) when participants saw sad movie clips. Reappraisal was more effective than acceptance at reducing negative emotions. However, acceptance was more effective than reappraisal at reg- ulating physiological responding and it was also less effortful. We turn now to the use of implicit processes in emotion regula- tion. Mauss et al. (2007) exposed participants to an anger-provocation experience (the experimenter was impatient and irritated). Those previ- ously encountering reappraisal-relevant words (e.g., restrains; stable) on an unrelated task experienced less anger and fewer negative emotions Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":[".","From Gross and Thompson (2007)."]}

Wang and Xuebing (2017) carried out a similar study and obtained similar findings. They also found that implicit emotion regulation affected processing within the brain approximately 170 ms after stimulus onset. Thus, implicit emotion regulation influences early processing and is proba- bly relatively “automatic”. Doré et al. (2016) argued the effectiveness of emotion regulation depends on interactions involving the individual person, the situation and the strategy being adopted. Moreover, such interactions are present at three different stages of emotion regulation: identification of an opportunity to regulate; selection of a specific regulation strategy; and implementation of that strategy (Gross, 2015). More research is needed before we can specify which strategies are most beneficial for a given person in a given situation. Findings: neuroimaging Much research on emotion regulation has focused on the relevant brain mechanisms (e.g., Braunstein et al., 2017; Etkin et al., 2015). Most effective emotion-regulation strategies involve cognitive control processes associ- ated with activation within the prefrontal cortex (especially the dorsolat- eral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). These effortful processes cause reduced activation in the amygdala (strongly implicated in emotional responding) and reduced negative affect. Lee et al. (2012) reported relevant evidence in a study on the use of reappraisal to reduce negative affect while viewing negative pictures. Individuals with the strongest links between prefrontal areas and the amyg- dala used reappraisal most effectively. Klumpp et al. (2018) found that Figure 15.7 Mean level of depression as a function of stress severity and cognitive reappraisal ability (high = - - - -; low = ––––––) when the situation was low in controllability (left-hand side) and high in controllability (right-hand side).

In a meta-analysis, Kohn et al. (2014) identified several brain areas associated with explicit emotion regulation. Their findings were consistent with a three-stage neural network model (see Figure 15.8): (1) Emotion evaluation: this network centres on the ventrolateral prefron- tal cortex (VLPFC) and is involved in initiating appraisal and signal- ling the need to regulate emotion. (2) Initiation of regulation: this network centres on the dorsolateral pre- frontal cortex (DLPFC) and is involved in processing the regulation of emotion. (3) Execution of regulation: this network regulates affective arousal by changing the emotional state. The crucial role played by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in emotion regulation received strong support from Feeser et al. (2014). Participants used reappraisal to increase or decrease their emotional reactions to negative pictures. On some trials, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; see Glossary) was used to increase the excitability of the dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex. As predicted, the use of tDCS increased self- reported emotional arousal when participants were instructed to increase their emotional reactions and decreased it when they were told to decrease their reactions. In sum, tDCS enhanced cognitive control mediated by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Braunstein et al. (2017) reviewed neuroimaging research showing the brain mechanisms associated with implicit emotion regulation differ from those associated with explicit regulation. More specifically, implicit regulation involves the ventral anterior cingulate and the ventrome- dial prefrontal cortex but not the dorsolateral or ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.

IN THE REAL WORLD: EMOTION REGULATION AND MENTAL DISORDERS Unsurprisingly, patients with anxiety disorders or major depressive disorders have difficulties in explicit emotion regulation. For example, D’Avanzato et al. (2013) found anxious and depressed patients engaged in the maladaptive emotion-regulation strategies of rumination (obsessive thinking about emotional issues) and expressive suppression (hiding or inhibiting emotional behaviour). Visted et al. (2018) confirmed these findings in a meta-analysis of studies on depressed patients. They also found that these patients made less use than healthy controls of adaptive strategies such as acceptance (accepting one’s emotions), problem solving and reappraisal. It has often been argued that flexible emotion regulation is desirable because of frequent changes in the problems we face. Patients with emotional disorders often exhibit inflexible emotion regulation which probably contributes to their emotional disturbances (Aldao et al., 2015). There is also evidence that patients with emotional disorders have difficulties with implicit emotion regulation. For example, patients with generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worry and anxiety in several life domains) have deficient implicit regulation of emotional conflict (Etkin & Schatzberg, 2011). Why are patients with emotional disorders poor at emotion regulation? Fernandez et al. (2016) discussed four reasons. First, they find it hard to identify emotions that need regulating; (2) they often fail to select an effective emotion-regulation strategy; (3) they sometimes implement the selected strategy ineffectively; and (4) they often fail to monitor the implemented strategy to decide whether a different strategy should be used. Which emotion-regulation strategies are associated with beneficial effects on anxiety and depression? In their review, Aldao et al. (2010) found acceptance, problem solving and reappraisal all reduced the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Mennin et al. (2015) argued emotion-regulation therapy might be valuable. Accordingly, they devised therapy emphasising the teaching of effective emotion-regulation strategies and encouraging patients to use these strategies when they anticipated being in a stressful situation. This therapy was used with anxious patients, half of whom also had depressive symptoms. Therapy increased patients’ use of effective emotion-regulation strategies (e.g., reappraisal) and reduced the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Renna et al. (2018) obtained similar findings. Reductions in anxious and depressive symptoms produced by emotion regulation therapy were maintained over a period of nine months post-treatment. What are the long-term effects of emotion-regulation therapy? One approach is to consider changes in brain activity resulting from therapy. Successful emotion regulation often involves increased activity in prefrontal areas (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), indicative of enhanced cognitive control, and decreased activity in limbic areas (e.g., amygdala), reflecting responsiveness to emotional stimuli. This pattern has often been found in anxious and depressed patients post- therapy (Messina et al., 2016). Evaluation Several advances have been made. First, effective emotion-regulation strat- egies often involve effortful cognitive processing in the prefrontal cortex leading to reduced amygdala activation. Second, the extended process model (Gross, 2015) is more realistic than Gross’s previous model, which was based on a linear sequence of processes, and it also identifies factors respon- sible for the initiation of emotion regulation.

Fourth, factors influencing which strategy is selected in a given situation have been identified. Fifth, there are promising signs emotion-regulation therapy is successful in treating anxiety and depression. What are the limitations of theory and research in this area? (1) There is no clear-cut distinction between emotion generation and emotion regulation. (2) Behavioural emotion-regulation strategies (e.g., drinking alcohol; arguing with others) have been de-emphasised. (3) The effectiveness of emotion regulation depends on complex (but poorly understood) interactions involving the individual, the situation and the emotion-regulation strategy selected (Doré et al., 2016). (4) We do not know why most people have limited awareness of the ben- efits of emotion-regulation strategies and often fail to use effective strategies. For example, Suri et al. (2015) found only 16% of parti- cipants used the effective strategy of reappraisal even when its use was explicitly suggested. A possible explanation is that people prefer strat- egies they have used recently and/or frequently even when such strategies are relatively ineffective in the current situation (Ghafur et al., 2018). (5) Little is known concerning individual differences in the ability to use any given strategy. However, McRae et al. (2012) made a start: indi- viduals using reappraisal successfully had above-average well-being and working memory capacity (see Glossary). AFFECT AND COGNITION: ATTENTION AND MEMORY Much laboratory research differs considerably from everyday life because individuals’ cognitive processes and performance are assessed in a relatively neutral emotional state. In real life, emotions often influence our behav- iour. Consider “road rage” (i.e., frustrated drivers become angry and so drive dangerously). Zhang and Chan (2016) reviewed studies on driving anger and driving behaviour. Driving anger was associated with aggressive driving, risky driving and driving errors. However, it was only modestly associated with near misses and accidents. Qu et al. (2016) confirmed that experiencing driving anger was a poor predictor of car crashes. However, individuals expressing anger verbally (e.g., shouting insults) and physically (e.g., making hostile gestures) were much more likely to cause car crashes. Our emotional state influences numerous aspects of cognition includ- ing perception, attention, interpretation of situations, learning, memory, judgement, decision-making and reasoning (Blanchette & Richards, 2010). We discuss research on attention and memory here and the next section focuses on judgement and decision-making. Most theories assume the effects of positive and negative affect on cog- nitive processes (e.g., attention; memory; judgement; decision-making) are fixed and constant. However, this assumption is oversimplified. Huntsinger et al. (2014) and Ray and Huntsinger (2017) argued persuasively the Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["pon- sible for the initiation of emotion regulation.","Third, emotion-regulation Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58."]}

More specif- ically, affect provides useful feedback concerning an individual’s current mental state: “Positive affective feelings act as a ‘go signal’ that promotes the use of accessible processing styles, and negative affective feelings act as a ‘stop signal’ that inhibits their use” (Ray & Huntsinger, 2017. p. 2). This is an affect-as-cognitive-feedback account. Several techniques have been used to manipulate people’s mood state (Lench et al., 2011). The most common technique (24% of studies) involves presenting emotional films. Another popular technique (20% of studies) involves autobiographical recall (e.g., describing an intense emotional experience). Attention We have flexibility in what we attend to and also the scope of focal atten- tion (see Chapter 5). Some theorists (e.g., Eriksen & St James, 1986) have compared visual attention to a zoom lens allowing the attended area to be increased or decreased. This issue is relevant to understanding long- term memory: our memory of an event is strongly influenced by what we attended to during learning. How does affect influence attentional breadth? Easterbrook (1959) provided an influential answer with respect to negative affect. He hypoth- esised the range of cues processed (i.e., the breadth of attention) decreases as arousal or anxiety increases. Thus, high negative affect produces “tunnel vision”. Easterbrook’s hypothesis enhances our understanding of eyewitness memory (see Chapter 8), because eyewitnesses are often very anxious when observing a crime. It is also relevant to the effects of anxiety on driving. Anxious drivers attend less than non-anxious ones to peripheral information (Janelle et al., 1999). Briggs et al. (2011) used a simulated driving task with spider-phobic drivers. They showed narrowing of atten- tion while driving when made anxious by having a conversation about spiders. What about the effects of positive affect on attentional breadth? According to Fredrickson and Branigan (2005, p. 315), positive emotions “widen the array of percepts, thoughts, and actions presently in mind.” Thus, positive affect produces broadening of attention rather the narrow- ing of attention assumed for negative affect by Easterbrook (1959). Gable et al. (2015a) argued we should also consider motivational inten- sity (e.g., having the goal of approaching or avoiding a stimulus). Positive affect can involve low motivational intensity (e.g., listening to music) or high motivational intensity (e.g., seeing an attractive member of the oppo- site sex). Similarly, negative affect can involve low motivational intensity (e.g., being exposed to sad situations) or high emotional intensity (e.g., being exposed to threatening situations). Gable et al. (2015a) argued positive and negative affective states of high motivational intensity produce attentional narrowing because this helps individuals to acquire desirable objects and avoid unpleasant ones. In contrast, there is attentional broadening with positive and negative Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["Huntsinger et al.","(2014) and Ray and Huntsinger (2017) argued persuasively the Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58."]}

Findings Easterbrook’s hypothesis and the theoretical viewpoint of Gable et al. (2015a) both predict that anxiety (which has high motivational intensity) should produce attentional narrowing. Relevant evidence has been obtained from several studies where participants performed a primary task presented in the centre of the visual field and a secondary task in the periphery. If anxiety causes attentional narrowing, it should impair performance on the secondary task more than the primary task. That prediction has received consistent support (Eysenck et al., 2007). Both theories predict anger (also having high motivational intensity) should produce attentional narrowing; this finding was reported by Gable et al. (2015b). The two theories differ with respect to the effects of sadness (a mood state involving low motivational intensity). According to Gable et al.’s motivational intensity theory, sadness should produce attentional broaden- ing whereas the opposite prediction follows from Easterbrook’s hypothesis. Gable and Harmon-Jones’ (2010b) findings supported motivational inten- sity theory. Fredrickson and Branigan (2005) predicted that positive affect leads to attentional broadening. Vanlessen et al. (2016) reported strong support for this prediction in their meta-analytic review. How can we explain these findings? According to Pourtois et al. (2017), positive affects leads to reduced cognitive control and so less attentional selectivity. Note that Gable et al.’s (2015a) motivational intensity theory predicts positive affect should produce attentional narrowing if there is high moti- vational intensity. This prediction (opposite to that of Fredrickson and Branigan’s theory) was supported in a study by Gable et al. (2015b). In sum, most of the findings support Gable et al.’s (2015a) theoreti- cal approach. Thus, attentional narrowing (or broadening) depends much more on whether affective states have high or low motivational intensity than on whether they are positive or negative. Huntsinger (2012) added a complication to this picture. He argued individuals generally interpret positive affect as indicating they should continue with their current process- ing strategy. In contrast, negative affect indicates they should inhibit their current processing strategy. These assumptions were incorporated into the affect-as-cognitive-feedback account mentioned earlier. In Huntsinger’s (2012) study, participants initially performed a task using a broad (global) attentional focus, a narrow or local attentional focus, or a mixture. Then they performed a different task: deciding whether a central letter was an H or S. This central letter was flanked by letters compatible or incompatible with it. It was assumed individuals with a broad attentional focus would be more influenced by flanker compatibility than those with a narrow attentional focus. As predicted, those in a happy mood had the same attentional focus as on the initial task whereas those in a sad mood had the opposite attentional focus (see Figure 15.9). The effects of mood on memory (discussed further shortly, pp. 734–738) depend in part on whether the mood narrows or broadens attention.

For Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\nCognition and emotion 733 example, emotion often increases memory for information central to our current goals but reduces it for unimportant information (Levine & Edelstein, 2009). Consider the weapon focus effect (the tendency for eyewitnesses to attend narrowly to a weapon and thus fail to remember peripheral details) reviewed by Fawcett et al. (2016) (see Chapter 8). It is tempting to link “memory narrowing” associated with emotional states to attentional narrowing during learning. However, there are prob- lems with that argument. First, visual attention at learning often fails to predict the extent of “memory narrowing” (Steinmetz et al., 2016). Second, the predicted memory narrowing is not always found. Steinmetz et al. (2016) presented positive, negative or neutral objects on neutral backgrounds. When the object cued recall of the associated background, memory for background or peripheral information was actually greater when emotional objects (positive or negative) had been presented. Thus, peripheral information is often stored in memory and emotional cues may facilitate its retrieval. Third, it follows from Gable et al.’s (2015a,b) theory that attention (and perhaps memory) depend on the motivational intensity of an emotional state. Thus, there should be memory broadening if the emotional state has low motivational intensity. Talarico et al. (2009) asked participants to recall eight emotional autobiographical memories. Peripheral details were poorly recalled with memories associated with emotions having high motivational intensity (anger; fear; negative surprise). However, sad memories were associated with reasonably good recall of peripheral mem- ories perhaps because of the low motivational intensity of that emotional state. Talarico et al. (2009) found good recall of peripheral details for all types of positive memories. This fits with Frederickson and Branigan’s (2005) theory and also fits Gable et al.’s (2015a,b) theory if we assume (perhaps mistakenly) that most positive mood states occur with low moti- vational intensity. Of relevance, Gable and Harmon-Jones (2010a) found positive affect enhanced memory for peripheral details when there was low motivational intensity but not when there was high motivational intensity.

The obtained findings depend mostly on the level of motivational intensity. The notion (Huntsinger et al., 2014) that positive affect leads individuals to maintain their previous cognitive processes whereas negative affect causes them to change those processes has received support. There is strong support for two conclusions. First, positive and neg- ative affect typically have significant influences on attentional processes. Second, “Affective influences on cognition are . . . not fixed but mallea- ble [flexible]” (Clore et al., 2018, p. 78). We probably benefit from this attentional flexibility rather than having our attentional processes inflexibly determined by our current emotional state. Memory How does emotion influence long-term memory? Emotional events are for- gotten more slowly than neutral ones (especially those that produce nega- tive rather than positive affect: Bowen et al., 2018). As a result, the memory advantage for emotional events generally increases over time (Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015). Evidence that emotional events are often better remem- bered than neutral ones comes from research on flashbulb memories (vivid memories of dramatic events such as 9/11; see Chapter 8). Flashbulb mem- ories are especially long-lasting when there is an initial intense emotional experience. For example, those near the World Trade Centre when it was destroyed had more vivid memories of that event than those further away (Sharot et al., 2007). Brain mechanisms: amygdala The effects of mood or emotion on long-term memory depend on activa- tion within several brain regions. Of central importance is the amygdala (see Glossary), which is associated with several emotions. Researchers often refer to the amygdala but note that it consists of at least three com- ponent parts (Hortensius et al., 2017) and so is more complex than usually assumed. Emotion’s memory-enhancing effects depend in part on amygdala acti- vation (Dolcos et al., 2017). Tambini et al. (2017) even found participants showed enhanced long-term memory for neutral items presented up to 30 minutes following the processing of emotionally arousing stimuli. This occurred because the emotionally arousing stimuli produced long-lasting activation within the amygdala and related brain areas. Adolphs et al. (2005) found healthy controls showed enhanced memory for gist when the encoding context was emotional rather than neutral. In contrast, patients with amygdala damage showed a specific impairment limited to gist memory with an emotional context at encoding, but such damage was not associated with impaired memory for background details. These findings suggest the amygdala is required for focused attention on Case study: Hills et al.

We can also assess the role of the amygdala in influencing the effects of emotion on memory by studying patients with Urbach-Wiethe disease, in which the amygdala and nearby areas are largely or totally destroyed (see Feinstein, 2013, for a review). Cahill et al. (1995) found a patient (BP) had poorer recall of a very emotional story event than of an emotionally neutral event. In contrast, healthy controls had much better recall of the emotional event. Similarly, Siebert et al. (2003) found Urbach-Wiethe patients had greater memory impairment for emotional pictures than neutral ones. It is often assumed amygdala activation facilitates the storage of emo- tional memories in long-term memory via a physiologically based process of consolidation (see Glossary). This theory implies healthy individuals would have superior long-term memory for all the information associated with an emotional event. In fact, that is not the case. Sharot and Yonelinas (2008) found negative pictures were remembered better than neutral ones 24 hours after learning. However, emotion did not influence contextual information (i.e., whether the pictures had been presented in the context of a colour or complexity task). A major reason why the amygdala is of importance in explaining the enhancing effects of mood on memory is because it is a hub having numer- ous connections to 90% of cortical regions and it is involved in various brain networks. Supporting evidence was reported by Murty et al. (2010) in a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. Good long-term memory for emotional material was associated with greater activation during learning in a network including the amygdala, the hippocampus and the medial pre- frontal cortex. Dolcos et al. (2017) provided a comprehensive account of the brain networks concerned with emotion’s memory-enhancing effects (see Figure 15.10). They identified two brain mechanisms.

Second, there is a top-down mechanism, which includes several areas within the prefrontal cortex and is involved in various cognitive processes (e.g., attention; working memory; and cognitive control). Of importance, the amygdala is involved in both mechanisms. Mood congruity Affect influences learning and memory in various ways. What memories would spring to mind if you were in a negative mood because of personal problems? People generally recall mostly negative or unpleasant memories in such circumstances. In contrast, we typically recall happy memories when in a good mood. These examples illustrate mood congruity – emotionally toned material is learned and retrieved best when its affective value matches the learner’s (or rememberer’s) mood state. There is much evidence for mood-congruent memory. For example, depressed individuals recall more negative information than positive or neutral information (e.g., Rinck & Becker, 2005; discussed later, p. 759). Holland and Kensinger (2010) reviewed research on mood and autobio- graphical memory. Positive mood was associated with strong evidence of mood congruity. However, mood congruity was less apparent with negative mood. Similar findings have been found in studies using non- autobiographical material (Rusting & DeHart, 2000). Many failures of mood congruity in a negative mood state occur because individuals in that mood state are motivated to enhance their mood state. Rusting and DeHart (2000) used a negative mood induc- tion and found participants claiming they could successfully reduce their negative moods showed less evidence of mood congruity than other participants. How can we explain mood congruity? Tulving’s (1979) encoding specificity principle (Chapter 6) is applicable. According to this princi- ple, memory depends on the overlap between the information available at retrieval and that in the memory trace. This overlap is greater when the to-be-remembered material is congruent with the rememberer’s mood state. Lewis et al. (2005) extended the encoding specificity principle, arguing that brain activation at learning and at retrieval would be more alike in conditions producing mood congruity. As predicted, one brain region (the subgenual cingulate) was activated when positive stimuli were presented and was reactivated when participants were in a positive mood at test. A different brain region (the posteriolateral orbitofrontal cortex) was acti- vated when negative stimuli were presented and was reactivated when par- ticipants’ mood at test was negative. Mood-state-dependent memory Another effect of mood on memory is mood-state-dependent memory: memory is better when an individual’s mood state at retrieval matches (rather than mismatches) that at learning. In a review, Ucros (1989) found KEY TERMS Mood congruity Learning and memory of emotional material are better when the learner’s/ rememberer’s mood state matches the affective value of the material than when it does not. Mood-state-dependent memory Memory performance is better when the individual’s mood state is the same at learning and retrieval than when it differs.

This probably occurred because individuals experiencing a negative mood state are motivated to change their mood state into a positive one. We can clarify the processes underly- ing mood-state-dependent memory effects by considering a study by Kenealy (1997). Participants viewed a map and learned a given route. The next day they received tests of free recall (no cues) and cued recall (the map’s visual outline). Happy or sad mood states were created at learning and test. Mood-state-dependent memory was found in free recall but not cued recall (see Figure 15.11). The free recall findings can be explained with reference to the encoding specificity prin- ciple (discussed above, p. 736). If information about mood state is stored during learning, the overlap between retrieval information and information in the memory trace will be greater when the mood state is the same at learning and test. How can we explain the absence of mood-state-dependent memory with cued recall? Eich (1995) argued mood state has less influence when crucial information is presented explicitly at retrieval, as happens with cued recall. He discussed a “do-it-your- self principle” – memory is most likely to be mood-dependent when effortful processing at learning and/or retrieval is required. Support for the “do-it-yourself principle” was obtained by Eich and Metcalfe (1989). At learning, participants were assigned to read (e.g., river-valley) or generate (e.g., river-v_____) conditions. In the generate con- dition, they completed the second word in each pair during learning which involved effortful processing. The mood-state-dependent effect was four times greater in the generate condition. Evaluation Several effects of mood state on attention and memory have been estab- lished. Mood states involving high motivational intensity typically produce attentional narrowing, whereas mood states involving low motivational intensity produce attentional broadening. These effects on attention influ- ence long-term memory. Positive affect often leads individuals to main- tain their current attentional strategy, whereas negative affect leads them to change that strategy. There is much evidence for mood congruity and Figure 15.11 (a) Free and (b) cued recall as a function of mood state (happy or sad) at learning and at recall. Based on data in Kenealy (1997).

Finally, we have an increasingly detailed understanding of the brain networks associated with the memory- enhancing effects of emotion. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, the notion that attentional narrowing or broadening has direct effects on long-term memory is only partially correct. Second, there is less evidence for mood congruity and mood-state-dependent memory with negative mood states than positive ones. Third, the reasons why stronger mood-state memory effects are found with some memory tasks than others are not fully understood. AFFECT AND COGNITION: JUDGEMENT AND DECISION-MAKING Judgement and decision-making are discussed in Chapter 13. Decision- making involves choosing among various options varying between the trivial (e.g., what am I going to drink?) and the hugely important (e.g., which career path will I follow?). Judgement is an important compo- nent of decision-making. It involves assessing the probability of various events occurring and then deciding how we would feel if each one happened. This section is concerned with the effects of affect on judgement and decision- making. This is an important area of research. As Lerner et al. (2015, p. 801) pointed out, “Many psychological scientists assume that emotions are . . . the dominant driver of most meaning- ful decisions in life.” Below we start by con- sidering how emotions influence what, in the real world, are life-and-death issues. Moral dilemma: emotion vs cognition (reason) It is commonly believed emotion leads us to make fast relatively “automatic” decisions whereas cognition (reason) produces slower, more considered decisions. For example, consider Greene et al.’s (2008) dual-process model of decisions made with moral dilem- mas. They distinguished between two systems: (1) a fast, automatic and affective system; and (2) a slower, effortful and more “cognitive” system. This model has been investigated using various moral dilemmas. For example, the trolley problem poses a moral dilemma. You must decide whether to divert a runaway trolley threatening the lives of five people Figure 15.12 Two well-known moral dilemma problems: (a) the trolley problem; and (b) the footbridge problem.

The footbridge problem also poses a moral dilemma. You must decide whether to push a fat person over a bridge causing that person’s death but saving five people’s lives (see Figure 15.12b). What did you decide? Research indicates 90% of people decide to divert the trolley (trolley problem) but only 10% decide to push the person off the footbridge (footbridge problem). Greene et al. (2008) argued the footbridge problem is a personal moral dilemma because we might directly harm one or more individuals through our actions. In contrast, the trolley problem is an impersonal dilemma because any harm is only indirectly due to our actions. With personal moral dilemmas, those making deontological judge- ments based on moral rules or obligations (e.g., do not kill) respond mainly based on the first, affective system. Deontological judgements are very common with the footbridge dilemma. In contrast, those making practi- cal or utilitarian judgements based on maximising the consequences (e.g., saving as many lives as possible) use the second, cognitive system. Utilitarian judgements are very common with the trolley problem. In crude terms, you can use your heart (deontological judgements) or your head (utilitarian judgements) to resolve moral dilemmas (Greene, 2014). Different brain areas are associated with the two systems (see Figure 15.13). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA9/46) is involved in cognitive control. In contrast, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC; BA10/11) is involved in emotion generation. Findings According to the dual-process model, individuals making utilitarian judge- ments should have more activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than those making deontological judgements. This finding was reported by Greene et al. (2004). Tassy et al. (2012) applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stim- ulation (rTMS; see Glossary) to the DLPFC to inhibit its functioning. This reduced utili- tarian judgements with moral dilemmas of high emotional intensity. Patients with damage to the ventrome- dial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) have reduced emotional responsiveness and so should be less influenced than healthy controls by emo- tional factors. As predicted, they make more utilitarian judgements than controls (Thomas et al., 2011). It is assumed theoretically that deonto- logical judgements depend much more on emotional processing than utilitarian ones only with personal moral dilemmas. Perkins et al. (2013) gave an anti-anxiety drug to par- ticipants to reduce the impact of emotion on judgements. As predicted, anti-anxiety drugs Figure 15.13 The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is located approximately in Brodmann areas 9 and 46; the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is located approximately in Brodmann areas 10 and 11.

According to Greene’s theoretical approach, utilitarian judgements are regarded as reflecting concern for the greater good. However, Kahane et al. (2015) obtained evidence apparently inconsistent with that approach. They found antisocial individuals (e.g., those with psychopathic tendencies) were more likely to produce utilitarian judgements with personal moral dilem- mas than were other people. Conway et al. (2018) replicated the above findings when participants were forced to choose between utilitarian and deontological judgements. However, they pointed out that such findings are ambiguous – they may reflect increased utilitarian inclinations in antisocial individuals and/or reduced deontological inclinations. When they used more sen- sitive measures, Conway et al. discovered antisocial individuals had reduced deontological inclinations rather than increased utilitarian incli- nations. These findings are broadly consistent with Greene’s theoretical approach. Consequences (C), moral norms (N) and preference for inaction (I): CNI model Gawronski and Beer (2017) also argued that forcing participants to decide between utilitarian and deontological judgements provides ambig- uous information. Accepting the killing of one person to save the lives of five other people on the trolley dilemma may reflect a utilitarian moral judgement. However, it could also indicate a lack of aversion to harming others. Deciding not to push the person off the footbridge on the footbridge problem may indicate either a deontological moral judgement or a general preference for inaction regardless of any moral norms. Gawronski et al. (2017) argued we can resolve such ambiguities by manipulating factors relevant to utilitarian judgements (i.e., changing out- comes or consequences) and those relevant to deontological judgements (i.e., changing moral norms). In addition, individual preferences for inac- tion or action can be assessed by including problems where moral norms prohibit action (e.g., using illegal torture methods to discover where chil- dren have been hidden). Accordingly, Gawronski et al. obtained separate measures of sensitivity to consequences or outcomes (utilitarian judge- ments) and to moral norms (deontological judgements), and a general pref- erence for inaction vs action. Gawronski et al. (2017) compared individuals high and low in psy- chopathy (antisocial tendencies). Those high in psychopathy had a greater preference than low scorers for action over inaction (see Figure 15.14). However, they had less sensitivity than low scorers to consequences and to moral norms. These findings seem more plausible than previous reports (e.g., Kahane et al., 2015) that high psychopathy is associated with an emphasis on utilitarian moral judgements.

From Gawronski et al. (2017). IN THE REAL WORLD: DRIVERLESS CARS The prospect that our roads may soon be full of driverless cars raises important moral issues. Approximately 75% of people argue driverless cars should be programmed to sacrifice one passenger rather than kill ten pedestrians (Bonnefon et al., 2016). This is a utilitarian moral decision. However, Bonnefon et al. (2016) found complex moral issues arose when they asked additional questions. Support for the utilitarian judgement (morality of sacrifice) was lower when people imagined they were in the driverless car alone, or with a co-worker or family member (see Figure 15.15). If you want to compare your moral decisions in such dilemmas, you can do so at the following address: http://moralmachine.mit.edu. When deciding how likely they would be to buy a driverless car designed to minimise casualties (which might threaten their own lives) or one programmed to protect the passengers, their enthusiasm for the utilitarian approach was weak. As Bonnefon et al. concluded, “Although people tend to agree that everyone would be better off if [driverless cars] were utilitarian (in the sense of minimising casualties), these same people have a personal incentive to ride in [driverless cars] that will protect them at all costs” (p. 1575). The moral issues involved in programming driverless cars have often been compared to those involved in the trolley problem (discussed earlier, pp. 738–739). However, there are important differences (Nyholm, 2018). First, the outcomes of the possible decision choices are known with certainty with the trolley problem but are much less clear-cut when considering most road- driving conditions. For example, if a driverless car is programmed to mount the pavement where pedestrians are walking, the harm that would be caused depends on numerous factors (e.g., whether the pedestrians are looking at the car; the mobility of the pedestrians). Second, there are complexities associated with real-world driving absent from the trolley problem (Nyholm, 2018). For example, it could be argued that driverless cars should be programmed to 1.0 Low psychopathy High psychopathy 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 C parameter Parameter estimate N parameter I parameter Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["gh psychopathy is associated with an emphasis on utilitarian moral judgements.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58."]}

Third, suppose that in the future driverless cars are much safer than cars driven by humans. Should the driverless cars be programmed to minimise lives lost (the utilitarian judgement)? The “natural” reaction is to answer “Yes”. However, the problem with that approach is that people would be reluctant to buy cars that would not prioritise their own safety in the case of an accident. Thus, programming driverless cars to use utilitarian judgements is generally regarded as morally desirable. However, it would have the unfortunate consequence that fewer driverless cars would be bought. As a result, more people would die in car accidents using this morally desirable approach because fewer of the safe driverless cars would be bought!

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\nCognition and emotion 743 What are the dual-process model’s limitations? First, it is oversimpli- fied (as are the moral dilemmas typically used to test it). As Gawronski et al. (2017, p. 21) pointed out, “The traditional [experimental] approach conflates sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to norms, and general pref- erences for inaction in a single outcome measures.” In addition, the out- comes of the decision choices on the trolley and footbridge problems are known with certainty but this is generally not the case in the real world. Second, little is known of the extent to which responses to hypothetical dilemmas predict responses to real-life dilemmas. Bostyn et al. (2018) found that judgements in a real-life dilemma (administering an electric shock to one mouse vs allowing five other mice to receive the shock) were not pre- dicted by judgements on hypothetical trolley-like problems. One possibility is that people are more likely to make what they regard as socially desira- ble judgements in hypothetical situations. Third, according to the dual-process model, the processes underlying deontological judgements occur more rapidly and with less effort than those underlying utilitarian judgements. However, Bialek and De Neys (2017) found that participants making deontological judgements often pro- cessed information relevant to utilitarian judgements rapidly and in parallel with information relevant to deontological judgements. Thus, the processes underlying moral judgements are often more complex than assumed by Greene’s model. Judgement and decision-making: anxiety, sadness, anger and positive mood There has recently been a dramatic increase in research considering the impact of affect on judgement and decision-making. As discussed earlier, there are numerous emotions and mood states. However, research has focused mostly on four mood states (anxiety; sadness; anger; positive mood) and our coverage will reflect that focus. Angie et al. (2011) provided a research review of this area. They drew two general conclusions. First, major mood states have different effects on judgement and decision-making. Second, moods influence decision-making more than judgement. We will also consider the effects of personality on judgement and decision-making because there are moderately strong links between person- ality and mood. For example, individuals high in the personality dimen- sion of trait anxiety (see Glossary) are in an anxious mood state much more often than those low in trait anxiety. What predictions might we make? First, we might expect mood valence (positive vs negative) to be important. More specifically, individuals experi- encing negative moods (e.g., fear; anger; sadness) should be pessimistic and risk-averse, whereas those experiencing positive moods should be optimis- tic and willing to take risks. Second, we might expect any given mood state to be associated with risky or cautious decision-making regardless of the situation or the nature of the decision. As we will see, both assumptions are only partially correct. Lerner et al. (2015, p. 801) provided a useful overarching principle to explain the effects of emotions on decision-making: “Decisions can be Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["of relevance to many real-life situations (e.g., programming driverless cars).","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58."]}

Integral emotions arise from the current judgement or choice. For example, an individual deciding whether or not to gamble a lot of money on a risky project may experience anxiety. In contrast, incidental emotions are unrelated to the current task (judgement or decision-making). For example, the positive affect you experience having passed an important examination may influence your subsequent judgements and decisions on totally different issues. Much research has involved incidental emotions. For example, par- ticipants describe an intensely emotional experience and then perform an unrelated task. In contrast, real-world judgement and decision-making very often involve integral emotions (e.g., the emotions associated with the choices available when making a crucial decision often influence our decision). Why is it important to distinguish between integral and inciden- tal emotions? One reason is that the effects of incidental emotion on judgement and decision-making are often weaker than those of integral emotion. For example, individuals high in emotional intelligence (including the ability to understand emotions) are better able to identify the event causing their emotions and so minimise the impact of incidental emotions on decision-making (Yip & Côté, 2013). The effects of incidental emotion on judgement are sometimes easy to eliminate. Schwarz and Clore (1983) studied the effects of mood produced by weather conditions on ratings of life satisfaction. These ratings were lower on rainy than sunny days because the weather influenced people’s mood. However, the negative effect of bad weather on judged life satisfaction dis- appeared when people were led to attribute their bad mood to the weather. Anxiety Fear or anxiety is consistently associated with pessimistic judgements about the future. Lerner et al. (2003) carried out a study soon after the 9/11 terror- ist attacks. Participants focused on aspects of the attacks that made them afraid, angry or sad. The estimated probability of future terrorist attacks was higher in fearful participants than sad or angry ones. Most individuals have an optimism bias – they believe they are more likely than others to experience positive events (e.g., career success) but less likely to experience negative events (e.g., divorce; serious illness). Anxious individuals exhibit less optimism bias than non-anxious ones. Lench and Levine (2005) asked college students to judge the likelihood of various events (positive and negative) happening to them compared to the average college student. Those put into a fearful mood were more pessimistic than those in a happy or neutral mood. Harris et al. (2008) reported similar findings. Individuals high in trait anxiety were less likely than non-anxious individuals to perceive others as more vulnerable than themselves to future risks (e.g., having a heart attack; getting divorced).

Lee et al. (2006) provided real-world evidence. High-anxious individ- uals were much less likely than low-anxious ones to die from accidental causes or suffer non-fatal injuries because they were more risk-averse. Raghunathan and Pham (1999) asked participants to decide whether to accept job A (high salary + low job security) or job B (average salary + high job security). Those in an anxious mood state were much less likely than those in a neutral state to choose the high-risk option (i.e., job A) (see Figure 15.16). Gambetti and Giusberti (2012) studied real-life financial decision-making. Anxious individuals made safer (more conservative) financial decisions. They were more likely to have put their money into interest- bearing accounts but less likely to have invested large sums in stocks and shares. Oehler et al. (2018) found that individuals with anxious personalities made less risky financial investment decisions than non-anxious ones. Charpentier et al. (2017) identified two potential reasons for find- ings such as those discussed above. First, anxious individuals may be loss averse (aversion to negative outcomes). Second, anxious individuals may be risk averse (avoiding uncertainty even when only gains are involved). Their findings provide clear-cut support for the second reason. Sadness Sadness and anxiety are both negative emotional states. However, sadness (which becomes depression when intense) is more strongly associated with an absence of positive affect (Clark & Watson, 1991; see later discus- sion, p. 755). As a result, sad individuals may be less optimistic than other people. Lench and Darbor (2014) found the perceived likelihood of risk from formaldehyde exposure was greater when participants were in a sad rather than neutral mood. Waters (2008) reviewed research concerning mood state and likelihood estimates of health hazards and life events. Sad or depressed individuals had less optimism bias than non-depressed ones. Decision-making As discussed earlier, Raghunathan and Pham (1999) found anxious individ- uals preferred a low-risk job to a high-risk one. In contrast, sad individuals chose the high-risk job (see Figure 15.16). According to Raghunathan and Figure 15.16 Effects of mood manipulation (anxiety, sadness or neutral) on percentages of people choosing a high-risk job option.

Real-life risk taking was studied by Langille et al. (2012). Depressed adolescents were much more likely than non-depressed ones to engage in multiple sexual risk-taking forms of behaviour. Perhaps depressed individ- uals feel they have “little to lose”. Drivers exhibited riskier driving behav- iour after being put into a sad mood state (Eherenfreund-Hager et al., 2017). Cryder et al. (2008) found evidence for the misery-is-not-miserly effect – sad individuals paid more than others to obtain a given commod- ity. More specifically, sad individuals (especially those high in self-focus) were willing to pay almost four times as much those in a neutral mood for a water bottle (see Figure 15.17). These findings suggest sadness increases the motivation to acquire possessions to enhance the self (especially when sad individuals focus their attention on the self). Garg et al. (2018) con- ducted a meta-analysis and reported reliable evidence for the misery-is-not- miserly effect. They also found suggestive evidence the effect is partly due to the sense of helplessness associated with sadness. Many people believe in the “sadder-but-wiser” hypothesis – sad indi- viduals make wiser decisions. Lerner et al. (2013) tested this hypothesis by assessing the extent to which individuals prefer immediate rewards to larger (but later) ones. Participants in a neutral mood required $56 imme- diately to forego receiving $85 in 3-months’ time. However, those in a sad mood required only $37 immediately. How can we explain the above findings? Lerner et al. (2013) argued they indicated myopic misery – sad individuals have a sense of loss and so are impatient to obtain rewards to replace what has been lost. Sad indi- viduals were more likely than those in a neutral mood to have impatient thoughts and to focus on what they might buy with the money while decid- ing whether to prefer an immediate or a delayed reward. In sum, depressed individuals experience a combination of high neg- ative affect and low positive affect (Clark & Watson, 1991). Depressed individuals often engage in risky decision-making because their motivation to enhance their low level of positive affect leads them to seek immediate rewards.

However, it can be expe- rienced as relatively pleasant because it leads individuals to believe they can control the situation and dominate those they dislike (and perhaps also those they like) (Lerner & Tiedens, 2006). Schadenfreude (experiencing pleasure at the misfortune of disliked others) is increased by anger (Hareli & Weiner, 2002). How does anger influence judgement? There are striking differences between the effects of anger and other negative emotional states. Anger is associated with relatively optimistic judgements about the likelihood of negative events whereas anxiety and sadness are both associated with pessi- mistic judgements (Waters, 2008). Angry individuals rate themselves as less at risk of severe negative life events (e.g., divorce; work problems; heart disease) than other people even though they are actually more likely to experience these events (Lerner & Keltner, 2001). Why is anger associated with optimistic judgements rather than the pessimistic ones associated with other negative mood states? Anger differs from other negative moods in being associated with a sense of certainty about what has happened and with perceived control over the situation (Litvak et al., 2010; discussed further later, pp. 751–752). These unique features of anger (especially high perceived control) explain why anger pro- duces optimistic judgements. Anger often causes judgements to be made using relatively shallow or heuristic processing. Ask and Granhag (2007) found angry police investi- gators processed witness statements more superficially than did sad ones. Decision-making Since angry individuals perceive themselves to have high control over sit- uations, we might expect them to make risky decisions. This prediction has received support. Lerner and Keltner (2001) used the Asian disease problem on which most people exhibit risk-averse decision-making (see Chapter 13). Fearful participants were risk-averse but angry ones were risk-seeking. In a study by Gambetti and Giusberti (2012) discussed earlier (p. 745), individuals with angry personalities made riskier financial deci- sions (e.g., more likely to have invested money in stocks and shares) than non-angry ones. Other research reveals complexities in the effects of anger on decision-making. First, Kugler et al. (2012) found angry participants on their own were much less risk-averse than happy or fearful ones on a lottery task involving large real-money payoffs. However, only 7% of angry participants chose the risky option when the outcome depended on the other person’s choice. These angry participants did not want to lose control of the situation by being reliant on someone else. Second, Ferrer et al. (2017) assessed risky decision-making on a task where money could be earned by pumping up balloons provided they did not burst. Angry male participants engaged in riskier decision-making than sad or neutral participants, but angry female participants did not exhibit risky behaviour.

From Shiota et al. (2017). conducted a meta-analysis of previous research. It may occur because anger is more associated with perceived control in men than women. Anger often impairs individuals’ decision-making. In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, it “blows out the light of reason”. For example, consider research on driving behaviour. As discussed earlier (p. 730), Zhang and Chan (2016) found in a review that anger was associated with aggressive and risky driving, and with driving errors. Techer et al. (2017) discovered the high arousal and mind-wandering caused by anger partly explained the negative effects of anger on driving performance. Why does anger impair decision-making? It can lead to shallow pro- cessing based on heuristics (rules of thumb) rather than systematic or analytic processing (Litvak et al., 2010). For example, Coget et al. (2011) found film directors mostly resorted to intuitive decision-making when moderately or very angry, whereas moderate anxiety led to analytic pro- cessing. If angry individuals engage in little analytic processing, we would expect their decision-making to be unaffected if they performed an addi- tional task designed to prevent analytic processing at the same time. That is precisely what Small and Lerner (2008) found. Positive mood Campos et al. (2013) argued there are at least eight different positive moods: awe, amusement, interest, pride, gratitude, joy, love and contentment. Their approach was developed by Shiota et al. (2017; see Figure 15.18). All positive emotions depend on a common neural reward system including the mesolim- bic pathway (linking the ventral tegmental areas and nucleus accumbens) Sexual desire Nurturant love Pride Serotonin Cannabinoids Opioids Enthusiasm Dopaminergic reward system Testosterone Oxytocin Awe Amusement Attachment love Contentment Gratitude Liking/ pleasure Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["ibit risky behaviour.","This gender difference was also found when Ferrer et al."]}

As a result of evolution, humans possess nine positive emotions that are elicited in different situations and involve different combinations of neurotransmitters and hormones. In spite of increasing evidence that we possess several positive emo- tions, there is a puzzling difference between research on negative and posi- tive affect. Three different kinds of negative affect (anxiety; sadness; anger) have been emphasised in research on judgement and decision. However, until recently, the effects of only a single broad category of positive affect on judgement and decision-making have been explored. Much research on positive affect has focused on optimism bias (indi- viduals anticipate experiencing more positive and fewer negative events than others). We would expect optimism bias to be stronger among those in a positive mood than those in a negative or neutral mood. Lench and Levine (2005) found individuals in a happy mood had greater optimism bias than fearful participants. However, they were no more optimistic than individuals in a neutral mood. Koellinger and Treffers (2015) studied a related effect: overconfidence in one’s performance on a general knowledge quiz. Positive affect caused by unexpectedly receiving a gift (bear-shaped jelly sweets) produced over- confidence when participants were unlikely to attribute their positive affect to the gift. In contrast, there was no overconfidence when they were aware of the source of their positive feelings. Thus, one reason why positive affect is often associated with optimistic judgements is because it is regarded as providing positive feedback on their performance. Decision-making In a review, Blanchette and Richards (2010) concluded positive mood states are typically associated with a risk-averse approach to decision-making. For example, sex behaviour increasing the risk of HIV for gay men is less common among those with high positive affect (Mustanski, 2007) and indi- viduals in a positive mood make less risky decisions when betting on hypo- thetical horse races (Cahir & Thomas, 2010). Decision-making can vary depending on the specific form of posi- tive affect. Eherenfreund-Hager and Taubman-Ben-Ari (2016) compared the effects of relaxed positive affect (produced by thinking of a calm and peaceful event) and aroused positive affect (produced by thinking of a happy and exciting event). Only the former was associated with a reduced willingness to drive recklessly. Thus, decision-making may typically be risk-averse when individuals experience high positive affect but not when positive affect involves excitement. Positive affect is associated with increased use of heuristic or low- effort processing and decreased use of analytic processing. Suppose you must choose repeatedly between two gambles: (1) 50% chance of winning 1.20 euros and 50% chance of winning nothing; and (2) 50% chance of winning 1.00 euro and 50% chance of winning nothing. Analytic thinking would lead you to choose the first gamble on every trial. De Vries et al. (2012) found happy participants were less likely than sad ones to use ana- lytic thinking.

(2012) assessed participants’ explicit attitudes (involv- ing analytic processing) towards apples and candy bars and their implicit attitudes (involving non-analytic or heuristic processing). Then the partici- pants were asked to choose between an apple and a candy bar. For happy participants, their choice was predicted only by their implicit attitudes (see Figure 15.19). For sad participants, in contrast, their choice was predicted only by their explicit attitudes (see Figure 15.19). Thus, decision-making (i.e., candy bar or apple?) was based on heuristic processing for happy individuals but by analytic thinking for sad ones. Griskevicius et al. (2010) studied the effects of several positive mood states on the ability to assess the persuasiveness of strong and weak argu- ments. Participants experiencing three positive emotions (anticipatory enthusiasm; amusement; attachment love) exhibited heuristic or shallow processing. However, for reasons that are unclear, participants experienc- ing two other positive emotions (awe; nurturant love) exhibited less heuris- tic processing than those in a neutral mood state. JUDGEMENT AND DECISION-MAKING: THEORETICAL APPROACHES We have now discussed the effects of several mood states on judgement and decision-making. Mood states differ in the pattern of effects (see Figure 15.20). Of theoretical importance, the pattern varies across the three negative mood states of anxiety, sadness and anger.

Accordingly, anxious individuals are motivated to reduce anxiety by increasing certainty and predictability, which can be achieved by minimising risk taking and choosing non-risky options. Individuals become sad or depressed when they discover a desired goal is unattainable. Sadness or depression leads individuals to abandon the unachievable goal and engage in extensive thinking (i.e., analytic processing) to focus on new goals (Andrews & Thomson, 2009). This helps us to under- stand why sadness is the only mood state associated with analytic processing. Anger has the function of overcoming some obstacles to an important goal by taking direct and aggressive action. This approach is most likely to be found when individuals feel they have personal control and are thus optimistic the goal can be achieved (Lerner & Tiedens, 2006). This percep- tion of personal control also persuades angry individuals to take risks to achieve their goals. An important function of positive mood states is to maintain the current mood (Oatley & Johnson-Laird, 1987). This leads happy individ- uals to engage in shallow or heuristic processing and to avoid taking risks that might endanger their positive mood state. Appraisal-tendency framework The appraisal-tendency framework (Lerner & Keltner, 2000) is relevant to understanding how moods influence judgement and decision-making. This framework (see Han et al., 2007) extends the appraisal-theory approach dis- cussed earlier (pp. 719–724). It is assumed each emotion results from certain cognitive appraisals. Emotions often alter cognitive processes to assist the individual to respond appropriately to the situation triggering the emotion. Of crucial importance, it is assumed theoretically the effects of any given emotion on judgement and decision-making depend more on the appraisal processes associated with it than on its valence (positive or negative affect). Findings The appraisal-tendency framework explains many findings discussed earlier. Here are two examples. According to the framework, emotions differ along the appraisal continuum of uncertainty-certainty (i.e., the extent to which future events seem predictable). More specifically, anger and positive affect (happiness) are associated with high certainty whereas fear or anxiety and sadness are associated with low certainty. Bagneux et al. (2013) used the Iowa Gambling Task (see Glossary) on which decision-making is generally superior when participants use intuitive rather than deliberative processing. They predicted participants experiencing certainty-associated emotions would use intuitive processing based on emotional cues from previous outcomes. In contrast, those experiencing uncertainty-associated emotions would use deliberative processing. As pre- dicted, participants induced to feel certainty (anger; happiness; disgust) made superior decisions to those induced to feel uncertainty (fear; sadness). İyilikci and Amado (2018) replicated these findings for disgust, fear and sadness.

Beisswingert et al. (2015) exposed partic- ipants to a situation involving loss of control which they predicted would produce anger and lead to risk-taking behaviour. The findings were as pre- dicted. Of particular importance, the impact of the situation on risk-taking behaviour depended on the extent to which it caused anger. Emotion-imbued choice model You are probably thinking the effects of affect on judgement and decision-making are complex. If so, you are right! Much of this complex- ity is included within Lerner et al.’s (2015) emotion-imbued choice model (Figure 15.21). We start with the solid lines. These indicate the major factors included in traditional models of decision-making: decision-makers evaluate the available options by considering the expected outcomes asso- ciated with each option. Characteristics of the options (e.g., probabilities; time delays) and of the decision-maker (e.g., risk aversion; personality) are also considered as is the notion that expected emotions influence the deci- sion process (line A). The roles of emotion are shown by the green dotted lines. Current emotions are influenced by: (1) characteristics of the decision-maker (e.g., chronic anxiety; line B’); (2) characteristics of the choice options (line C’); (3) predicted emotions (e.g., if you expect to be made anxious you may experience anxiety now; line F); (4) contemplating the decision (especially if the options are nearly equally (un)attractive; line G’); and (5) incidental emotions (e.g., those caused by the weather; line H). Current emotions directly influence the evaluation of the outcomes (e.g., whether heuristic or analytic processing is used; which motivational goals are active; line G). They also indirectly influence decision-making by Figure 15.21 The emotion-imbued choice model (see text for details). From Lerner et al. (2015).

In sum, the emotion-imbued choice model provides the most com- prehensive account of the ways decision-making is influenced by emotion. We can see earlier decision-making approaches (e.g., von Neumann and Morgenstern’s 1944 utility theory; see chapter 13) were more limited with reference to Figure 15.21. According to these approaches, each option during decision-making is evaluated with respect to the three factors shown by the solid lines A, B and C. What are the limitations of the emotion-imbued choice model? First, it provides a framework rather than a fully fledged theory or model. Second, it is oversimplified. As Lerner et al. (2015, p. 814) admitted, “It assumes that the decision-maker faces a one-time choice between given options, without the possibility of seeking additional information or options.” ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND COGNITIVE BIASES Most research discussed above dealt with effects of mood manipulations on cognitive processing and performance. We can also focus on cogni- tive processing in individuals who are generally in a given mood state (e.g., patients with an anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder). Alternatively, we can study healthy individuals having anxious or depres- sive personalities. For example, anxious individuals can be selected by using questionnaires assessing trait anxiety (susceptibility to experiencing anxiety). Implementing the above research strategies is complicated because anxious individuals tend to be depressed and vice versa. Comorbidity is the term indicating a patient has two or more mental disorders at the same time. Comorbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders is found in 20% to 40% of patients (Huppert, 2008). In similar fashion, anxiety and depression are moderated highly correlated in healthy individuals. In spite of the overlap between anxiety and depression, there are important differences between them. Later we consider three major theo- retical approaches focusing on such differences. Why is it important to study cognitive processes in anxious and depressed individuals? Anxious and depressed patients differ from healthy individuals in several ways (e.g., cognitively; behaviourally; physiologi- cally). Therapies differ in terms of the symptoms that are the central focus in treatment. Within this context, it is of major theoretical importance to establish the role played by cognitive factors. Many theorists (e.g., Beck & Dozois, 2011) assume vulnerability to clinical anxiety and depressions partly depends on cognitive factors. It is also often assumed that one goal of cognitive therapy (and cognitive- behavioural therapy) should be to reduce various cognitive biases. Here are four important cognitive biases: ● Attentional bias: selective attention to emotionally negative stimuli presented at the same time as neutral stimuli; this can involve rapid attentional engagement with negative stimuli and/or slow attentional disengagement. KEY TERMS Trait anxiety A personality dimension based on individual differences in susceptibility to anxiety. Comorbidity The state of affairs when a patient has two (or more) mental disorders at the same time. Attentional bias Selective allocation of attention to emotionally negative stimuli when presented simultaneously with neutral stimuli.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\n754 Broadening horizons ● Interpretive bias: the tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli and sit- uations in a negative fashion. ● Explicit memory bias: the tendency to retrieve mostly negative or unpleasant rather than positive or neutral information on memory tests involving conscious recollection. ● Implicit memory bias: the tendency to exhibit superior performance for negative than for positive or neutral information on memory tests not involving conscious recollection. An individual possessing all the above cognitive biases would attend exces- sively to negative environmental events, would interpret most ambiguous situations negatively, and so would perceive themselves as having experi- enced numerous unpleasant events. As a consequence, it is assumed they would be more likely than other people to develop an anxiety disorder or depression. However, a key issue here is causality: do cognitive biases trigger anxiety and depression; do anxiety and depression enhance cognitive biases; or is causality bidirectional? Theoretical approaches Below we discuss major theoretical approaches to understanding the sim- ilarities (and differences) between anxiety and depression. Note these approaches are not necessarily incompatible with each other (see Eysenck & Fajkowska, 2018; Eysenck & Holmes, in press). Functional approach Anxiety and depression both have adaptive functions even though they often involve high short-term costs (Del Guidice & Ellis, 2015). Depression is typically caused by goal loss (Oatley & Johnson-Laird, 1987) and has the adaptive function of leading to sustained thinking about disengaging from the lost goal and generating a new one. Anxiety is typically caused by a threat to self-preservation (Oatley & Johnson-Laird, 1987) and has the function of increasing selective attention to potential environmental threats and rapid detection of danger (Eysenck, 1992). The above functional approach implies depression is mostly associated with a past orientation whereas anxiety is mostly associated with a future orientation. Eysenck et al. (2006) asked healthy individuals to identify per- sonal events strongly associated with anxiety or depression. Anxious events related more to the future than the past. In contrast, depressive events were much more associated with the past. Additional supportive evidence comes from research on worry and rumination. Worry and rumination both involve persistent, repetitive neg- ative thoughts. However, they differ because worry is typically triggered by “What if?” questions whereas rumination is triggered by “Why?” questions (Papageorgiou, 2006). Unsurprisingly, worry is associated with a greater future orientation than rumination whereas rumination is associated with a greater past orientation (Watkins et al., 2005). Of relevance to the functional approach, rumination in the clinical literature is mostly considered in the context of major depressive disorder KEY TERMS Interpretive bias The tendency when presented with ambiguous stimuli or situations to interpret them in a negative way. Explicit memory bias The retrieval of relatively more negative information than positive or neutral information on tests of explicit memory. Implicit memory bias Relatively better memory performance for negative than for neutral or positive information on tests of implicit memory.

In contrast, worry is the central symptom of generalised anxiety disorder (pervasive anxiety across several life domains). Williams et al. (1997) made several specific predictions based on the functional approach. Before discussing these predictions, we must consider their distinction between perceptual and conceptual processes. Perceptual processes are stimulus-driven or bottom-up: they are often fast and “auto- matic” and are used in basic attention and implicit memory. In contrast, conceptual processes are top-down and are slower and more controlled than perceptual ones. They are involved in explicit memory and can also be involved in some attentional processes and implicit memory. Since anxiety has the function of anticipating danger, it should facilitate the perceptual processing of threat-related stimuli. In contrast, depression has the function of replacing failed goals. As a result, “the conceptual pro- cessing of internally generated material related to failure or loss may be more relevant to this function than perceptual vigilance” (Williams et al., 1997, p. 315). The above assumptions generate several predictions: (1) Anxious individuals should have an attentional bias for threatening stimuli when perceptual processes are involved. Depressed individuals should have an attentional bias only when conceptual processing is involved. (2) Anxious and depressed individuals should have an interpretive bias for ambiguous stimuli and situations. (3) Depressed individuals should have an explicit memory bias, but anxious ones should not. (4) Anxious individuals should have an implicit memory bias, but de pr essed ones should not when only perceptual processes are involved. Tripartite model Clark and Watson’s (1991) tripartite model (developed by Watson, 2009) identified major similarities and differences between anxiety and depression. They resemble each other in that both are strongly associated with distress and other negative emotional states. They differ in two ways: (1) Positive emotionality (involving energy and pleasurable engagement) is lacking in depression but not anxiety. (2) Physiological hyperarousal is present in anxiety but not depression. It follows that anxious and depressed individuals should differ in their pro- cessing of emotionally positive stimuli. Depressed (but not anxious) indi- viduals should have reduced responsiveness to such stimuli. Attentional bias Various tasks assess attentional bias (Yiend et al., 2013). First, there is the dot-probe task (see Figure 15.22).

In Figure 15.22, one stimulus is emotionally positive (e.g. smiling face) and the other is neutral. On critical trials, however, one stimulus is emotionally negative (e.g., angry face) and the other neutral (e.g., expressionless face). The participant’s allocation of attention is assessed by recording the speed of detection of a dot replac- ing one stimulus. Attentional bias is indicated by shorter detection latencies when the dot replaces the negative stimulus. Second, there is the emotional Stroop task in which participants rapidly name the colour in which words are printed (see Figure 15.23). Some words are emotionally negative whereas others are neutral. Attentional bias is defined by participants taking longer to name the colours of emotional than neutral words or faces (but see below). Findings Bar-Haim et al. (2007) carried out a meta- analysis of attentional bias in anxious individ- uals. There was strong evidence of attentional bias across all anxiety disorders and in high trait-anxious healthy individuals. We can distinguish two aspects of biased attention: (1) speed of attentional engagement with negative stimuli (attentional bias); and (2) subsequent attentional disengagement from such stimuli. Anxious patients have fast attentional engagement (dependent on a largely “automatic” threat- detection mechanism) and slow disengage- ment (mostly due to poor attentional control) (Cisler & Koster, 2010). The dot-probe and emotional Stroop tasks provide only a snapshot of where attention is directed. In contrast, eye-tracking provides a fairly direct and continuous assessment of visual attention.

However, anxiety did not influence the time taken to fixate emotionally positive stimuli. The evidence relating to attentional bias in depression is less consis tent. Kircanski and Gotlib (2015) reported in a review that patients with major depressive disorder did not show rapid engagement with negative stimuli but had slow disengagement. In a meta-analysis, Winer and Salem (2016) found significant avoidance of emotionally positive stimuli in depressed individuals. The tendency for attentional bias (fast engagement) to be stronger in anxious than depressed individuals is consistent with the functional approach and its assumption that anxious individuals focus on potential future threats (Eysenck & Fajkowska, 2018). The finding that depressed individuals (but not anxious ones) avoid emotionally positive stimuli is partly consistent with the tripartite model which assumes they have a very limited ability to exhibit positive emotion. However, that model does not explain why depressed individuals avoid (rather than ignore) posi- tive stimuli. According to Winer and Salem (2016), depressed individuals actively inhibit rewarding stimuli. Finally, we turn to the effects of depression on engagement with emo- tionally negative stimuli. Most research has failed to obtain significant findings. However, Peckham et al. (2010) reported that depressed individ- uals showed attentional bias with depression-relevant stimuli but not when physically or socially threatening stimuli were used. These findings are con- sistent with the content-specific hypothesis (Beck, 1976; Beck & Dozois, 2011). According to this hypothesis depressed individuals have very neg- ative beliefs about themselves, the world and the future, and attend to stimuli relevant to those beliefs. Limitations What are the limitations of research in this area? First, the two main para- digms (i.e., dot-probe; emotional Stroop) provided limited information con- cerning the time course of attentional processing. However, more detailed information is available from eye-tracking studies. Second, most findings indicate an association between anxiety or depression and attentional bias. Such findings cannot clarify the causal- ity issue. Later we discuss research showing that changes in attentional TABLE 15.1 EFFECTS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ON ATTENTIONAL BIAS (ENGAGEMENT AND DISENGAGEMENT) Attentional bias (fast engagement) and Attentional bias (slow disengagement) Emotionally negative stimuli Anxiety YES YES Depression NO (?)

Van Bockstaele et al. (2014, p. 682) concluded their review as follows: “The relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is best described as a bidirectional, maintaining or mutually reinforcing relation.” Interpretive bias We often encounter ambiguous situations. For example, suppose someone walks past you without acknowledging your presence. Perhaps they simply failed to notice you or perhaps they actively dislike you. Individuals who generally interpret ambiguous situations in a negative way have an inter- pretive bias. Anxious individuals have an interpretive bias. Eysenck et al. (1987) asked participants varying in trait anxiety to write down the spellings of auditorily presented words. Some were homophones (two words with the same pronunciation but different spellings (e.g., die, dye; pain, pane). Trait anxiety correlated +.60 with the number of negative or threatening homo- phone interpretations. Individuals high in trait anxiety do not have an interpretive bias for all potentially threatening situations. High trait anxiety is associated with an interpretive bias for ambiguous situations potentially involving social or intellectual threat but not those involving physical or health threat (Walsh et al., 2015). Thus, interpretive bias in high-anxious individuals is limited to interpersonal threats (i.e., negative reactions of others to one’s behaviour). Eysenck et al. (1991) studied patients with generalised anxiety disorder (see Glossary) who heard ambiguous sentences such as the following: (1) At the refugee camp, the weak/week would soon be finished. (2) The doctor examined little Emma’s growth. (3) They discussed the priest’s convictions. Generalised anxiety disorder patients were more likely than healthy con- trols to interpret such sentences in a negative or threatening way. Thus, they exhibited interpretive bias. Everaert et al. (2017b) obtained two main findings in a meta- analytic review of interpretive bias in depression. First, there was a moderately strong relationship between depression and interpretive bias for both patients with clinical depression and depressed healthy individuals. Second, this relationship was stronger with self-referential material (i.e., making reference to the individual’s character and/or experience) than with mate- rial that was not self-referential. Does interpretive bias depend mostly on rapid, “automatic” processes or on slower, strategic ones? Both processes are involved (Mathews, 2012). Evidence for strategic processes was reported by Calvo and Castillo (1997). High-anxious individuals had an interpretive bias for ambiguous sentences 1,250 ms after the sentence but not at 500 ms. Evidence interpretive bias can occur fairly rapidly was reported by Moser et al. (2012).

Memory biases Why is it important to study memory biases in anxious and depressed indi- viduals? Such biases may well maintain negative mood states via conscious processes (explicit memory bias) or relatively automatic processes (implicit memory bias). We start with explicit memory bias. There is convincing evidence for an explicit memory bias associ- ated with depression (Blaney, 1986). This memory bias was also found when research on autobiographical memory was reviewed (Holland & Kensinger, 2010). A positive memory bias (i.e., enhanced memory for pos- itive versus neutral material) is sometimes absent in depressed individuals (Foland-Ross and Gotlib, 2012). This finding is consistent with the tripar- tite model’s assumption that depressed individuals have a limited ability to exhibit positive emotions. Several studies have focused on implicit memory bias in depression. Phillips et al. (2010) reported a small (but significant) relationship between depression and implicit memory bias in a meta-analysis. Williams et al. (1997) argued this would not be found when perceptual processes were involved. However, Phillips et al. found evidence for an implicit memory bias associated with depression even when perceptual processing occurred at encoding or learning and retrieval. What are the effects of anxiety on memory biases? Herrera et al. (2017) addressed this issue in a meta-analytic review. They obtained three main findings. First, there was an explicit memory bias in anxiety for free recall (see Glossary) but not cued recall (see Glossary) or recognition memory. More extensive retrieval processes are required for free recall than for cued recall or recognition, providing more scope for the involvement of emotion. Second, there was no implicit memory bias associated with anxiety, which is directly contrary to the prediction of Williams et al. (1997). In sum, the effects of depression and anxiety on memory biases differ; indeed, there are greater differences between depressed and anxious indi- viduals with respect to memory biases than attentional or interpretive biases. Explicit memory bias is typically stronger and found across a wider range of memory tests in depressed individuals. Implicit memory bias is generally found in depressed individuals but is absent in anxious ones. These findings are consistent with the notion that depression is more associated than anxiety with an orientation towards the past (Eysenck et al., 2006) and are partially consistent with the theoretical approach of Williams et al. (1997). Combined cognitive biases hypothesis Most theorists have treated the various cognitive biases as if they were entirely separate from each other. Hirsch et al. (2006) challenged this approach. According to their combined cognitive biases hypothesis, cog- nitive biases often interact with each other. Suppose an anxious person attends selectively to the threatening aspects of a situation.

There is reasonable support for the above hypothesis. Consider a study by Amir et al. (2010) with socially anxious participants. Training to reduce interpretive bias made it easier for participants to disengage attention from threat. These findings suggest attentional and interpretive biases reflect (at least in part) the operation of shared mechanisms. Everaert et al. (2014) conducted a study in which depressed and non-depressed participants received a scrambled sentences task (e.g., “am winner born loser a I”) and constructed sentences using all the words bar one. Subsequently, the participants recalled their previously constructed sentences. Everaert et al. assessed attentional, interpretive and explicit memory biases. The memory bias associated with depression was mediated by attentional and interpretive biases. Cognitive or attentional control Anxious and depressed individuals may have the various cognitive biases discussed above primarily because they are sensitive to emotionally nega- tive or threatening information. However, more general processes also play a part. For example, suppose anxious and depressed individuals have defi- cient cognitive or attentional control. As a consequence, they might have increased attentional bias because they find it hard to disengage from neg- ative stimuli and increased interpretive bias because they cannot easily sup- press threatening interpretations. Booth et al. (2017) reported findings consistent with the notions above. They assessed attentional and interpretive biases in individuals differing in trait anxiety. In one condition, these biases were assessed while partici- pants performed a secondary task restricting their ability to exercise cog- nitive control. The relationship between anxiety and both cognitive biases was stronger when participants had limited use of cognitive control. Two key cognitive control processes are inhibition and shifting (see Chapter 6). Inhibition involves overriding dominant responses and resist- ing distraction, whereas shifting involves switching flexibly between tasks. Joormann et al. (2007) proposed a theory based on the assumption depressed individuals have impaired cognitive control. As you can see in Figure 15.24, the theory predicts this impaired cognitive control causes problems in dis- engaging attention from negative information. Depressed individuals are likely to elaborate on this information while attending to it. This can lead to enhanced memory for such information (i.e., a memory bias). Joormann & Tanovic (2015) reviewed research on depression and cog- nitive control. There was clear evidence depression is associated with diffi- culties in both inhibition and shifting. For example, Zetsche and Joormann (2012) found deficient inhibitory control was associated with a greater number of depressive symptoms and predicted the maintenance of depres- sive symptoms over the following six months. Joormann and Tanovic also discussed research suggesting the deficient inhibitory control of depressed individuals is associated with their cognitive biases. Impaired cognitive control is also relevant to understanding the effects of anxiety on cognitive processing and biases.

This impairs the efficiency of atten- tional or cognitive control (which depends on working memory) in two ways. First, it impairs inhibitory control including the ability to avoid processing task-irrelevant stimuli. Second, it impairs the ability to shift atten- tion or cognitive control optimally within and between tasks. Eysenck and Derakshan (2011) reviewed research findings showing that high trait anxiety is associated with inefficient inhibitory control and shifting. Derryberry and Reed (2002) found atten- tional or cognitive control was important in determining attention bias. Attentional bias was weaker in high-anxious individuals with high attentional control than those with low attentional control. Taylor et al. (2016) found individuals high in social anxiety showed slow disengagement from social threat stimuli only if low in the shifting form of attentional control. Finally, we consider why anxious and depressed individuals spend much of their time engaged in worry and/or rumination. In essence, their deficient cognitive and atten- tional control makes it harder for them than for other people to disengage from their nega- tive internal thoughts. In sum, one reason why high-anxious and depressed individuals have cognitive biases is because they have deficient cognitive or attentional control. Shortly we will discuss therapy for anxiety and depression based on the attempt to enhance cognitive control. The success of such therapy suggests deficient cognitive control maintains cognitive biases and high levels of anxiety and depression. COGNITIVE BIAS MODIFICATION AND BEYOND We have seen anxiety and depression are both associated with various cognitive biases. The direction of causality is crucial – do cognitive biases make individuals vulnerable to developing anxiety or depression or does being anxious or depressed lead to the development of cognitive biases? An appropriate method for addressing this issue is cognitive bias modifica- tion: “methods designed to modify cognitive factors that maintain psychiat- ric conditions such as anxiety and depression” (Lau, 2015, p. 735). Cognitive bias modification is a form of cognitive behavioural therapy, which involves using psychological methods to change unhelpful distorted or biased cognitions and behaviour. Thus, cognitive behavioural therapy encompasses numerous techniques in addition to those associated with cognitive bias modification. KEY TERM Cognitive bias modification Training typically designed to reduce attentional bias and/ or interpretive bias in anxious or depressed individuals. Figure 15.24 According to the impaired cognitive control account put forward by Joormann et al. (2007), depression is associated with cognitive control impairments that lead to impaired attentional disengagement, elaborative processing and memory biases. From Everaert et al. (2012).

Cognitive bias modification typically involves attempts to reduce attentional bias and/or interpretive bias. A common form of training to reduce attentional bias involves the dot-probe task (discussed earlier, pp. 755–756). The task is altered so the dot always appears where the neutral stimulus had been presented, leading participants to learn to avoid attending to the threat-related stimulus. Training to reduce interpretive bias often involves presenting ambiguous sentences that can be interpreted negatively or positively (e.g., “When some of your colleagues unexpectedly see you, their reaction is one of . . .”). Each sentence is followed by a word fragment to be completed by the participant. The word fragment is selected to produce a positive sentence completion (e.g., pl _ _ sure producing pleasure). How effective is cognitive bias modification? Liu et al. (2017) carried out a meta-analysis on the use of cognitive bias modification to treat social anxiety disorder. Treatment reduced attentional bias and interpretive bias (especially interpretive bias). Both forms of bias modification produced modest reductions in anxiety, with interpretive bias modification being more effective. Cristea et al. (2015) conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of cognitive bias modification on individuals high in anxiety or depression. Treatment reduced both anxiety and depression. However, the effects were typically fairly modest. Why were the findings so modest? Grafton et al. (2017) pointed out that Cristea et al. (2015) failed to differentiate between studies where attentional and/or interpretive bias were successfully reduced and those where these biases were not significantly reduced. Since the crucial theoretical assumption is that beneficial effects of cognitive bias modification on anxiety and depression are mediated by reducing cognitive biases, there should be no beneficial effects when such biases are not reduced. Grafton et al. re-analysed Cristea et al.’s data. There were moderately strong reductions in anxiety and depression in every study in which cognitive biases were successfully reduced but no reductions when they were not reduced. Jones and Sharpe (2017) provided the most comprehensive account of the effectiveness of cognitive bias modification based on 12 meta-analyses. Cognitive bias modification was generally reasonably effective in the treatment of anxiety. However, its beneficial effects were weaker in the treatment of depression. How can we enhance cognitive bias modification? Lee et al. (2015) argued that the standard approach to reducing interpretive bias is limited because it only requires participants to provide positive interpretations of ambiguous sentences. Accordingly, they extended this approach by requiring some participants to imagine a future positive event related to their interpretation of each ambiguous sentence. This extended approach was more effective than the standard one perhaps because it made clearer the relevance of positive interpretations of ambiguous events for the future. Cognitive control We saw earlier that anxious and depressed individuals have impaired atten- tional or cognitive control and that this impaired control partially explains their various cognitive biases. A plausible inference from these findings is that therapy designed to enhance cognitive control might prove effective in treating anxious and depressed patients. Cognitive bias modification of attentional bias may depend on improved top-down attentional control or more specific processes (e.g., reduced Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["and memory biases.","From Everaert et al."]}

Booth et al. (2014) obtained evidence that attentional control is important – cognitive bias modification of attentional bias in anxious individuals was ineffective when the conditions reduced participants’ ability to use attentional control. Sari et al. (2016) provided training designed to enhance attentional control. Individuals exhibiting the largest gains in attentional control tended to show the great- est reductions in trait anxiety. Koster et al. (2017) carried out a meta-analytic review of research on cognitive control interventions in the treatment of depression. They con- cluded that “Most CCT [cognitive control training] studies have yielded promising effects in MDD [major depressive disorder] samples in terms of reducing cognitive vulnerability for depression” (p. 86). We need to achieve a greater understanding of how cognitive control and cognitive biases interact to determine an individual’s level of anxiety or depression. Everaert et al. (2017a) addressed this issue by obtaining measures of cognitive control (e.g., inhibition; shifting), attentional and interpretive biases and depressive symptoms. They obtained three main findings: (1) There were no direct effects of deficient cognitive control on depres- sive symptoms. (2) Deficient cognitive control influenced depressive symptoms indirectly through its effects on attentional bias. (3) Deficient inhibitory control influenced interpretive bias which was in turn associated with depressive symptoms. Evaluation What are the strengths of research in this area? First, studies of cognitive bias modification have shown treatment effective in reducing attentional and interpretive biases generally leads to reductions in anxiety and depres- sion (especially anxiety). Thus, an important reason why many individuals have high levels of anxiety and depression is because they have attentional and interpretive biases. Second, other forms of treatment for anxiety and depression (e.g., cognitive-behavioural therapy) involve several components. As a conse- quence, it is often unclear why a given form of treatment reduces clini- cal symptoms. In contrast, cognitive bias modification techniques are very focused, making it easier to identify the underlying mechanisms. What are the limitations of cognitive bias modification techniques? First, the effects of these techniques on cognitive biases and on levels of anxiety and depression are somewhat variable. A major factor here is the rapid increase of studies in which modification techniques were presented online via the internet under poorly supervised and controlled condi- tions. MacLeod and Clarke (2015) found attentional bias was successfully reduced in only 11% of online studies compared to 74% of studies con- ducted in laboratory conditions. Second, cognitive biases in anxiety and depression depend on general, top-down control processes as well as on processes specific to processing emotionally loaded information.

However, the relative importance of these two types of processes and how they interact remain unclear. Third, the assessment of symptomatology following cognitive bias modification typically focuses only on self-report measures. Future studies should use additional measures (e.g., physiological; behavioural) to iden- tify the full range of changes produced. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. Moods typically last longer than emotions but are less intense. The brain mechanisms underlying emotions consist of large-scale networks not specific to any given emotion. Emotional experience is determined by complex interactions between bottom-up and top-down processes. • Appraisal theories. Appraisal theories assume emotional experience is mostly determined by cognitive appraisals of the current situation. They also assume cognitive appraisal can involve automatic processes as well as more controlled ones. Limitations of appraisal theories include: (1) the unwarranted assumption that situational appraisal is always crucial in determining emotional experience; (2) the de-emphasis of social factors in influencing our emotional reactions; and (3) the assumption there is a clear-cut distinction between cognition and emotion. • Emotion regulation. Emotion regulation involves individuals overriding their initial emotional responses. Key emotion- regulation strategies are attention deployment, cognitive change (e.g., reappraisal) and response modulation. Cognitive change is generally the most effective strategy for reducing negative affect and response modulation the least effective, but strategy effectiveness depends on the precise situation. Many successful strategies are associated with prefrontal activation leading to reduced amygdala activation. Effortful emotion-regulation strategies are most effective early in processing of negative emotional situations, whereas timing matters less for relatively undemanding strategies. Emotion- regulation strategies can involve explicit and/or implicit processes. • Affect and cognition: attention and memory. Negative affect often produces attentional narrowing whereas positive affect produces attentional broadening. However, emotional states (positive or negative) involving high motivational intensity are associated with attentional narrowing, whereas those involving low motivational intensity are associated with attentional broadening. In addition, positive affect often causes individuals to maintain Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["sing emotionally loaded information.","There is suggestive evidence that therapy Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58."]}

In addition, positive affect often causes individuals to maintain Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\nCognition and emotion 765 their current attentional strategy whereas negative affect causes them to change their attentional strategy. Mood states influence memory through mood congruity and mood-state-dependent memory; these effects are stronger with positive mood states. Two brain networks (one mostly involved in memory and the other in attention and cognitive control) influence the memory-enhancing effects of mood or emotion. The amygdala is of importance within both networks. • Affect and cognition: judgement and decision-making. According to the dual-process model, deontological judgements with moral dilemmas are based on rapid affective processing, whereas utilitarian ones are based on slower, cognitive processing. This model is oversimplified as is demonstrated by a model focusing on consequences, moral norms and preference for inaction vs action. Anxiety, sadness, anger and positive affect all have different patterns of effects on judgement and decision-making. Many effects can be explained by assuming anxiety increases the need to reduce uncertainty, sadness increases the need to rethink priorities, anger creates a sense of personal control, and positive affect creates a desire to maintain the current mood state. The emotion- imbued choice model provides a comprehensive account of the main factors (e.g., current emotion; characteristics of the decision-maker; nature of the task) influencing judgement and decision-making. • Anxiety, depression and cognitive biases. Anxiety and depression are associated with various cognitive biases such as: attentional bias; interpretive bias; explicit memory bias; and implicit memory bias. Changes in one cognitive bias often produce changes in other cognitive biases. Attentional bias tends to be somewhat stronger in anxiety than depression, whereas the opposite is the case with memory biases. These differences are understandable given that anxiety has the function of anticipating future threat whereas depression replaces failed goals with new ones. Anxious and depressed individuals have deficient cognitive control (e.g., inhibition; shifting) and this deficient control plays a role in the maintenance of their cognitive biases. • Cognitive bias modification. When cognitive bias modification techniques decrease attentional and/or interpretive bias, they are typically successful in reducing anxiety and depression (especially anxiety). These techniques are very focused which makes it easier to identify the underlying mechanisms. More research is required to establish the extent to which the successful use of cognitive bias modification techniques depends on enhancing cognitive or attentional control.

There is an important distinction between conscious content and conscious level (Bor & Seth, 2012). Conscious content refers to the information of which we are currently aware. Consciousness in this sense is “characterised by the experience of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, awareness of the external world, and often in humans . . . self-awareness” (Colman, 2009, p. 164). This definition is limited because it leads us to ponder the exact meanings of the words “experience” and “self-awareness”. In contrast, conscious level refers to the state of consciousness. It runs from the total unconsciousness of coma through to alert wakeful- ness. These two aspects of consciousness are related – a non-zero con- scious level is required for individuals to experience conscious content or awareness. The notion of levels implies that different states of con- sciousness lie along a single dimension. Thus, for example, patients with disorders of consciousness were traditionally categorised as having dif- ferent levels of consciousness solely on the basis of behavioural meas- ures (e.g., wakefulness; capacity for intentional behaviour). However, some patients exhibit consciousness via their patterns of brain activity in spite of displaying no behavioural evidence of consciousness (Bayne et al., 2017). The above considerations indicate that states of consciousness differ from each other in several dimensions. For example, Bayne et al. (2016) identified two separate dimensions: (1) the range of contents of conscious- ness; and (2) functions of consciousness (e.g., attentional control; action selection). Thus, we need a multidimensional approach to understand- ing consciousness rather than a uni-dimensional one based on levels of consciousness. In this chapter, we focus mostly on consciousness in the former sense of conscious awareness. For example, Block (e.g., 2012) distinguished between two forms of consciousness: Chapter 16 Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.","evidence":["is model combines insights from several previous appraisal and other theories.","Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58."]}

It “refers to the functions that can be associated with consciousness” (Fazekas & Overgaard, 2018, p. 1). (2) Phenomenal consciousness is our raw, private experience; it “refers to the experiential characteristics of consciousness” (Fazekas & Overgaard, 2018, p. 1). Most people believe their immediate conscious experience (phenomenal consciousness) is much richer than the information about that experience we can communicate to others (access consciousness). There is scepticism regarding the above distinction. As Naccache (2018) pointed out, we only know about someone else’s phenomenal con- sciousness from their self-reports (e.g., “I can see the view very clearly”). However, that is very similar to the case with access consciousness (e.g., “I can see two cows in that field”), which suggests the distinction is less important than often assumed. Another problem with phenomenal con- sciousness is that it is very hard to assess the accuracy (or otherwise) of its alleged contents. Baumeister and Masicampo (2010) proposed a different distinction. First, there is phenomenal consciousness, which “describes feelings, sensa- tions, and orienting to the present moment” (p. 945). It is a basic form of consciousness. Second, there is a higher form of consciousness (conscious thought). It “involves the ability to reason, to reflect on one’s experiences, and have a sense of self” (p. 945). Pinker (1997) provided an example of this form of consciousness: “I cannot only feel pain and see red, but think to myself, ‘Hey, here I am, Steve Pinker, feeling pain and seeing red!’” Much progress has been by cognitive neuroscientists with respect to several issues relating to consciousness. These include our ability to: dis- criminate and categorise stimuli; integrate information; access our own internal states; and control our own behaviour. However, we still do not understand why “some neural mechanisms, but not others, should be associated with consciousness” (Tononi et al., 2016, p. 450). This is what Chalmers (2007) called the “hard problem” of consciousness. FUNCTIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS What are the main functions of consciousness? Below are listed some of its proposed functions (although there is fierce ongoing controversy concern- ing some of them): (1) It is associated with perceiving the environment. (2) It plays a key role in social communication and understanding what others are thinking. (3) It plays a role in controlling our actions. (4) It allows us to think about events and issues far removed from the present. People’s conscious thoughts wander away from their current activity (thus displaying “stimulus independence” between 25% and 50% of the time (Konishi & Smallwood, 2016). Such mind-wandering is very useful when planning for the future.

In their own words, Conscious brains may have evolved [because] the world is immensely complex . . . and organisms with brains that can incor- porate statistical regularities that reflect the causal structure of the environment into their own causal structure have an adaptive advantage for prediction and control. (p. 458) (6) It is important with respect to bodily self-consciousness, which is “the experience of being the subject of a given experience” (Blanke et al., 2015, p. 145). If we want to understand the functions of consciousness, it is relevant to consider the controversy concerning the functions and usefulness of uncon- scious processes. It has often been argued that unconscious processes are inflexible and of limited value (see Chapter 5). In contrast, Sigmund Freud famously emphasised its massive power. In this book, we have seen many processes can occur without conscious awareness: perceptual processes (Chapter 2); learning (Chapter 6); memory (Chapter 7); and, possibly, decision-making (Chapter 13). Hassin (2013, p. 195) provocatively proposed the “Yes It Can” prin- ciple: “Unconscious processes can carry out every fundamental high-level [cognitive] function that conscious processes can perform.” Hassin focused on evidence that goal pursuit, cognitive control and reasoning can all occur below the conscious level. If his “Yes It Can” principle is correct, this would devalue the importance of consciousness. Marien et al. (2012) obtained support for the “Yes It Can” principle. Participants performed a proofreading task and the unconscious goal of socialisation was induced in some of them by presenting socialisation- relevant words (e.g., partying; celebrating) subliminally (below the level of conscious awareness). This unconscious socialisation goal impaired proof- reading performance in participants for whom socialisation was an impor- tant goal (see Figure 16.1). Related effects of subliminally presented stimuli on behaviour have often been found, especially when important goals are activated (see Weingarten et al., 2016, for a meta-analytic review). There are two issues with Hassin’s (2013) principle. First, he did not consider problems with establishing that findings supporting his principle depended solely on the use of unconscious processes. Second, he ignored numerous findings apparently inconsistent with his principle (Hesselmann & Moors, 2015). In sum, cognitive functions involving unconscious pro- cesses are probably much more limited in scope than those involving con- scious ones. Consciousness sometimes provides misleading interpretations or rationalisations of events after they have happened (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). Adriaanse et al. (2016) obtained relevant evidence in a study using participants low or high in emotional eating (i.e., the tendency to overeat in response to negative emotions). After they were told they had overeaten, only those high in emotional eating incorrectly claimed their mood state KEY TERM Bodily self-consciousness A form of self- consciousness involving body-centred perception (e.g., of the face, hand or trunk) based on integration of bodily signals from several different sense modalities.

Thus, their conscious belief they had eaten too much because they were sad was a mistaken explanation for overeating. We turn now to a consideration of two major functions of conscious- ness. Social communication is discussed first, followed by controlling action. Social communication A crucial function of consciousness is to facilitate social communication. Humans have lived in social groups for tens of thousands of years and so have needed to predict, understand and manipulate others’ behaviour. This is much easier to do if you can imagine yourself in their position. Graziano and Kastner (2011, p. 98) proposed a theory along those lines: “The machinery that computes information about other people’s awareness is the same machinery that computers information about our own aware- ness” (p. 98). Within this theory, “Awareness . . . is one’s social intelligence perceiving one’s focus of attention” (p. 98). Key aspects of this theory are shown in Figure 16.2. Abel forms a model of Bill’s mental state (“Bill is aware of the cup”) using neuronal machinery specialised for social perception. This machinery is also used for self-awareness. Awareness may originally have been developed to under- stand others with humans only later developing self-awareness. Figure 16.1 Mean scores for error detection on a proofreading task as a function of whether the goal of socialisation had been induced unconsciously (unconscious goal vs no-goal control) and the importance of the goal of socialisation to the participants (low vs high goal importance). Scores closer to zero indicate better error-detection performance. From Marien et al. (2012). © American Psychological Association.

In support, attributing states of awareness to other people is associated with activation in the temporo-parietal junction (Graziano, 2016). In addition, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) applied to this area to inhibit its functioning impairs the ability to switch between representations of the self and another person (Sowden & Catmur, 2015). If perceiving someone else’s awareness and self-awareness depend on the same neuronal mechanisms, we might sometimes be confused as to the source of our awareness. This is, indeed, the case with out-of-body expe- riences, which are “sensations in which a person’s consciousness seems to become detached from the body and take up a remote viewing position” (Blanke et al., 2002, p. 269). Bos et al. (2016) discussed the case of a female patient undergoing brain surgery. Electrical stimulation of part of the tem- poro-parietal junction caused her to feel “as if she was floating just below the ceiling and saw her own body lying on the operating table” (p. 10). Finally, Baumeister et al. (2011, p. 74) identified another social func- tion of conscious thoughts: “Many investigators operationally define conscious thought as those thoughts the person can report to others . . . the purpose of conscious thought is precisely for enabling people to tell their thoughts to one another.” Thus, much of conscious thinking is for talking. Controlling our actions? Numerous times every day we think of doing something followed by actu- ally doing it. For example, “I will get myself a coffee” is followed by me finding myself in a café drinking coffee. Such experiences suggest we have free will: “the ability to make choices and to determine one’s own outcomes Figure 16.2 Awareness as a social perceptual model of attention.

(2018, p. 2) argued, “It seems wildly implausible that human conscious thought evolved purely as a side effect, with no adaptive benefits depending on its ability to guide behaviour.” Over the centuries, philosophers have debated whether humans possess free will without resolving the issue. Many (probably most) psychologists are sceptical about free will. For example, Wegner (2003) claimed we have only the illusion of free will. Our actions are actually caused by uncon- scious processes, but we mistakenly infer our actions are determined by our conscious intentions. He argued this illusion depends on the principles of priority, consistency and exclusivity: When a thought appears in consciousness just before an action (prior- ity), is consistent with the action (consistency), and is not accompanied by conspicuous alternative causes of the action (exclusivity), we experi- ence conscious will and ascribe authorship to ourselves for the action. (p. 67) Much research apparently supports Wegner’s (2003) position that free will is an illusion. In a study by Wegner and Wheatley (1999), two participants (one genuine and the other the researcher’s confederate) placed their fingers on a small board. When they moved the board, a cursor moved over a screen showing pictures of objects. The participants were instructed to stop the cursor every 30 seconds or so and indicate whether they had consciously intended the cursor to stop where it did. Both participants heard words referring to objects through headphones. The confederate was instructed through headphones where to stop the cursor. Genuine participants tended to believe wrongly they had caused the cursor to stop where it did (e.g. on a picture of a cat) if they had heard the word “cat” 1 or 5 seconds beforehand. Their mistaken belief can be explained by the principles of priority, consistency and exclusivity. However, the findings are less impressive than they sound for two reasons. First, only 60% of participants believed their conscious intention caused the cursor to stop even when all three principles applied. Second, the set-up was very artificial and designed to make it hard for participants to understand what was happening. By analogy, no one would argue visual perception is hopelessly fallible simply because we misidentify objects in a thick fog! Van der Weiden et al. (2013) conducted a similar study. Participants stopped a rapid sequence of words by pressing a response key to a stop cue. The sequence stopped at a word (e.g., glass) determined by the com- puter but the participants were not told this. Participants believed they had caused the outcome when the stopped word matched their goal (i.e., it was the one they intended to stop at). They also believed they had caused the outcome when the stopped word matched an earlier prime word presented below the level of conscious awareness. Thus, there are various ways people can be misled into thinking they have caused a given outcome. Below we consider additional experimental evidence.

(2011) reviewed evidence suggesting individuals’ behav- iour often depends crucially on their conscious thoughts even though those thoughts may have been preceded by various unconscious pro- cesses. Strong evidence comes from research on implementation intentions (if-then plans designed to attain some goal; see Glossary; and Chapter 8). Here is an example of an implementation intention: “If I feel depressed, then I will immediately become actively involved in some task”). Toli et al. (2016) found in a meta-analysis (see Glossary) that implementation intentions had a large effect on goal attainment in individuals with mental health problems. Implementation intentions are effective because they produce strong associations between the current situation (if part of the plan) and the goal-related action (then part of the plan). It follows that relatively little effortful action control should be required for goal attainment. As pre- dicted, people have reduced activity in brain areas involved in effortful control (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) when their behaviour is con- trolled by implementation intentions (Wieber et al., 2015). Much behavioural research has focused on individuals’ sense of agency – the “feeling of being in the driving seat when it comes to our actions” (Moore, 2016, p. 1). It would pose some problems for the notion of free will if individuals sometimes have a sense of agency when it is not warranted and lack a sense of agency when it is warranted. Olson et al. (2015) produced a mistaken sense of agency in participants using a simple card trick. A professional magician riffled rapidly through a pack of cards having asked participants to choose one. One card (the target card) was shown for longer than the others. The findings were clear-cut. Almost all (98%) the participants chose the target card. Even though their choice of card had been forced by the magician, 91% of participants felt they had had a free choice. Thus, there was a strong dissociation between participants’ beliefs and reality. Olson et al. (2016) obtained evidence people can mistakenly believe they lack agency. Participants inside a mock brain scanner chose arbitrary numbers. In a mind-reading task, the scanner apparently guessed their chosen number, and in a mind-influencing task it apparently influenced their choice of numbers. As predicted, participants performing the latter task had a reduced sense of agency – they reported lower levels of inter- nal voluntary control over their choices. Among their comments was the following (p. 21): “I feel like it’s a voice . . . dragging me from the number that already exists in my mind.” We can explain the above findings with reference to Wegner’s (2003) exclusivity principle – being consciously aware of a single apparently exter- nal thought led participants to attribute their choices of numbers to the mock scanner. A related phenomenon occurs in schizophrenic patients with delusions of control causing loss of a sense of agency. Here is what was said by a schizophrenic patient (cited by Gallagher & Trigg, 2016, p. 4): “They inserted a computer in my brain. It makes me turn to the left or right. It’s just as if I were being steered around, by who or what I don’t know.” KEY TERM Sense of agency The belief we are determining our own actions.

(1983) asked participants to decide when to bend their wrist and fingers and to indicate when they were consciously aware of their intention to perform those movements. They also recorded event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) to assess the readi- ness potential (reflecting preplanning of a bodily movement). Surprisingly, the readiness potential occurred 350 ms before participants reported con- scious awareness of the intention to bend their wrist and fingers and 550 ms before the actual hand movement. Superficially, Libet et al.’s (1983) findings suggest much processing relating to the intention to make a movement occurs before conscious awareness. However, there are various problems with their study. For example, they focused on the late stage of motor preparation rather than on earlier high-level decision processes. In addition, they studied only when decisions (when shall I move my hand? and ignored what decisions (e.g., what movement shall I make?)). Bode et al. (2011) addressed these limitations. They assessed brain activity in the anterior fronto-polar cortex (associated with decision- making) while participants decided whether to respond with their left or right index finger. Their key finding was that participants’ decisions could Figure 16.3 (a) Region in left fronto- polar cortex for which decoding of upcoming motor decisions was possible.

For various reasons, Bode et al.’s (2011) findings do not cast doubt on the existence of free will. First, predicting accurately participants’ decisions from their preceding brain activity was rarely above 55% (chance = 50%) except very shortly before the conscious decision. Thus, conscious process- ing may have strongly influenced participants’ actions. Second, the requirement to make unpredictable and random responses reduced any pre-decision conscious processing to a minimum by encour- aging participants to use “automatic tie-breaking mechanisms” (Mele, 2013, p. 781). In contrast, most people make extensive use of conscious thinking prior to important decisions (e.g., shall I marry X?). Third, as Nachmias (2015, p. 78) wittily pointed out, if our decisions are made several seconds before we act, “we would all have died in car crashes by now!”. Fried et al. (2017) reviewed research indicating that frontal and parietal areas are of crucial importance with respect to conscious plan- ning, decision-making and a sense of agency. For example, Rens et al. (2017) found there was much greater activation in the fronto-parietal network (associated with cognitive control) when participants made vol- untary choices than when they were instructed which choice to make. More generally, a key aspect of human decision-making is our ability to use conscious processes to think ahead and plan goal-directed action (Fried et al.). Evaluation Various strands of behavioural and cognitive neuroscience research appar- ently cast doubt on the notion of free will. Behavioural research has shown we can have a mistaken sense of agency when we are not responsible for some action and we can also lack a sense of agency even when we are responsible for an action. Such findings are interesting and potentially important. However, they are often obtained in rather artificial situations – in everyday life our actions probably often depend on a mixture of con- scious and unconscious processes. Cognitive neuroscience research casts less doubt on human free will than sometimes claimed. For example, researchers’ ability to predict par- ticipants’ decisions from their preceding brain activity in the Bode et al. (2011) study was only slightly above chance. Thus, participants’ actions in that study probably depended in part on processes associated with early brain activity but this does not rule out a strong involvement of conscious processing. There is much evidence that conscious planning within frontal and parietal areas is of considerable importance in influencing goal- directed action (Fried et al., 2017). ASSESSING CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE How can we assess (and understand) conscious experience?

For example, we could decide whether individuals have conscious experience of an object by asking them to provide verbal reports of their visual experience. Alternatively, they could make yes/no decisions concern- ing the presence of a target object. Lamme (2006, 2018) argued that our actual conscious experience is often much richer than our report of that experience. Why is that? According to Lamme (2006, p. 499), “You cannot know whether you have a conscious experience without resorting to cognitive functions such as attention, memory or inner speech.” Thus, reports of our conscious expe- rience may be limited due to processes intervening between the experience and its report rather than limitations in the experience itself. Another problem is that different behavioural or self-report measures often produce different answers. For example, consider research on sublim- inal perception (see Glossary; and Chapter 2). Observers sometimes show “awareness” of visual stimuli when making forced-choice decisions about them (objective threshold) but not when reporting their experience (subjec- tive threshold). Under-reporting of conscious experience? Suppose you look briefly at a photograph of a social event and then imme- diately describe your conscious experience. You would probably refer to the main individuals in the photograph. However, you would probably not mention the size of the photograph, whether it is matt or gloss, or the distances between the individuals. Research evidence indicating we often under-report our conscious experience was reported by Sperling (1960; see Chapter 6). He presented a visual array consisting of three rows of four letters each for 50 ms. Participants typically reported only four to five letters but claimed to have seen many more. Sperling (1960) assumed this under-reporting occurred because rele- vant visual information faded before it could be reported. He tested this assumption by asking participants to recall only part of the information presented (e.g., the second row). As predicted, part recall was high provided the to-be-recalled information was cued very shortly after the offset of the visual display. Much subsequent experimentation supports Sperling’s (1960) find- ings. Two object arrays are presented several seconds apart, and observers decide whether a given object has changed between arrays (see Lamme, 2010). Performance was poor when this object was cued at the same time as the second array was presented. However, it was very good when the cue was presented some time ahead of the second array. Such findings suggest observers have access to considerable information for some time following the offset of the first array. There are two possible interpretations of the above findings (Gross, 2018). First, our conscious experience “overflows” our capacity to report it. In the terms used by Block (2012; discussed earlier, pp. 767–768), phenom- enal consciousness (our private experience) is richer and more extensive than our access consciousness (experience we can report). This approach is probably consistent with most people’s introspections, but that provides very weak evidence.

Under some circumstances, cueing can make observers consciously aware of these unconscious representations which are then reported. Evidence we can exaggerate the richness of our conscious experience was reported by de Gardelle et al. (2009) using a modified version of the Sperling task. Participants expected letters to be presented but sometimes pseudo-letters (real letters rotated and flipped) were presented instead. Participants rarely detected the presence of pseudo-letters. Thus, their conscious experience was less accurate and detailed than they thought it was. Over-reporting of conscious experience? Further evidence our conscious experience is less accurate than we believe comes from research on change blindness (see Glossary; and Chapter 4). Most people substantially overestimate their ability to avoid change blind- ness (Levin et al., 2002). You can obtain some sense of what is going on here by looking out of the window and taking note of what you perceive. Your conscious per- ception probably suggests you can see the entire view clearly. In fact, that is an illusion because peripheral vision is much more limited than central vision (Rosenholtz, 2016). Freeman and Simoncelli (2011) reported relevant evidence. Observers saw an original undistorted photograph followed by distorted versions of that photograph (see Figure 16.4). The observers could not distinguish between the original undistorted photographs and those with gross periph- eral distortions. Why isn’t our conscious perception of the world blurred? We use top-down processes (e.g., expectations) to fill in the gaps in the information available to us. Thus, as Cohen et al. (2016, p. 324) concluded, “We see far less than we think we see.” Figure 16.4 Undistorted photograph of the Brunnen der Lebensfreude in Rostock, Germany (left-hand picture) and distorted versions of it (middle and right-hand pictures). With rapid presentation and fixation at the centre (red dot), the two distorted versions appeared nearly identical to each other and to the undistorted photograph. From Freeman and Simoncelli (2011).

The most severe stage is coma – there is no conscious awareness and no wakefulness. The next stage is a vegetative state; patients in this state “appear to be awake but show no external evidence of aware- ness” (De Salvo et al., 2015, p. 237). The third stage is a minimally conscious state, involving wakefulness and some evidence of consciousness. This cat- egorisation implies that states of consciousness differ along a single dimen- sion. In fact, conscious states differ from each other with respect to several dimensions (Bayne et al., 2016, 2017; discussed earlier, p. 767). How can we explain differences between patients in a vegetative state and those in a minimally conscious state? Chen et al. (2018b) provided an answer. Conscious awareness in healthy individuals depends in part on connections from brainstem arousal systems and cortical areas. These con- nections are impaired in patients in a minimally conscious state but totally lacking in vegetative state patients. Much research interest has focused on vegetative state patients. Behavioural measures (e.g., responsiveness to external stimuli) provide no evidence such patients have conscious awareness whereas neuroimag- ing research indicates some vegetative state patients have partial conscious awareness (see Box). KEY TERMS Vegetative state A brain-damaged condition in which patients exhibit wakefulness but lack conscious awareness. Minimally conscious state A condition in which patients exhibit partial preservation of conscious awareness. IN THE REAL WORLD: VEGETATIVE STATE PATIENTS AND CONSCIOUSNESS What tasks would reveal whether some vegetative state patients have conscious awareness? Active tasks where participants generate the responses themselves by responding to commands are of special value (Owen, 2013). For example, Monti et al. (2010) gave a vegetative state patient various yes-or-no questions (e.g., “Is your father’s name Thomas?”). He was told to imagine playing tennis for “Yes” answers and to imagine navigating his house for “No” answers. The patient’s patterns of brain activity corresponded to the correct answers. Cruse et al. (2011) reported interesting findings on 16 vegetative state patients instructed to respond to two commands (“squeeze your right hand”; “squeeze your toes”). In healthy participants, these commands produce activation in the hand and toe motor areas, respectively. Three patients showed very similar patterns of brain activation (see Figure 16.5). These findings are impressive: successful task performance requires sustained attention, language comprehension (of the task instructions) and response selection. Monti et al. (2013) studied a patient with a severe disorder of consciousness. He was presented with superimposed pictures of faces and houses and instructed to shift his attention between the faces and the houses. His changing patterns of brain activation indicated the patient’s intentions were successful in changing his attentional focus. Kondziella et al. (2016) argued the demanding nature of active tasks may mean that conscious awareness in vegetative state patients is underestimated. Accordingly, they compared evidence of conscious awareness in active tasks and passive ones (responses were not required) by assessing functional cortical connectivity in networks associated with conscious awareness. Here are their main findings. First, 14% of vegetative state patients and 32% of minimally conscious state patients showed signs of consciousness on active tasks. Second, 26% of vegetative state patients and 55% of minimally conscious patients showed signs of consciousness on passive tasks.

Of importance, behavioural measures consistently indicate that conscious experience is absent in such patients. What are the limitations of research in this area? First, it is hard to interpret the differences between active and passive tasks reported by Kondziella et al. (2016). As they concluded, “Unresolved dilemmas include the lack of a gold standard for [assessing] consciousness” (p. 7). Second, it is also hard to assess consciousness in patients because it often fluctuates over time (Kondziella et al.). Third, we have only limited understanding of the conscious experience of vegetative state patients exhibiting signs of consciousness (Owen, 2013). In addition, most vegetative patients show no signs of consciousness and we do not know the extent to which this reflects insensitivity of assessment.

This approach typically involves relating behavioural measures of conscious awareness to associated patterns of brain activity. This approach has two advantages. First, it is theoretically important to compare behavioural and neuroimaging measures to identify their similarities and differences. Second, neuroimaging measures may assess consciousness more directly than behav- ioural measures if uncontaminated by additional processes such as atten- tion and memory (discussed above, p. 776). Several reviews on the neural correlates of consciousness are available (e.g., Koch et al., 2016). Here we will focus on two issues. First, prob- lems in establishing the neural correlates of consciousness are discussed. Second, we discuss the role of recurrent processing in conscious awareness. Findings of direct theoretical relevance are discussed in the next section. Major problems In studies on the neural correlates of consciousness, several brain regions are typically activated. We cannot assume all these brain regions are neces- sarily associated with conscious experience. Consider a study where visual stimuli are presented very briefly to observers, who indicate whether they saw each stimulus and try to identify it. The observers will use several cognitive processes (e.g., attention; monitoring their conscious awareness; remembering what they have seen; reporting what they have seen) addi- tional to conscious experience itself. As a consequence, it can be very hard to disentangle which neural activity is associated with conscious awareness and which neural activity is associated with other task-related processes (Storm et al., 2017). Relevant evidence was reported by Frässle et al. (2014) in a study on binocular rivalry (see Glossary). In one condition, observers indicated by button presses which stimulus they saw (active condition). In the other condition, observers simply observed changes in which stimulus they per- ceived without responding (passive condition). What did Frässle et al. (2014) find? Occipital and parietal areas were activated in both active and passive conditions (see Figure 16.6). However, frontal areas (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were much more activated in the active condition. If the researchers had used only the active condition, we might have mistakenly exaggerated the association between frontal activation and conscious awareness. In fact, that activa- tion mostly reflected processes relating to making behavioural reports (e.g., self- monitoring) rather than directly to conscious experience. Another problem is that of establishing the relationship between a given pattern of neural activity and consciousness. Neural activity may directly reflect conscious awareness. Alternatively, the observed neural activity may precede and influence conscious awareness or may occur merely as a conse- quence of conscious awareness (de Graaf et al., 2012). Another problem is that most research is limited in scope. There has been a strong emphasis on the neural correlates of visual conscious awareness to currently presented visual stimuli. Why is that? We can easily control the conditions (e.g., by altering exposure time) to ensure observers are (or are not) consciously aware of any given visual stimulus.

More generally, cognitive neuroscientists have rarely studied what Baumeister and Masicampo (2010; discussed earlier, p. 768) called con- scious thought. Feedforward processing and recurrent processing Lamme (2018) provided an account of the various stages of visual process- ing (see Figure 16.7) in the most recent version of his recurrent processing theory: (1) Fast processing starts in early visual cortex and proceeding to higher levels (Figure 16.7a); this feedforward sweep takes approximately 150–200 ms. Feedforward processing is not accompanied by conscious experience. (2) Recurrent or top-down processing starts approximately 100 ms after stimulus presentation and occurs between low-level visual areas (Figure 16.7b); it involves phenomenal consciousness (direct conscious experience). (3) Recurrent or top-down processing spreads throughout the brain (including prefrontal areas) (Figure 16.7c); it involves access con- sciousness (its contents can be communicated to other people). Why is conscious experience associated with recurrent processing rather than the feedforward sweep? First, the feedforward sweep involves fragmented processing of different kinds of information (e.g., shape; colour), whereas recurrent processing is integrated. Second, conscious visual experience is typically coherent even when the available visual information is ambiguous. Top-down processes (e.g., expectations) asso- ciated with recurrent processing are important in producing this coherence (O’Reilly et al., 2013). How can we prevent (or reduce) recurrent processing to assess its impor- tance for conscious perception? Masking is one method.

Alternatively, we can use tran- scranial magnetic TMS (see Glossary). TMS can be applied to early visual cortex to disrupt recurrent processing but not the feedforward sweep. Finally, we can study brain activation in brain-damaged patients with limited or no conscious awareness. Koivisto et al. (2011) used TMS to disrupt recurrent processing while observers decided whether natural scenes contained animals. As predicted, conscious visual perception was impaired. This finding suggests conscious visual perception partly depends on recurrent processing. Boly et al. (2011) found feedforward processes were comparable in vegetative state patients, minimally conscious patients and healthy controls when presented with expected and unexpected tones. However, only the vegetative state patients had impaired top-down connectivity from frontal to temporal areas indicative of reduced recurrent processing.

(2014) presented photo- graphs briefly followed by backward masking to prevent recurrent processing. Accurate cat- egorisation of photographs as showing or not showing animals was comparable with and without masking (86% vs 88%, respectively). However, participants reported less conscious awareness of what was shown on each pho- tograph under masked conditions (see Figure 16.8). These findings suggest conscious visual perception can occur without recurrent pro- cessing with easy visual tasks. Similar findings also using backward masking were reported by Koivisto and Rientamo (2016). Recurrent processing is not always asso- ciated with conscious awareness. Observers detecting white vowels in a stream of black and white letters were occasionally presented with unexpected square figures (Scholte et al., 2006). These figures produced recurrent pro- cessing but 50% of observers did not perceive them consciously. The figures were consistently seen only when there was widespread recurrent processing. Thus, conscious awareness can be lacking when inattention to unexpected stimuli is combined with limited recurrent processing. In sum, conscious visual perception is typically associated with the occurrence of recurrent processing, whereas feedforward processing without recurrent processing generally does not lead to conscious percep- tion. Recurrent processing may play an important role in producing the widespread integrated activity across the brain strongly associated with conscious awareness (discussed further below). However, simple visual discrimination (e.g., animal vs non-animal) can occur without recurrent processing, and recurrent processing of unattended stimuli is not always associated with conscious experience. Thus, there is not a direct one-to-one relationship between conscious awareness and recurrent processing. GLOBAL WORKSPACE AND GLOBAL NEURONAL WORKSPACE THEORIES Many theories of consciousness have been put forward. Here we will focus on a theoretical approach that successfully relates cognitive factors to neu- roscience. Global workspace theory was proposed by Baars (1988) and a similar global neuronal workspace theory was developed by Dehaene and Changeux (2011). Initially, global workspace theory emphasised behav- ioural data whereas global neuronal workspace theory focused more on identifying the main brain areas associated with conscious awareness. However, Baars et al. (2013) expanded global workspace theory by con- sidering the role of the cortex and thalamus in conscious experience. Both versions of global workspace theory have been highly influential.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\n784 Broadening horizons Here we focus on the main common assumptions of the two theories. First, it is argued early stimulus processing involves numerous special- purpose unconscious processors operating in parallel. These processors are distributed across numerous brain areas with each processor carrying out a specialised function (e.g., colour or motion processing; see Chapter 2). This early unconscious processing should be very similar regardless of whether a stimulus is subsequently consciously perceived. Second, it is assumed consciousness is associated with integrating infor- mation from these special-purpose processors relatively late in processing. More specifically, a combination of bottom-up processing and top-down control produces “ignition” leading to synchronised activity across large areas of the brain. This makes information globally available and corre- sponds to conscious experience. Third, it is assumed the brain areas associated with consciousness vary as a function of the content of conscious experience (e.g., visual areas with awareness of visual but not auditory stimuli). However, some brain areas are consistently activated during conscious awareness. For example, Dehaene and Changeux (2011, p. 210) emphasised the role of “prefrontal, cingulate, and parietal regions” in conscious experience. Fourth, it is assumed conscious awareness is typically determined by prior selective attention. Consider a sentence such as “I look in order to see”. The word look refers to attention whereas the word see refers to consciousness. In other words, attention resembles choosing a television channel and consciousness resembles what is presented on the screen. There are several other views concerning the relationship between attention and conscious awareness. Webb and Graziano (2015) identified five different hypotheses about that relationship (see Figure 16.9). The global (neuronal) workspace theoretical approach is most like (C). Webb and Graziano favoured hypothesis (E). According to this hypothesis, there can be attention with or without awareness. In the latter case, however, attention is under less control. Note that it is assumed within Lamme’s (2018) recurrent processing theory (discussed earlier, pp. 781–783), that conscious perception can occur in the absence of prior attention. More specifically, phenomenal consciousness can occur without prior attention, but access consciousness typically requires prior attention (see Figure 16.7). Integrated information theory Tononi (e.g., Tononi et al., 2016) proposed an integrated information theory. The theory starts with the key features of conscious experience. It then makes assumptions about the characteristics of the brain substrate required to support such experience. It is assumed conscious experience includes the following features: (1) intrinsic existence (accessible only to oneself); (2) composition (it has structure); (3) specificity (different from other experiences); and (4) unitary (content is integrated within a unitary consciousness). These key features of conscious experience mean it is typi- cally very rich and informative. What is the relationship between conscious experience and the underly- ing neural substrate?

As a consequence, it is impossible for us (with our limited pro- cessing capacity) to access all the information associated with those brain processes. In sum, integrated information theory has clarified the main features of conscious experience. Of most relevance here, the theory assumes the richness of conscious experience depends crucially on integrated activa- tion within large brain networks. This assumption is entirely consistent with global workspace theory (although the theories differ in many other ways). Note that the findings discussed below all relate to global work- space theory although some are also of relevance to integration informa- tion theory. Findings: early processing The first theoretical assumption is that early stimulus processing is un affected by whether or not an object is subsequently consciously Figure 16.9 (a) Awareness and attention are the same thing; (b) awareness precedes attention; (c) attention precedes awareness; (d) awareness and attention are independent processes; (e) attention is possible without awareness, but is under less control.

Much research supports this assumption. For example, Lamy et al. (2009) asked observers to indicate the location of a stimulus and indi- cate whether they had conscious awareness of its presence. Event-related potentials (ETPS; see Glossary) were recorded. The amplitude of early ERP components was unaffected by whether or not there was conscious awareness (see Figure 16.10). However, conscious awareness was associated with a late wave of activity (P3) between 400 and 600 ms after stimulus onset. The bottom part of Figure 16.10 shows brain positivity was far more widespread in the presence (rather than absence) of conscious awareness. Koivisto and Grassini (2016) used more sensitive stimuli and analyses and found the N200 (180–280 ms) was greater on trials when there was conscious awareness. Their findings suggest the N200 is directly associated with visual awareness whereas the P3 reflects additional conscious process- ing following awareness. Melloni et al. (2011) argued the time taken for visual awareness to occur might be reduced if a stimulus is expected. As predicted, differences between the ERPs to seen and unseen stimuli started 100 ms earlier for expected stimuli than unexpected ones. Of importance, the early stages of processing were very similar for seen and unseen stimuli regardless of whether these stimuli were expected. Figure 16.10 Event-related potential (ERP) waveforms in the aware-correct, unaware- correct and unaware- incorrect conditions. The greatest differences among the conditions occurred for the P3 component (shown in light grey). In the bottom part of the figure, the extent of brain positivity in the three conditions is shown in red. From Lamy et al.

This assumption makes much sense given that what we are consciously aware of is nearly always integrated infor- mation. For example, it is almost impossible to perceive an object while ignoring its colour. Melloni et al. (2007) tested the above assumption. They presented words that were hard to perceive and compared brain activity for those that were or were not consciously perceived. Only consciously perceived words produced synchronised (or integrated) neural activity involving frontal, parietal and occipital areas, especially between 40 and 182 ms (see Figure 16.11). King et al. (2013b) used electroencephalography (EEG; see Glossary) to assess integrated brain functioning in response to auditory stimuli using a measure known as weighted symbolic mutual information (wSMI). The four groups of participants had varying levels of conscious awareness: (1) patients in a vegetative state (no conscious awareness; see earlier in the chapter, p. 778); (2) minimally conscious state patients; (3) conscious patients with brain damage (often recovering from a vege- tative state or state of minimal consciousness); (4) healthy participants.

There were dramatic differences in the extent of integrated brain activity across these four groups (see Figure 16.12). As predicted, there was much more integrated brain activity in those groups having high levels of conscious awareness. Research on anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness has produced similar findings to those obtained with brain-damaged patients (Mashour & Hudetz, 2018). For example, Randt et al. (2016) found that the anaes- thetic sevoflurane reduced connectivity within higher-level frontal networks but not low-level sensory networks. There is evidence that disrupted infor- mation transfer at hubs (highly connected regions within prefrontal cortex) is especially important in unconsciousness produced by anaesthesia or brain damage (Mashour & Hudetz). The findings discussed in this section are clearly consistent with the global workspace and integrated information theories. However, there is a tricky issue concerning causality. Synchronised neural activity may directly reflect conscious awareness. However, it is also possible synchronised neural activity precedes and influences conscious awareness or that it occurs merely as a consequence of conscious awareness (de Graaf et al., 2012). Findings: key brain areas (e.g., prefrontal cortex) There is much support for the assumption the prefrontal cortex and related areas are especially likely to be associated with conscious awareness. For example, Neghavi and Nyberg (2005) argued similar brain areas are asso- ciated with consciousness, attention and working memory. They reported Figure 16.12 (a) Overall information sharing or integration across the brain for vegetative state, minimally conscious and conscious brain-damaged patients and healthy controls (blue = low integration; red/brown = high integration).

These areas represent the fronto-parietal network often assumed to be of major impor- tance to attention and consciousness. Gaillard et al. (2009) studied event-related potentials in response to visual stimuli that were or were not consciously perceived. They used epi- leptic patients and so had the rare opportunity to record ERPs directly from the brain with electrodes implanted in the brain (rather than scalp electrodes). Conscious awareness (from about 350 ms after stimulus pres- entation) was associated with much larger effects on activation in the frontal cortex than any other brain region. The above findings are correlational, and do not show activation of the prefrontal cortex is causally related to conscious awareness. For example, the findings may indicate prefrontal processes are involved in attention as well as conscious awareness. One approach to this causality issue is to study brain-damaged patients. Del Cul et al. (2009) studied patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex. It was harder for these patients to perceive a masked number than healthy controls, and the magnitude of this effect was greater in patients having the most damage to prefrontal cortex. Another approach to the causality issue is to apply transcranial mag- netic stimulation (TMS) to prefrontal cortex to inhibit its functioning. Rounis et al. (2010) found disrupting prefrontal processing via TMS made participants less aware of the quality of their information processing. Koch et al. (2016) argued the role of prefrontal cortex (or the fronto-parietal network) in conscious awareness has been exaggerated. For example, Markowitsch and Kessler (2000, p. 94) studied a young female patient with “severe degeneration of the prefrontal cortex”. In spite of that, the patient showed essentially intact conscious awareness. Goldberg et al. (2006) presented participants with pictures and audio clips. In one condition, they self-introspected about their emotional reac- tions to the stimuli; in a second condition, they categorised the stimuli (e.g., animal vs non-animal). Different brain regions were activated for each task. Of most relevance here, the prefrontal cortex was less important when stimuli were categorised than when conscious awareness involved self-related processes. Various findings suggest visual awareness is associated with numerous brain regions in addition to the prefrontal cortex and parietal regions. Bisenius et al. (2015, p. 177) carried out a meta-analysis and concluded: “[There is] a subcortical-extrastriate-fronto-parietal network rather than a single region that constitutes the necessary NCC [neural correlates of con- sciousness].” Several frontal areas formed part of that extensive network. Evidence indicating the prefrontal cortex can be activated during unconscious as well as conscious processing was reported by van Gaal et al. (2010). Participants were instructed to inhibit responses to a visible stimu- lus when preceded by a white square. When this square was visible, partic- ipants showed good inhibitory control associated with extensive prefrontal activation. Of greater theoretical importance, participants responded more slowly and had some activation in the inferior frontal cortex when the square was presented subliminally.

That probably sounds reasonable to you. However, several theorists have disagreed with that assumption. For example, Koch and Tsuchiya (2012) argued attention without consciousness and conscious- ness without attention are both possible. As mentioned earlier, it is assumed within recurrent processing theory (Lamme, 2018) that conscious awareness can occur without prior attention. Attention can influence behaviour in the absence of conscious aware- ness. For example, Jiang et al. (2006) presented pictures of male and female nudes subliminally. Each trial was followed immediately by a task with visible stimuli to assess direction of attention while the nudes were pre- sented. The invisible nude pictures influenced participants’ attentional pro- cesses. Heterosexual males attended to subliminal female nudes whereas heterosexual females attended to subliminal male nudes. How can unseen emotional stimuli influence attention? Troiani et al. (2014) discovered that subliminal fearful faces produced increased amyg- dala activation (associated with emotional processing). This activation in turn was associated with activation of brain areas formed an attentional network. The assumption within the global workspace approach that conscious awareness is always preceded by attention has proved controversial (Pitts et al., 2018, 2019). Of relevance are change blindness and inattentional blindness (see Glossary; see Chapter 4). These phenomena suggest that novel objects (or changes to objects) within a visual scene are rarely (if ever) detected consciously in the absence of attention. However, it has been claimed various other phenomena show conscious awareness in the absence of attention. Three are discussed below: (1) natural-scene percep- tion; (2) visual pop-out; and (3) iconic memory. We seem to perceive the gist of natural scenes without attention. However, that may be illusory. In a study by Cohen et al. (2011), observ- ers saw rapidly presented digits and letters against changing chessboard masks and counted the number of digits. Unexpectedly, a natural scene containing an animal or vehicle replaced a mask. Only 23% of the partici- pants could immediately identify the object in the scene and 50% reported no conscious perception of it. In contrast, when participants attended to the background, they classified the natural scenes accurately 93% of the time. Thus, attention seems necessary to have conscious perception of the gist of natural scenes. Visual pop-out occurs when a target stimulus is detected rapidly when it differs in some obvious way (e.g., colour; orientation) from surround- ing distractor stimuli. It has often been assumed attention is not required to detect such target stimuli. However, Cohen et al. (2012) reviewed the evidence and concluded the pop-out effect typically fails to occur when observers’ attention is focused on another task. Finally, we turn to iconic memory (very brief storage of visual infor- mation following stimulus offset; see Glossary) which is often assessed using the Sperling (1960) task discussed earlier (p. 776). Iconic memory has been assumed to be attention-free (see Chapter 6).

This assumption Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\nConsciousness 791 was challenged by Mack et al. (2016). Participants were presented with letters in the centre of a visual array (iconic memory task) and four circles surrounding the letters (the task involved deciding whether all circles were the same colour) but were only required to perform one task on each trial. Mack et al. (2016) found performance on the iconic memory task was much worse when the probability of having to perform it was only 10% rather than 90%. This happened because there was much less attention to the letters in the former condition. Most strikingly, most participants failed to note that all the letters had been removed from the screen when their attention was strongly focused on the circle task. These findings indicate that conscious awareness of information in iconic memory depends on prior attention. In sum, most of the available evidence suggests consciousness depends on prior attention (Pitts et al., 2018, 2019). However, this conclusion is disputed (e.g., Lamme, 2018). Agreement will be hard to achieve given the varying definitions of the terms “attention” and “consciousness” used by different researchers. Overall evaluation There is support for all the major assumptions of the global workspace approach. First, early processing of seen stimuli typically does not differ from that of unseen ones in patterns of brain activity during the first 200 ms or 300 ms after stimulus onset. Second, conscious awareness is generally associated with widespread integrated or synchronised brain activity. This integrated brain activity gen- erally (but not invariably) includes prefrontal cortex and parietal regions, and often the anterior cingulate. As predicted theoretically, anaesthetics inducing unconsciousness produce greatly impaired functional connectiv- ity within prefrontal networks, and patients with limited or no conscious awareness have considerably less integrated brain activity than healthy controls (King et al., 2013b). Of importance, research on patients with dis- orders of consciousness (e.g., vegetative state patients) indicates that recov- ery of consciousness is typically associated with enhanced integrated brain activity (Bodien et al., 2017). Third, the assumption that brain regions associated with conscious awareness reflect the content of such awareness has received support. For example, Eriksson et al. (2006) found that conscious awareness of pictures of objects was associated with activation in visual areas whereas conscious awareness of object sounds was associated with activation in auditory areas. Fourth, most evidence supports the assumption that conscious aware- ness is always (or nearly always) preceded by selective attention (Pitts et al., 2018). However, there may sometimes be rather limited conscious awareness of objects in the absence of prior selective attention. In addi- tion, the relationship between attention and conscious awareness is more complex than assumed theoretically. As well as effects of attention on con- scious awareness, there are effects in the opposite direction (e.g., Webb et al., 2016b): conscious awareness increases attentional control.

Created from usyd on 2022-02-17 03:28:58.\n\n792 Broadening horizons What are the limitations of the global workspace approach? First, its emphasis is on the neural correlates of conscious visual perception. Demertzi et al. (2013) drew a distinction between external awareness (awareness of the environment) and internal awareness (self-relevant think- ing). External awareness is associated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal regions. In contrast (and not con- sidered by the global workspace approach), internal awareness is associ- ated with activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. Second, the assumption that prefrontal cortex plays a major role in conscious experience has attracted much research support. However, there are findings suggesting its role may have been exaggerated (Boly et al., 2017). Third, much of the integrated brain functioning associated with conscious awareness is not necessarily the neural substrate of conscious awareness. Other possibilities are that integrated brain functioning is a pre- requisite or consequence of conscious experience (de Graaf et al., 2012). For example, prefrontal activation may reflect selective attention preceding conscious awareness. Fourth, identifying the brain areas and patterns of brain activity associated with conscious awareness is of value. However, this focus on cognitive neuroscience has led to a relative neglect of the associated psy- chological processes. Fifth, there are complexities in interpreting the findings from studies of anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness and unconsciousness in brain- damaged patients. For example, it is typically assumed in both cases that impaired integrated brain activity reflects loss of consciousness. However, it may also depend in part on loss of attentional processes (Mashour & Hudetz, 2018). IS CONSCIOUSNESS UNITARY? Most people assume they have a single, unitary consciousness although a few are in two minds on the matter. This issue became controversial because of research on split-brain patients, who have few connections between the two brain hemispheres following surgery. In most cases, the corpus callosum (bridge) between the two brain hemispheres was cut surgi- cally to contain epileptic seizures within one hemisphere. This structure is a collection of 250 million axons connecting the two hemispheres. The dramatic reduction in structural connectivity between the hemi- spheres in split-brain patients does not always produce an equivalent reduc- tion in functional connectivity (Uddin, 2013). Tyszka et al. (2011) studied patients lacking a corpus callosum because of developmental abnormali- ties. Surprisingly, the patients had largely normal functional networks in both hemispheres, probably because their brains had undergone extensive functional reorganisation early in life. Thus, they may differ importantly from patients lacking a corpus callosum due to surgery in adult life. It was not realised initially that cutting the corpus callosum caused significant problems. The reason is that split-brain patients ensure environ- mental information reaches both hemispheres by moving their eyes around.

For example, a patient, VP, was presented with break to the right hemisphere and fast to the left hem- isphere. She started to say “bre-” as in brake, but then instantly corrected herself, saying “breck”. The left hemisphere used the auditory input from the right hemisphere to produce the correct pronunciation. Split-brain patients typically have intact verbal IQ and problem- solving abilities. They also have the “illusion of unity”: “They report that they experience a single consciousness” (Volz & Gazzaniga, 2017, p. 2059). However, split-brain patients exhibit impaired laboratory performance when visual stimuli are presented briefly to one hemisphere, so the infor- mation is unavailable to the other hemisphere. Do split-brain patients have two minds, each with its own conscious- ness? Many psychologists subscribe to that viewpoint. Sperry (1968, p. 723) argued as follows: “The minor hemisphere [the right one] constitutes a second conscious entity that . . . runs along in parallel with the more dom- inant stream of consciousness in the major hemisphere [the left one]”. He regarded the left hemisphere as dominant because language processing is typically centred there. Tononi et al. (2016) argued in their integrated information theory (discussed earlier, pp. 784–785), that the physical basis of consciousness involves integrated or synchronised brain activity across relatively large brain areas. When there is little connectivity between the two brain hem- ispheres (as with split-brain patients), there are two separate regions of integrated brain activity with the larger region in the left hemisphere. Bayne (2010) agreed in his switch model that consciousness can occur in both hemispheres. However, he argued a single stream of consciousness switches between the hemispheres. Which hemisphere experiences con- sciousness depends on the allocation of attentional resources. The switch model can also explain why there are relatively few disagreements between the two hemispheres. However, there are considerable doubts whether split-brain patients have a truly single stream of consciousness. One reason is because most experi- ments are designed to ensure each hemisphere has access to (and processes) different information. It is more likely patients have two distinct streams of activity even if only one is accessible to consciousness at any given moment (Schechter, 2012). Another problem with the switch model is that split-brain patients would “experience radical and sudden changes in the character and content of their streams of consciousness” (Friesen, 2013, p. 96). Gazzaniga argued that the major conscious system (the interpreter) is based in the left hemisphere (dominant for language).

Patients following left hemispherectomy exhibit considerable plasticity – the remaining hemisphere reorganises to reduce the adverse effects of removal of the other hemisphere. If hemispherectomy of the left hemisphere occurs when the patient is a young child, there is typically good language development (de Bode et al., 2015). BL, a patient who had a left hemi- spherectomy at the age of five, had above-average intelligence (Vanlancker- Sidtis, 2004). Of major importance, there is typically “widespread [brain] rewiring” (Sebastianelli et al., 2017, p. 1427) following hemispherectomy. Additional evidence has been obtained from the Wada test – this involves injecting sodium amobarbital to anaesthetise one cerebral hemi- sphere. Meador et al. (1997) found basic aspects of consciousness seemed unaltered in 28% of patients when their left hemisphere was anaesthe- tised and in 41% of the same patients when their right hemisphere was anaesthetised. Before proceeding, note that information from the left visual field goes to the right hemisphere and information from the right visual field goes to the left hemisphere (see Chapter 2). More generally, the left half of the body is controlled by the right hemisphere and the right half by the left hemisphere. Note also that the typically limited language ability of the right hemisphere makes it hard to establish whether it has its own con- sciousness in split-brain patients. Two streams What evidence supports Sperry’s view that split-brain patients have two streams of consciousness? On that view, we might expect to find disagree- ments between the two hemispheres. Such disagreements have been reported occasionally. Mark (1996, p. 191) discussed a patient having speech in both hemispheres: “She mentioned she did not have feelings in her left hand. When I echoed the statement, she said that she was not numb, and then the torrent of alternating ‘Yes!’ and ‘No!’ replies ensued, followed by a despair- ing, ‘I don’t know!’”. Baynes and Gazzaniga (2000) studied a female split-brain patient (VJ), whose writing was controlled by the right hemisphere but whose speech was controlled by the left hemisphere. According to Baynes and Gazzaniga (p. 1362), “She [VJ] is discomfited by the fluent writing of her left hand to unseen stimuli”, which is suggestive of limited dual consciousness. More evidence the two hemispheres of split-brain patients can function simultaneously and independently was reported by Schiffer et al. (1998). Patients with their hands hidden from view behind a screen responded at the same time with each hand to emotionally sensitive questions. The right hemisphere produced more emotional answers. The ability to recognise one’s own face generally indicates reasonable self-awareness. However, patients with face blindness or prosopagnosia (see Glossary) often fail to recognise their own face despite good self-awareness. Uddin et al. (2005) found NG, a split-brain patient, recognised her own face equally well with each hemisphere. This suggests both hemispheres have basic self-awareness.

This view- point is supported by the following observation: “No split-brain patient has ever woken up following callostomy [cutting of the corpus callosum] and felt as though his/her experience of self had fundamentally changed or that two selves now inhabited the same body” (Colvin & Gazzaniga, 2007, p. 189). This observation also provides evidence against the notion that split-brain patients experience consciousness simultaneously in both hemispheres. Gazzaniga and Ledoux (1978) studied Paul S, a split-brain patient. He had unusually well-developed right-hemisphere language abilities making it easier to establish whether he had a separate consciousness in his right hemisphere. He showed some evidence of right-hemisphere consciousness by responding appropriately to questions using Scrabble letters with his left hand. For example, he could spell his own name, that of his girlfriend, his hobbies, his current mood and so on. There were some interesting dif- ferences between Paul’s hemispheres. For example, his right hemisphere said he wanted to be a racing driver, whereas his left hemisphere wanted to be a draughtsman! Gazzaniga (1992, 2013) discussed other studies on Paul S. He was pre- sented with a chicken claw to his left hemisphere and a snow scene to his right hemisphere. When asked to select relevant pictures from an array, he chose a chicken with his right hand (connected to the left hemisphere) and a shovel with his left hand (connected to the right hemisphere). The above findings may suggest Paul S had two separate conscious- nesses. However, here is how he explained his choices: “The chicken claw goes with the chicken and you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed” (Gazzaniga, 1992, p. 124). Thus, Paul S’s left hemisphere was interpret- ing behaviour initiated by the right hemisphere with little right-hemisphere contribution. Similarly, PS obeyed when his right hemisphere was given the command to walk. However, his left hemisphere explained his behav- iour by saying something such as that he wanted a Coke. Verleger et al. (2011) studied a male patient (GH) with anarchic-hand syndrome. This is a condition where one hand (the left in GH’s case) sometimes counteracts the other (e.g., GH put money on a shop counter with his right hand, but his left hand took it back). GH was slower and less accurate when responding to stimuli presented to his right hemisphere (and so requiring a left-hand response) suggesting he had “lost control over his right hemisphere” (p. 138). Verleger et al. (2011) found the P3 component of the event-related potential was much smaller to stimuli presented to GH’s right hemisphere. This suggests his ability to attend to stimuli and control processing was much less in that hemisphere. Of relevance, GH’s experiences in everyday life strongly suggested his consciousness resided within his left hemisphere. Hesselmann et al. (2013) reported similar findings in a male patient (AC) with severe damage to his corpus callosum. Two stimuli (one to each hemisphere) were presented 100, 300 or 800 ms apart with instructions to respond rapidly to both stimuli. We will focus on the ERP responses to the first stimulus. AC had a pronounced P3 component (reflecting attention KEY TERM Anarchic-hand syndrome Complex, goal-directed hand movements the patient does not initiate voluntarily and cannot interpret.

These findings suggest AC had much greater conscious access to information about stimuli presented to the left hemisphere. Summary and evaluation Research has not fully resolved the issue of whether it is possible to have two separate consciousnesses. The commonest view is that split-brain patients have conscious experience in both hemispheres with the left hemi- sphere playing the dominant role. This occurs because language processing is typically centred in the left hemisphere and because it is the location of the interpreter or self-supervisory system. This view is supported by find- ings showing the left hemisphere overruling the right hemisphere and by the persistent failure to observe genuine inter-hemispheric dialogue.

Consciousness within the right hemisphere is hard to assess fully because of its very limited language abilities. However, research using event-related potentials supports the view there is much less con- scious awareness in the right hemisphere, a view supported by research using the Wada test (see Glossary) on healthy individuals. However, the right hemisphere can develop impressive language and other abilities, and full conscious awareness in the absence of the left hemisphere, especially if hemispherectomy occurs early in life. The main limitation of research is that it is harder than might be thought to interpret many of the findings. We will consider a concrete example. Pinto et al. (2017) studied two split-brain patients (DDV; DDC) who had been operated on many years earlier. The patients decided whether a circle had been presented briefly; if so, they indicated its location. They responded using their left hand, their right hand or verbally. Note that the right hemisphere receives visual input from the left visual field and controls the left hand. In contrast, the left hemisphere receives visual input from the right visual field and controls the right hand and language processing. What would we predict? As Pinto et al. (2017) pointed out, the typical finding is that split-brain patients only respond to left-field stimuli when using their left hand and only respond to right-field stimuli when using their right hand or verbally. Such findings suggest such patients have a separate consciousness in each hemisphere. In marked contrast, Pinto et al. found performance was very good for stimuli presented anywhere in the visual field regardless of response type (see Figure 16.14). They concluded that these patients show “unity of consciousness” (p. 1236). There are two major interpretive problems with Pinto et al.’s (2017) findings. First, the patients may have learned over the years to compen- sate for the lack of connections between the two hemispheres by means of cross-cueing (communication between the hemispheres). For example, Figure 16.14 Detection and localisation of circles presented to left visual field (LVF) or right visual field (RVF) by two patients (DDV; DDC) responding verbally, with the left hand or with the right hand.

Second, the patients’ surprisingly good performance may reflect the involvement of a subcortical system that connects the two hemispheres even in split-brain patients. CHAPTER SUMMARY • Introduction. There is a distinction between conscious content and conscious level of consciousness. The notion of levels is oversimplified because it implies different states of consciousness lie along a single dimension. There is another important distinction between phenomenal or basic consciousness and higher-level consciousness (not restricted to the here-and-now). • Functions of consciousness. The functions claimed for conscious awareness include perception, social communication, action control, thinking beyond the here-and-now, and intensive integration of information. The machinery used to compute information about other people’s awareness is also used to compute information about our own awareness. Some behavioural evidence suggests perceived conscious control of action (sense of agency) is an illusion driven by the principles of priority, consistency and exclusivity. However, this research mostly uses artificial situations. Cognitive neuroscience research suggests some decision-relevant processing occurs prior to conscious awareness. However, the modest effects do not rule out a major role for conscious awareness. • Assessing consciousness and conscious experience. Our verbal reports of our conscious experience sometimes involve under- reporting because of our attentional and memory limitations. These verbal reports can also involve over-reporting. For example, visual perception is typically clear and distinct in spite of the deficiencies of peripheral vision because we use top- down processes (e.g., expectations) to fill in the gaps in the information available to us. Patients in the vegetative state show no behavioural signs of consciousness. However, a few show evidence of conscious awareness based on neuroimaging data obtained while they respond to orders. Some vegetative state patients also show functional cortical connectivity in networks associated with conscious awareness. There is evidence recurrent processing is typically required for conscious visual perception because it is associated with integrated processing within the brain. • Global workspace and global neuronal workspace theories.

Another key assumption (also made by integrated information theory) is that conscious awareness is associated with integrated, synchronous activity preceded by parallel non-conscious processing in special-purpose processors. The activity associated with consciousness involves many brain areas, especially the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate and parts of the parietal cortex. There is reasonable support for all the major assumptions of global workspace theory. However, research focuses on conscious visual perception and de-emphasises consciousness based on self-awareness and self-knowledge. Another issue is whether integrated brain functioning is a prerequisite or merely a consequence of conscious awareness. Finally, it has proved hard to disentangle the relationship between selective attention and conscious awareness. • Is consciousness unitary? Evidence from split-brain patients indicates they probably have separate consciousnesses in each hemisphere. However, the left hemisphere is dominant because language is typically centred in that hemisphere and because it is the site of an interpreter that makes sense of behaviour triggered by the right hemisphere. The limited language abilities of the right hemisphere make it hard to assess whether it is conscious. However, electrophysiological evidence from split-brain patients and the Wada test on healthy individuals indicate the right hemisphere has some conscious awareness. Interpreting findings from split-brain patients is complex. FURTHER READING Bayne, T., Hohwy, J. & Owen, A.M. (2016). Are there levels of consciousness? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 20, 405–413.
