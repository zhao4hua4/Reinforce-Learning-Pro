Language is defined, following Harley, as a system of symbols and rules, where symbols (words, morphemes, phonemes) stand for other entities and rules specify how these symbols may be combined into well-formed sentences. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  \n\nThe authors emphasise that, historically, language was neglected by behaviourist psychology, which reduced verbal behaviour to chains of learned stimulus–response associations. Chomsky’s critique of Skinner in the 1950s is presented as a watershed: language exhibits complex generativity and syntactic structure that cannot be captured by reinforcement histories alone, and humans appear uniquely equipped to acquire it.

{"id":"cogni_psyc_seg_2","section_path":["2. Speech Perception and Reading (Chapter 9)"],"page":null,"text":"### 2.1 Shared and Divergent Characteristics\n\nEysenck and Keane begin by comparing **speech perception** and **reading**. Both processes typically operate at high speed and are **incremental**: semantic and syntactic processes begin as soon as each word is encountered rather than after a whole sentence is complete. Adult readers typically process 250–350 words per minute, while speech perception can approach these rates in conversational contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  \n\nBoth modalities also involve **anticipatory processing**: listeners and readers continually generate predictions about upcoming words or structures, based on context, world knowledge, and probabilistic regularities in language. This predictive processing allows rapid comprehension and helps explain the brief gaps between speakers in conversation, as discussed later in the production chapter.\n\nHowever, the chapter emphasises important modality differences:\n\n- **Temporal vs spatial presentation**: speech unfolds over time and is transient; text is spatially arrayed and remains visually available.\n- **Segmentation**: in speech, word boundaries are not acoustically marked, making segmentation a non-trivial problem; in written language, spaces generally delimit words.\n- **Ambiguity and noise**: auditory signals are often degraded by background noise and overlapping speakers, whereas visual text is less susceptible to masking.\n- **Prosodic and gestural cues**: speech includes prosody (intonation, rhythm, stress) and often co-speech gestures that provide cues to structure and meaning; written language has relatively impoverished prosodic marking (e.g., punctuation). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  \n\nNeuropsychological dissociations (patients who can understand speech but not text, and vice versa) show that reading and speech perception rely on partially distinct pathways, even though they share some higher-level mechanisms.\n\n### 2.2 Speech Perception: From Sound to Words\n\nThe book presents **speech perception** as a mapping from continuous acoustic input to discrete linguistic units (phonemes, syllables, words) under challenging conditions such as coarticulation, speaker variability, and noise. Several key themes are highlighted:\n\n1. **Segmentation and coarticulation**  \n   Listeners must determine where one word ends and the next begins despite the absence of reliable acoustic boundaries. The acoustic realisation of a phoneme depends heavily on adjacent phonemes (coarticulation), yet listeners perceive phonemic categories robustly.\n\n2. **Use of multiple cues**  \n   Successful perception draws on **bottom-up acoustic cues** (formant transitions, temporal structure) and **top-down information** from lexical knowledge, linguistic context, and world knowledge. For example, ambiguous or degraded words are recognised more readily when embedded in rich semantic context than in isolation.\n\n3. **Categorical perception and phoneme identification**  \n   Classic work on categorical perception demonstrates that listeners divide continuous acoustic continua (e.g., between /b/ and /p/) into discrete categories, showing sharp identification boundaries and good discrimination only across category boundaries.\n\n4. **Context effects**  \n   Lexical context (surrounding phonemes and words) strongly influences perception. Listeners use the higher-level sentence context to disambiguate phonemes and words, consistent with interactive models in which information flows both bottom-up and top-down.\n\n### 2.3 Models of Spoken Word Recognition\n\nThe chapter then presents major **models of spoken word recognition**. While Eysenck and Keane discuss several frameworks, a central distinction is between **cohort-type models** and **connectionist interactive models**:\n\n- **Cohort models** propose that, as the word’s onset is heard, a cohort of lexical candidates consistent with the initial segments is activated. As more input arrives, incompatible candidates are eliminated until one word remains uniquely specified. Sentence context and frequency influence the competition process.\n- **TRACE model** (McClelland & Elman) is described as a **connectionist network** with feature, phoneme, and word layers. Activation flows bottom-up from features to phonemes to words, but also **top-down** (words influence phoneme activation) and **laterally** (via inhibition among competing words). TRACE successfully captures context effects, lexical competition, and the time course of eye movements in the visual world paradigm. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  \n\nThe evidence reviewed tends to favour **interactive models** with bidirectional information flow: speech perception is not a purely data-driven process but is constrained by lexical and contextual expectations.\n\n### 2.4 Cognitive Neuropsychology of Speech Perception\n\nUsing data from patients with acquired language disorders, the authors outline functional architectures of the speech system. A common framework includes:\n\n- **Auditory analysis components**, which map acoustic input onto abstract phonological representations.\n- An **auditory input lexicon** storing the phonological forms of known words. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  \n- Links from the input lexicon to **semantic systems**, enabling comprehension.\n- Optional links to **phonological output systems** supporting repetition.\n\nDeficits at each stage (e.g., pure word deafness, phonological decoding deficits) support the functional distinctiveness of these components and illuminate how normal processing is organised.\n\n### 2.5 Reading: Word Recognition and Reading Aloud\n\nThe second half of Chapter 9 deals with **reading**, focusing on word recognition and reading aloud.\n\n#### 2.5.1 Development and orthographic differences\n\nThe text notes that reading acquisition varies across orthographies: transparent writing systems (e.g., Spanish, Czech) show faster learning of grapheme–phoneme correspondences than deep orthographies such as English. Longitudinal data comparing English, Spanish, and Czech children show cross-linguistic differences in the developmental trajectory of reading accuracy and speed. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  \n\n#### 2.5.2 Word recognition: visual word identification\n\nA central model here is the **interactive activation model** of McClelland and Rumelhart. Letters in a word simultaneously activate letter detectors, which feed activation to word detectors while inhibiting inconsistent ones. The model explains phenomena such as:\n\n- **Word superiority effect**: letters are identified more accurately in words than in isolation or nonword strings.\n- Effects of **frequency** and **neighbourhood density** on recognition speed. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  \n\nThe authors emphasise that word recognition is an interactive, parallel process rather than a strictly serial left-to-right letter-matching procedure.\n\n#### 2.5.3 Reading aloud: dual-route and connectionist approaches\n\nFor **reading aloud**, Eysenck and Keane discuss two major theoretical traditions:\n\n1. **Dual-Route Cascaded (DRC) model**  \n   - **Lexical route**: familiar words are recognised and their stored phonological forms retrieved directly.\n   - **Non-lexical route**: grapheme–phoneme conversion rules map letter strings to sound, allowing pronunciation of nonwords and regular words.\n   - The model accounts well for the contrast between **regular** and **irregular** words and for **surface dyslexia**, where irregular words are mispronounced due to damage to the lexical route.\n\n2. **Connectionist “triangle” model**  \n   - Emphasises distributed representations linking orthography, phonology, and semantics.\n   - Learning via exposure to spelling–sound–meaning mappings allows graded regularity effects, frequency effects, and quasi-regularities.\n   - Explains how semantic factors can influence pronounciation, consistent with neuropsychological evidence that semantic impairment can affect reading of exception words. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  \n\nThe authors compare these frameworks and argue that while the DRC model offers a clear functional decomposition and fits many patient data, triangle models capture graded patterns and learning dynamics better. An integrative stance is encouraged.\n\n#### 2.5.4 Eye-movement research and reading\n\nFinally, the chapter reviews **eye-movement studies** of reading. Key findings include:\n\n- Readers make rapid saccades and fixations; only a limited perceptual span around fixation is processed in detail.\n- **E-Z Reader model** proposes that lexical processing drives eye movements: when word processing reaches a particular stage (L1 and L2), attention shifts and a saccade is programmed to the next word.\n- Parafoveal processing, frequency, predictability, and word length all influence fixation times and skipping probabilities.\n\nTogether, these data support a view of reading as a highly coordinated interaction of perceptual, lexical, and oculomotor processes.\n\n---","evidence":["### 2.1 Shared and Divergent Characteristics\n\nEysenck and Keane begin by comparing **speech perception** and **reading**.","Both processes typically operate at high speed and are **incremental**: semantic and syntactic processes begin as soon as each word is encountered rather than after a whole sentence is complete."]}

The authors review classic evidence that comprehension involves incremental parsing, often resulting in **garden-path** effects when initial structural commitments are later disconfirmed.\n\nThey then examine competing frameworks:\n\n1. **Serial, syntax-first models**  \n   - Initially, the parser relies primarily on syntactic principles such as **minimal attachment** and **late closure**, selecting the structurally simplest interpretation.\n   - Semantic and contextual information is integrated later, allowing reanalysis when necessary.\n   - Evidence includes early ERP components and eye-movement patterns showing rapid syntactic commitments.\n\n2. **Constraint-based models**  \n   - Argue for **parallel evaluation** of multiple parses constrained by syntactic, semantic, prosodic, and probabilistic cues from the outset.\n   - Lexical biases, plausibility, and prosody can modulate early parsing decisions.\n\n3. **Prediction-oriented frameworks**  \n   - Emphasise that comprehenders actively predict upcoming structures and words based on probabilistic knowledge (e.g., verb subcategorisation frequencies).\n   - Neural measures (e.g., reduced N400s for expected items) and eye-tracking show strong anticipatory effects.\n\nEysenck and Keane conclude that parsing is influenced by both structural preferences and multiple constraints, with prediction playing an increasingly central role. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  \n\n### 3.2 Heuristic vs Algorithmic Routes in Comprehension\n\nThe authors endorse a dual-route perspective on comprehension, distinguishing between **heuristic** and **algorithmic** processing routes. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  \n\n- The **heuristic route** uses fast, shallow cues (e.g., word order, semantic plausibility) to construct a “good-enough” interpretation.\n- The **algorithmic route** engages more effortful, structurally detailed processing when precise representation is required or when anomalies are detected.\n\nExperimental evidence shows that comprehenders often fail to fully revise initial misinterpretations, suggesting reliance on heuristics. However, under conditions of high motivation or explicit comprehension testing, deeper algorithmic analysis is more likely.\n\n### 3.3 Pragmatics: Beyond Literal Meaning\n\nA major portion of Chapter 10 addresses **pragmatics**, the study of how meaning in context goes beyond literal semantics. The authors discuss:\n\n1. **Conversational implicatures**  \n   - Based on Gricean maxims (quantity, quality, relation, manner), listeners infer speakers’ intended meanings that are not explicitly stated.\n   - For example, “Some of the students passed” often implicates that not all did.\n\n2. **Metaphor processing**  \n   - Traditional accounts assumed an initial literal interpretation followed by metaphorical reinterpretation when the literal reading is anomalous.\n   - More recent evidence suggests that conventional metaphors may be processed rapidly and directly, with graded involvement of literal and figurative interpretations.\n   - Response time and ERP data show that metaphor comprehension can be as fast as literal comprehension under supportive contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  \n\n3. **Reference resolution and common ground**  \n   - Comprehenders must map pronouns and definite descriptions onto discourse entities, using syntactic cues, information structure, and shared knowledge.\n   - Experimental work using the visual world paradigm shows that listeners use common ground and speaker point of view when interpreting referring expressions.\n\nOverall, pragmatic processing is depicted as interactive and context-sensitive rather than a strictly late, optional stage.\n\n### 3.4 Individual Differences: Working Memory Capacity\n\nThe chapter highlights **individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC)** as a major determinant of comprehension success. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  \n\n- Individuals with higher WMC are better at maintaining multiple interpretations, suppressing irrelevant meanings, and revising initial parses when disambiguating information appears.\n- Low-WMC individuals show greater susceptibility to garden-path effects and shallow processing, especially under high syntactic or semantic complexity.\n\nThese findings illustrate the interplay between general cognitive resources and language-specific mechanisms.\n\n### 3.5 Discourse Processing and Inference Generation\n\nBeyond sentences, **discourse comprehension** requires integrating information over extended texts or conversations.\n\n1. **Inferences**  \n   - **Bridging (backward) inferences** connect current information to previous statements to maintain coherence.\n   - **Elaborative (forward) inferences** enrich the representation with plausible but unstated details.\n   - Not all possible inferences are generated; rather, readers construct a representation tuned to task demands and goals.\n\n2. **Situation models**  \n   - The authors discuss theories in which readers build **situation models** (mental models of the described world) structured along dimensions such as time, space, causality, and protagonist goals.\n   - Empirical evidence (e.g., faster verification of statements consistent with the current state of the situation model) supports this view.\n\n3. **Construction–integration model**  \n   - Kintsch’s model posits an initial **construction** phase generating many propositions by spreading activation from the text and prior knowledge, followed by an **integration** phase that stabilises a coherent subset of propositions through constraint satisfaction.\n   - Forgetting curves differ for surface form, propositional content, and situational information, with situation models showing the greatest durability. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  \n\n4. **RI-Val model**  \n   - A more recent approach emphasising **resonance**, **integration**, and **validation** over time: information resonates with prior memory, is integrated into a coherent representation, and is validated against world knowledge and discourse context.\n\nThese models collectively portray discourse comprehension as an active, inferential process guided by coherence constraints and knowledge structures.\n\n---","evidence":["Chapter 10 addresses **sentence and discourse comprehension**, focusing on how syntactic structure is derived, how meaning is constructed, and how context and world knowledge influence interpretation.","### 3.1 Parsing: From Linear Strings to Structure\n\n**Parsing** is the process of computing the grammatical structure of sentences."]}
{"id":"cogni_psyc_seg_4","section_path":["4. Language Production (Chapter 11)"],"page":null,"text":"Chapter 11 turns to **language production**, primarily spoken language with a later section on writing. The authors note that production has historically been less studied than comprehension due to difficulties in experimentally constraining spontaneous output. Nonetheless, substantial progress has been made using error analysis, priming paradigms, and neuropsychological evidence. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  \n\n### 4.1 Relations Between Comprehension and Production\n\nEysenck and Keane emphasise that production is a **goal-directed communicative activity** influenced by social and motivational factors (e.g., audience design, politeness), not just linguistic constraints. Neuroimaging data show overlapping brain areas activated during speech comprehension and production, particularly in high-level regions such as the superior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. These regions exhibit **comprehension–production coupling**, suggesting shared representations or processes. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  \n\nThe **prediction-by-production hypothesis**, associated with Pickering and colleagues, holds that comprehenders covertly run their own production system to simulate and anticipate others’ utterances. This mechanism helps explain rapid turn-taking in conversation and some ERP and eye-movement findings.\n\n### 4.2 Stages of Speech Production\n\nMost contemporary models treat speech production as a multi-stage process:\n\n1. **Conceptualisation**  \n   - The speaker formulates a pre-verbal message: selecting communicative intentions, deciding what information to express, and organising it into a conceptual structure.\n\n2. **Formulation**  \n   - **Grammatical encoding**: mapping the message onto syntactic structures, specifying constituents and function roles.\n   - **Lexical selection**: choosing appropriate lemmas (abstract lexical entries with syntactic and semantic specifications but no phonological form).\n   - **Morpho-phonological encoding**: retrieving phonological forms of selected lemmas, adding inflections and function morphemes.\n\n3. **Articulation**  \n   - Motor planning and execution of the articulatory gestures needed to produce the utterance.\n\nEvidence for this structure comes from **speech errors** (see below), chronometric priming studies, and neuropsychological dissociations.\n\n### 4.3 Speech Errors as Windows on Production\n\nAnalyses of naturally occurring and experimentally induced errors reveal regularities that inform theory:\n\n- **Sound-based errors** (anticipations, perseverations, exchanges) typically respect **phonological and syllabic structure** and often occur between words in similar syntactic positions.\n- **Word-substitution errors** tend to preserve grammatical category and semantic field, suggesting separate levels for semantic selection and phonological encoding.\n- The **lexical bias effect** (tendency for sound-exchange errors to produce real words rather than nonwords) suggests feedback from lexical to phoneme levels.\n\nThese phenomena support models in which activation spreads across multiple levels (semantic, lemma, phonological) with bidirectional connections, allowing both competition and self-monitoring.\n\n### 4.4 Theories and Neuropsychology of Speech Production\n\nEysenck and Keane review computational models (e.g., Dell’s interactive two-step model) that implement these principles:\n\n- Semantic nodes activate lemma nodes, which in turn activate phoneme nodes.\n- Feedback from phoneme nodes to lemmas can account for lexical bias and some priming effects.\n- Temporal dynamics and probabilistic selection processes explain both normal fluency and error patterns.\n\nNeuropsychological evidence from aphasia is used to map components of these models onto brain systems:\n\n- Damage to posterior temporal regions may impair **lexical retrieval**.\n- Lesions in inferior frontal and insular regions are associated with **speech motor planning** difficulties.\n- Distinct dorsal and ventral pathways contribute differentially to phonological and semantic aspects of production, paralleling dual-stream accounts of comprehension. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  \n\n### 4.5 Speech as Communication and Audience Design\n\nThe chapter stresses that speakers shape their utterances for **addressees**:\n\n- They adjust lexical choice, syntactic complexity, and level of detail based on assumptions about the listener’s knowledge and needs.\n- Models of **audience design** portray speakers as using internal forward models to predict how listeners will interpret their utterances, similar to motor control processes that anticipate the sensory consequences of actions.\n\nExperimental work shows that speakers are sensitive to common ground and listener perspective, though they often rely on egocentric heuristics when cognitive resources are limited.\n\n### 4.6 Writing: Processes and Development\n\nThe latter part of Chapter 11 deals with **writing**, which, although less studied, is portrayed as a complex, resource-demanding skill drawing on many of the same knowledge sources as speaking.\n\n#### 4.6.1 Similarities and differences between speaking and writing\n\nBoth speaking and writing:\n\n- Share the core goal of communicating information.\n- Depend on the same underlying lexicon and syntactic knowledge.\n- Generally involve an initial **planning** phase followed by text generation.\n\nHowever, writing differs in several respects:\n\n- It is typically **slower**, more **deliberate**, and more **revisable** than speech.\n- It requires fine **motor control** and orthographic knowledge.\n- It places heavier demands on **working memory**, particularly in novices.\n- Children and many adults find writing substantially more difficult than speaking, reflecting the additional cognitive and motor requirements. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  \n\n#### 4.6.2 Cognitive models of writing\n\nHayes’ model is presented as a comprehensive framework with multiple levels:\n\n1. **Control level**: motivation, goals, and affective factors shaping writing behaviour.\n2. **Writing-process level**: **planning**, **translating** (text generation), and **revising**. These processes occur recursively rather than in a strict sequence.\n3. **Resource level**: working memory, long-term knowledge (topic, genre, language), and motor skills (handwriting or typing). :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  \n\nDevelopmental data show that novice writers allocate more resources to low-level processes (spelling, handwriting), leaving fewer resources for high-level planning and revising. With practice, some processes become automatized, freeing capacity for content and organisation.\n\n#### 4.6.3 Spelling and its disorders\n\nSpelling is characterised as a multi-route system analogous to reading:\n\n- **Lexical route**: retrieval of stored orthographic forms from an orthographic lexicon.\n- **Sublexical route**: application of phoneme–grapheme correspondences to spell novel or pseudowords.\n\nNeuropsychological cases show selective impairment of one route or the other (e.g., phonological dysgraphia vs surface dysgraphia), supporting this decomposition. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  \n\n---","evidence":["Chapter 11 turns to **language production**, primarily spoken language with a later section on writing.","The authors note that production has historically been less studied than comprehension due to difficulties in experimentally constraining spontaneous output."]}

Panbanisha acquired a substantial lexigram vocabulary and produced many spontaneous utterances referring to past and future events, challenging simple criteria such as spontaneity and temporal displacement. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}  \n\nNevertheless, the authors argue that non-human communication systems still lack several hallmarks of human language, including open-ended generativity, complex hierarchical syntax, and the ability to embed propositions recursively. Thus, while ape communication exhibits impressive learning and symbolic capacities, human language remains distinctive in scope and structural richness.\n\n### 5.2 Innateness and Universal Grammar\n\nReflecting on Chomsky’s proposal of **universal grammar (UG)**, the book considers arguments for an innate language faculty:\n\n- **Poverty of the stimulus**: the linguistic input children receive appears insufficient to account for their rapid and uniform acquisition of complex grammatical systems.\n- **Critical period phenomena** and **specific language impairment** are often cited as evidence for innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nHowever, Eysenck and Keane also highlight usage-based and statistical learning perspectives, which stress children’s ability to infer patterns from distributional information in the input, along with general cognitive learning mechanisms. They discuss **linguistic universals** (properties purportedly shared by all languages) and the ongoing debate over whether these reflect innate constraints, functional pressures, or historical convergences. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}  \n\n### 5.3 Language and Thought: The Whorfian Hypothesis\n\nThe **Whorfian hypothesis** (linguistic relativity) proposes that the structure of a language influences or even determines its speakers’ patterns of thought. Eysenck and Keane distinguish:\n\n- **Strong determinism**: language rigidly determines thought (largely rejected).\n- **Weak relativity**: language influences biases in perception, memory, and reasoning without strict determination.\n\nThey review empirical work on domains such as colour perception, spatial reference frames, and time metaphors. For example, languages that differ in their colour vocabularies or spatial prepositions show modest differences in categorical perception and spatial reasoning tasks, suggesting that language can shape habitual cognitive preferences while not constraining the full range of possible thought. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}  \n\nOverall, the authors advocate a moderate position: language and thought are deeply intertwined, with language both reflecting and shaping conceptual structure, but general cognitive capacities and embodied experience also play crucial roles.\n\n---","evidence":["In the introductory pages of Part III and related index entries, Eysenck and Keane address several long-standing debates.",":contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  \n\n### 5.1 Is Language Unique to Humans?"]}
